  "acid": {
    "short": "In technical terms, acid is a substance that can react with a base to make a salt. In practical terms, acid is the stuff you want to keep off your hands, or any part of you, because it will eat away your skin.",
    "long": "Not all acids will eat skin away. The citric acid in oranges and other citrus fruits gives them their tasty tang. There is a hallucinogenic street drug called acid that eats away at the user’s sense of reality. Words sometimes have the qualities of acid. In acidic speech, words feel corrosive to the listener’s sensibilities. This one’s perhaps the most frequent and most destructive of all."

  "oracular": {
    "short": "Something that's oracular is giving off an oracle-like vibe: mysterious, enigmatic, prophetic and probably a little weird.",
    "long": "Oracular in the simplest terms is an adjective that means \"resembling an oracle.\" Ancient oracles were thought to be mystic people that had some direct connection with the gods, like ancient Greece's famous Oracle at Delphi. There the oracle would sit over an open fissure in the rocks, inhaling strange fumes and speaking in oracular gibberish that had to be \"interpreted\" by a priest. Sounds like you might have better luck with a palm reader."

  "grandiloquence": {
    "short": "Grandiloquence is a lofty, high-flown style of talking that has a lot of fluff but may lack substance. It’s too grand to be eloquent, so grandiloquence is usually annoying.",
    "long": "Grandiloquence comes from the Latin word grandis for, yes, “grand” and loqui for “speak.”Grandiloquence is also related to loquacious (talkative), soliloquy (a solo speech), and other words about talk. Grandiloquence is a type of talk that is pompous and bombastic, full of pretty-sounding words and elegant turns of phrase that add up to nothing. Politicians who say nothing but make it sound important are masters of grandiloquence."
  },
  "perfidy": {
    "short": "If you shared your most embarrassing secrets with a friend who then told them to everyone he knows, his betrayal could be described as perfidy.",
    "long": "The noun perfidy means \"deceitfulness\" or \"treachery,\" so it's not just being mean, but deliberately betraying a trust. The Latin root of perfidy is made up of per, or \"through,\" and fidem, or \"faith.\" So in order for perfidy to happen, there has to have first been a sense of faith in place, which was then broken or betrayed."
  },
  "allusive": {
    "short": "Allusive means implying or indirectly suggesting something. If you broach the subject of your friend's strange hair cut in an allusive way, you hint around without ever directly referring to it.",
    "long": "Modern dances are full of allusive movements and gestures — they symbolize or suggest deeper meanings. Poetry is often quite allusive too, using symbols and vague impressions rather than straightforwardly addressing a topic. It's easy to confuse allusive with elusive, which is pronounced the same way but means \"difficult to find or achieve.\""

  "laudatory": {
    "short": "Laudatory has to do with praise. If you do great things, then you've done praise-worthy acts and people will use laudatory words when talking about you.",
    "long": "We all probably do something laudable at some point. If you play baseball well or just keep your room clean, then you probably receive laudatory words of encouragement. If I say, \"Your dog is the cutest, nicest pooch in North America,\" I am saying laudatory things about your dog. When you see laudatory, think praise."

  "persistent": {
    "short": "If something is persistent, it just won't stop. If you're persistent in your suggestions for a trip to Mexico, maybe your parents will eventually give in and take you there.",
    "long": "Persistent comes from the Latin verb persistere which means \"to continue with strength.\" A persistent salesman refuses to give up. A persistent ringing sound is one that repeats and repeats. Persistent rumors keep circulating, as does a persistent virus. Often something persistent is annoying. The related verb is persist, which means to continue to exist, or to go without stopping."

  "captivate": {
    "short": "To captivate means to attract others, fascinating or enchanting them. Some people are able to captivate with wit and charm, others with physical beauty, still others with intelligence.",
    "long": "Notice the similarity between the verbs captivate and capture. Both come ultimately from the Latin captus \"taken captive.\" Still, while both words mean some sort of hold on someone, capture sounds harsh, as though a trap has been set, while captivate is a softer, more attractive word that suggests there might be a willingness to be caught. Robert S. McNamara, a former U.S. secretary of defense, said, \"Coercion, after all, merely captures man. Freedom captivates him.”"

    "long": "Ephemeral (ə-FEM-ər-əl) was originally a medical term with the specific meaning \"lasting only one day,\" as a fever or sickness (Hemera means \"day\" in Greek.) The word became more general, coming to mean \"lasting a short time,\" covering the life spans of plants or insects and then eventually anything that is fleeting or transitory. A related word is the plural noun ephemera, meaning \"things that are meant to last for only a short time.\" Posters for a rock concert are often ephemera, unless the band is so famous that they get saved and sold on eBay."

  "reconnoiter": {
    "short": "When you reconnoiter an area, you’re looking around to try to get some kind of feel for the place. It often describes a military action, but you could also reconnoiter the breakroom on the lookout for doughnuts.",
    "long": "When you reconnoiter something, you typically explore it with a particular goal in mind. If you’re part of a military group, you might reconnoiter the coast to see where the navy might land. It’s a way to make a preliminary inspection so you can figure out what to do next. If you’re moving to a new city, you might reconnoiter several neighborhoods — you’re sizing them up to see if you might like to live there."

  "disseminate": {
    "short": "Disseminate means to spread information, knowledge, opinions widely. Semin- derives from the Latin word for seed; the idea with disseminate is that information travels like seeds sown by a farmer.",
    "long": "Think about a teacher distributing a hand out at the beginning of a class. The dis-  of disseminate and distribute come from the same Latin prefix which means \"apart, in a different direction.\" But unlike papers distributed in class, information, once spread around in all directions, cannot be pulled back in. Think about false rumors or political smear campaigns and you'll understand that dissemination is usually a one-way process."
  },
  "galvanize": {
    "short": "The verb galvanize means to stimulate or incite someone into taking action. Your impassioned speech might galvanize the other members of the Ecology Club to start a school-wide recycling initiative.",
    "long": "The word galvanize initially meant \"to stimulate muscles by administering electric shocks.\" It was coined to honor the 18th-century scientist Luigi Galvani, who found that a spark could make a frog's legs move. This discovery of \"animal electricity\" inspired Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, (a novel in which a mad scientist attempts to use electricity to galvanize a monster to life). Galvanize also means to cover steel or iron with zinc so it doesn’t rust."

    "short": "To be suave is to be smooth, polite, and a little bit cool. Men can be suave and debonair, especially the ones riding horses on the covers of romance novels.",
    "long": "Suave is from the Latin word suavis which means  \"agreeable.\" To be suave is still to be agreeable — a suave person knows how to work the room, and you might want to appear suave and sophisticated when you meet your sweetie's parents. Although it's an old fashioned compliment, suave has morphed into something meaning a little bit cheesy."
  },
  "oblique": {
    "short": "If something is oblique, it has a slanting position or direction. In figurative use, oblique means indirect or purposely misleading. \"What is two plus two?\" \"Fish!\" as an answer is completely oblique.",

  },
  "rigid": {
    "short": "Describe something as rigid if it's really stiff and not very flexible, like a super-strict practice schedule or an unbending, uncomfortable mattress.",
    "long": "The adjective rigid is actually related to the Latin word frigus, which means “cold.” So think of a rigid icicle or a rock-hard igloo to help you remember what rigid means. You can also use it to describe something that's particularly strict or unable to change, like the stubborn views of a person who just won't consider another perspective."
  },
  "agog": {
    "short": "The word agog means with great excitement and interest. When you’re falling over yourself with excitement and curiosity to see who’s coming up the red carpet next, you’re agog about celebrities.",
    "long": "At Christmas time, you are probably agog to see what's in all the beautifully wrapped boxes. An easy way to remember what agog means is to think of it as goggle-eyed, which it sounds a bit like. When you’re agog, you’re goggle-eyed with excitement about something, whatever that happens to be. In truth, the word has nothing to do with goggle-eyes, but instead relates to the Middle French word en gogues which means \"full of mirth, good humor, and joyfulness.\""
  },
  "incessant": {
    "short": "Something incessant continues without interruption. When you're on a cross-country flight, it's tough to tolerate the incessant crying of a baby.",
    "long": "In Latin, cessare means \"to stop,\" so when you add the negative prefix in-, you get a word meaning \"never stopping.\"  A near synonym is continual, but something incessant is more relentless; ceaseless is a closer synonym. It's rare to find incessant used in a positive way. Even incessant sunshine would grow boring."
  },
  "flinch": {
    "short": "To flinch is to react to pain by wincing, pulling away, or cringing. Often it's used to describe a person who shows a moment of weakness or fright: he was so tough, I thought he'd never flinch, but snakes really freak him out.",
    "long": "To flinch is to pull away suddenly or recoil when something frightens or hurts you. People flinch at different things. Needles, for example, cause some people to flinch, while they're not even noticed by others. If you can withstand something awful without showing it, you're likely to hear someone say \"Wow! You didn't even flinch!\" Think of it as a combination of flee and pinch. If you don't flee when you get pinched, you don't flinch."
  },
  "fawn": {
    "short": "A fawn is a young deer, but it's also a verb meaning to try and win favor by flattering. You might fawn over Bambi if you want to hang out with the cute and fuzzy gang.",
    "long": "As a verb, fawn either refers to an attempt to get on someone’s good side, or, oddly enough, to give birth to a deer. If you're a human, fawning is an age-old art that might get you what you want but can be very unattractive. If you ever come into possession of a great fortune, watch out for sudden friends who want to fawn over you and shower you with presents. They probably have dollar signs in their eyes."

  "taxing": {
    "short": "Taxing things are stressful and difficult. Climbing a mountain is taxing, and so is spending an entire day babysitting an unruly toddler.",
    "long": "Things that are taxing wear you out, either physically or mentally (or both). You may think of physical jobs like construction work as the most taxing kind of employment, until you realize how emotionally taxing it would be to care for sick patients as a nurse, or how mentally taxing you might find working as an accountant. This adjective comes from the verb tax, which means \"to put a strain on.\""

    "long": "Discretionary is often used to describe money that isn’t designated for a particular purpose. It’s up to the people in charge to decide how discretionary funds should be spent. Discretionary comes from the word discretion, which can be used to mean “the right to decide something based on one’s own judgment.” If you're given a task to complete at your discretion, you can decide how you want to do it — or whether you want to do it at all."

  "phantom": {
    "short": "Look over there, across the room.  Is that a phantom, some weary soul come back from the dead to haunt you?  Maybe it’s a shadow, or maybe it’s a ghost.  Either way, turn on a light and it’ll disappear.  Hopefully.",
    "long": "Sleeping is difficult if there’s a phantom in your room, because who can rest with ghosts around?  Some phantoms are real, but phantom can also be used to mean \"a trick of the mind,\" like hearing a person outside your window, but then realizing it’s only the phantom rustling of leaves in a tree.  Phantom limb is when someone loses an arm or leg, but their brain can still feel where their limb used to be."
  },
  "gist": {
    "short": "When you need a quick summary of the essentials, rather than the whole story or a thorough explanation, you're looking for the gist.",
    "long": "The word gist has had a variety of meanings in English, but most of them have become obsolete. The surviving sense of the word entered the language by way of the law: The gist of any legal action is the factor on which the action depends — that is, an alleged assault might be the gist of an indictment. The meaning of gist has evolved, though, and now it can be used to describe the core component of any matter, as in, \"He watched the trailer, but he still didn't get the gist of the movie.\" Or, \"She was having trouble writing a headline that conveyed the gist of her article.\""

  "assent": {

    "long": "As a verb, assent is generally followed by a phrase beginning with the word \"to:\" You assent to a plan, an agreement, or to an idea. Assent is also something that you can give. You can give your assent to marry your partner if he or she asks really nicely. The opposite of assent is dissent –– which means disagreeing, or even protesting in a formal way."

    "long": "Generally, moratoriums go into effect when something becomes seen as being not okay for now, but might go back to being okay later. After the water fountain started to burble up green sludge, the principal put a moratorium on drinking any water at school until the fountains were fixed and the water tested."

  "recluse": {
    "short": "A recluse lives alone, works alone, eats alone, and generally stays away from other people. Anti-social old hermits are recluses, as are a lot of students during exam time.",
    "long": "In the early 13th century, a recluse was a person who shut out the world to go meditate on religious issues. But nowadays recluses can think about whatever they want while they're sitting in solitude — they're simply people who shy away from social interaction and live secluded lives. Or think of the Brown Recluse spider, who likes to hide out in dark old boots or undisturbed corners of the basement."
  },
  "prescient": {
    "short": "To be prescient is to have foresight or foreknowledge. We can use this word to describe people themselves, or what they say or do at a given moment.",
    "long": "You probably know that the Latin prefix pre- means \"before,\" so you might be able to figure out that the word prescient, from the verb praescire, means to \"know beforehand.\" People like economists, sports commentators, and political analysts often get tagged with this word, because it's part of their job to sift through the data and make predictions — and sometimes they get it right. And when they're not just lucky, we might say they're prescient."

  "arbitrate": {
    "short": "If your two best friends are fighting over the last piece of gum in the pack, you might arbitrate by telling them to split the last piece. Arbitrate is when a neutral third party helps end a conflict.",
    "long": "Arbitrate derives from the Latin arbiter \"judge.\" (An arbiter of taste is a good judge of taste.) When you arbitrate, you are doing what a judge does in a court of law. In the US, to avoid litigation, many choose non-binding arbitration—where a neutral third party suggests a settlement."

    "long": "Proteus was a Greek god who could tell the future, but when he was asked a question he didn't want to answer, he would change shapes. With someone or something protean, you get all the power of shape-shifting, plus some of the menace of a god you cannot control."

  "demure": {
    "short": "A demure person can be described as polite and a little shy. A demure outfit is a modest one — think high neckline and low hem.",
    "long": "Demure is a word you don't hear a lot these days, but it used to be a huge compliment for a woman or a girl, for them to be considered shy and quiet and modest. Those days are over, thank goodness, because demure people are nice and all, but they're also a little boring."
  },
  "ambience": {
    "short": "Ambience is another word for atmosphere in the sense of the mood a place or setting has. If an expensive restaurant has soft lighting and peaceful music, it has a pleasant, soothing ambience.",
    "long": "Ambience is one of those words that we've out and out stolen from French. In French, the word meaning the same thing is, you guessed it, ambience. This is a word you're going to want to know if you have any interest in restaurant reviews — they always want to talk about the ambience. As a funny quirk, the word has a positive feel to it; it can be used to mean nice atmosphere without even using the word, nice, as in, \"Hey, this place really has ambience.\""
  },
  "regurgitate": {
    "short": "To regurgitate is to bring already swallowed food back up through one's throat and out the mouth. Not so nice in humans, but much more understandable (if still gross) in birds — who feed their baby chicks by regurgitating.",
    "long": "Finished cramming for your exam? Ready to do a data dump?

Similarly, Superman, with his chiseled looks, herculean strength, and good conscience, is an archetypal superhero. (Contrast him with Wolverine, whose retracting claws, violent outbursts, and brooding make him an archetypal \"anti-hero.\")"
  },
  "antithesis": {
    "short": "An antithesis is the complete opposite of something. Though the counterculture was strong in America in 1968, voters elected Richard Nixon, the antithesis of a hippie.",
    "long": "The noun antithesis comes from a Greek root meaning \"opposition\" and \"set against.\" It's often used today when describing two ideas or terms that are placed in strong contrast to each other. We might come across antithesis in school if we learn about the \"Hegelian dialectic.\" There, the thesis, or main idea put forward in an argument, is countered with its opposite idea — the antithesis — and the two are finally reconciled in a third proposition, the synthesis. An antithesis wouldn't exist without a thesis because it works as a comparison."

This noun was borrowed from French, from camarade, \"comrade.\" It retains the French spelling and Frenchlike pronunciation kahm-uh-RAHD-uh-ree. The suffix -erie corresponds to English -ery, used with nouns to indicate a quality."
  },
  "mediocre": {
    "short": "Mediocre is an adjective that means \"merely adequate\" or \"of only ordinary quality.\" A \"C\" is a mediocre grade for students who are fair to middling.",
    "long": "The roots of the adjective mediocre are from the Latin medial, \"middle,\" and ocris, \"mountain.\" If you think about it, the middle of a mountain is neither up nor down and neither here nor there — just somewhere in between. The definition of mediocre is \"of ordinary quality,\" \"merely adequate,\" and \"average.\" Another word that shares the same root is mediocracy, which means \"government run by mediocre people\" — an all-too-common condition."

  "lethargic": {
    "short": "When you feel lethargic, you're sluggish or lacking energy. Being sleepy or hungry can make anyone lethargic.",
    "long": "Being lethargic makes it hard to get anything done: you feel weak and sleepy. Whatever the reason, a lethargic person needs to snap out of it and get some energy, maybe by eating something or by taking a nap. Being lethargic also goes well with watching TV, since that takes almost no energy at all. When you feel lethargic, you don't have any energy to spare."

  "impulse": {
    "short": "An impulse is a sudden force or desire — this could be an electrical impulse, or an impulse to get some pizza.",
    "long": "If you act on a sudden feeling or thought, you’re following an impulse. That's like a whim: an impulse isn't something you've given a lot of thought. Another meaning of impulse is an electrical charge or pulse. Electrical impulses are coursing through wires all through your house every day. Both kinds of impulses make things happen. The electrical impulse keeps the refrigerator going, and then you have an impulse to eat all the ice cream in the fridge."

  "impromptu": {
    "short": "Some of the best kinds of parties are impromptu ones, when you decide at the last minute to get together. The adjective impromptu describes things done or said without previous thought or preparation.",
    "long": "Impromptu is also used as an adverb: Most people are not able to speak impromptu in front of an audience. This word was borrowed from French and ultimately derives from the Latin in prōmptū (\"at hand, in readiness\") from in (\"in\") plus a form of prōmptus (\"readiness\"). As you can guess from the spelling, the adjective and verb prompt are related to impromptu; they are from the same Latin verb, prōmere, \"to bring forth.\""

Synonyms of placid in both meanings include calm, serene and tranquil. In other uses, placid describes something with little disruption — like \"a placid neighborhood.\""

You're bound to get frustrated by the mendacity of your friend who's a pathological liar.

    "long": "Impel derives from the Latin in- \"toward\" + pellere \"to drive,\" which also brings us compel \"to force\" and propel \"to drive forward.\" The boy was propelled by his fears, but when he said fear of bullies impelled him to stay home on Halloween, his mother compelled him to dress and go outside."

  "austere": {
    "short": "The adjective austere is used to describe something or someone stern or without any decoration. You wouldn't want someone to describe you or your home as austere.",

    "short": "To apprehend is to capture or arrest, as when the police try to apprehend criminals and bring them to justice. You also apprehend a concept when you understand it, grasping or capturing its meaning.",
    "long": "The verb apprehend has remained much the same since the original Latin, both in form and meaning. It comes from apprehendere, \"to grasp or seize.\" The word came to refer to learning — \"grasping or seizing with the mind\" — but then came to mean \"seize in the name of the law\" or \"arrest\" around the 1540s, a meaning that remains to this day. The word can also be used to suggest an anxious feeling about something about to happen."
  },
  "ethos": {
    "short": "Ethos is the spirit of a time or society. It’s the set of beliefs a community lives by. Free spirits might live by the ethos of \"anything goes.\" Zombies might live by the ethos “eat more brains.”",
    "long": "The noun ethos refers to the particular rules and values that organize people, although the ethos can vary from group to group. For example, in some cultures individual rights might be highly valued, while in others the good of the community as a whole might be considered more important. The Greek root word ethos is related to “ethics” and refers to moral character. In rhetoric, an appeal to ethos means that a speaker attempts to persuade the audience that she is authoritative and credible."
  },
  "profess": {
    "short": "To profess is to declare something, often insincerely. Your joy on the last day of school might lead you to profess that you'll truly miss seeing all the people who annoyed you all year.",
    "long": "You can profess something and mean it, but more often the verb profess is used when someone lies about their true feelings. You might profess your love of your grandmother's tuna casserole, or profess that you never bite your fingernails, but you're just saying what you think people want to hear. The original meaning of profess described taking religious vows, and came from the Latin word professus,  meaning \"having declared publicly.\""
  },
  "abet": {
    "short": "To abet is to help someone do something, usually something wrong. If you were the lookout while your older sister swiped cookies from the cookie jar, you abetted her mischief.",
    "long": "The verb abet can be used to generally mean encouragement, but people usually expect to see it in relation to some crime. \"The singer was abetted by a pianist in her rendition of Silver Bells,\" for example, is a harmless construction. However, people more often expect abet in a sentence like this: \"She was charged with aiding and abetting the burglar because she drove the getaway car.\" Abet comes from an Old French word abeter meaning \"to bait.\""
  },
  "germ": {
    "short": "A germ is a tiny life form that spreads disease. Germs are also small things that grow into larger things — whether animals, plants, or ideas.",
    "long": "Germ is not a technical term, but you've probably heard it used in reference to tiny organisms (such as bacteria) that cause disease. A germ is also any small structure, such as a fertilized egg, that grows into something larger. A seed that grows into a plant is a germ. In some cases, you can talk about ideas as germs. The inspiration for a book or movie can be described as the germ of the project. Germs are small, but they start big things."
  },
  "gothic": {
    "short": "The adjective gothic describes something that is characterized by mystery, horror, and gloom —  especially in literature.",
    "long": "Gothic literature combines the genres of romance and horror. Some famous writers of Gothic fiction include Charlotte Bronte, Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe. Nowadays, though, if you refer to someone as \"goth,\" you are not saying they write a good ghost story; you are commenting on their pale makeup, black fingernail polish and Victorian fashion. Gothic can also describe something barbaric, rude, and unenlightened as if from medieval times. This use of the word is usually capitalized. The word is from the Goths, a Germanic people who invaded the Roman Empire."
  },
  "reminder": {
    "short": "A reminder helps you remember something. If you write \"don't forget lunch\" on your arm every morning, it means you need a reminder to grab your brown paper bag on your way out the door.",
    "long": "A reminder helps you remember, whether it's an appointment, an acquaintance's name, or a grocery list. You can give yourself a reminder, or write one to another person who's prone to forgetting details. The word's been around since the 1650s, and it came from remind, which originally meant \"to remember.\" Later, remind came to mean \"to make someone remember,\" or \"to put someone in mind of something.\""
  },
  "concession": {
    "short": "The noun concession comes in handy in negotiations — between countries, political parties, or even parents and their kids. Want a raise in your allowance? You may have to agree to do more chores as a concession before your parents will agree.",
    "long": "Although a concession in an argument is the act of yielding or granting something, don't get confused and think that a concession stand is called that because the workers are granting you popcorn at the baseball stadium. Concessions at a ballpark or at another venue are called that because the stadium has granted the right to sell food to a certain provider. Chew on that the next time you're munching on peanuts at a game."
  },
  "sobriquet": {
    "short": "If people start calling you \"Mac\" because you like to eat macaroni and cheese for every meal, then you not only have a strange diet, but you also have a sobriquet — in other words, a nickname.",
    "long": "Sobriquet is derived from the French word soubriquet. Sobriquets are often but not always humorous, so in order to pronounce this word, you might want to remember that the last syllable rhymes with play.  Sobriquets are usually given to you by other people, but you can choose one for yourself if you want. If your name is Jennifer and you tend to introduce yourself as Jen, this also qualifies as a sobriquet."
  },
  "hieroglyph": {
    "short": "A hieroglyph is a picture that represents a word or part of a word. Several ancient cultures, including Egyptians and Mayans, used hieroglyphs as part of their writing systems.",
    "long": "The earliest hieroglyphs archaeologists have found were carved in stone around 3000 BCE, in Egypt. These symbols and pictures were clearly not just illustrations, but part of a true written language . Each hieroglyph stood for an object or action, represented the sound of a syllable, and made the meaning of surrounding hieroglyphs clear. The Greek roots of this word are hieros,  \"sacred,\" and glyphe, \"carving.\""
  },
  "vengeance": {
    "short": "If someone hurts you, you might be inspired to plan an act of vengeance: some type of payback in order to settle the score. Be careful, though, because you might inspire someone to take vengeance on you in return.",
    "long": "Vengeance is a downward spiral of pain and betrayal, one person hurting another, who hurts another, and so on. You might demand vengeance if your brother throws your favorite jeans into a tree, and your brother might feel the same way after you spit gum in his hair. The phrase “with a vengeance” means to do something with a lot of intensity. Vengeance shares roots with the word revenge, and someone who wants revenge usually pursues it with a vengeance."
  },
  "ligneous": {
    "short": "If something's made of wood, or looks like it is, it's ligneous. A tree is a ligneous plant. A stiff politician is a ligneous person.",
    "long": "Ligneous is a technical term, the kind that scientists like, so if you want to describe something as wood-like in a casual conversation or an informal piece of writing, it's probably best to go with, well, wood-like, or woody. Use ligneous if you're deliberately trying to sound like someone who spends a lot of time looking into a microscope."
  },
  "sophomore": {
    "short": "A sophomore is in their second year, either in high school or college.  Once you became a sophomore, thinking you now knew everything, you pitied the freshmen for their confusion over how to write college papers.",
    "long": "Sophomore comes from the word sophism which means \"a bad argument that's clever but false,\" and that's sometimes how sophomores in college act. They're not bright-eyed newcomers anymore, and think they know a lot, but really they've much to learn. We also use the word for other seconds: a band's second album is usually called their sophomore album."
  },
  "saturate": {
    "short": "The verb saturate means to cause something to be fully soaked to the point where it can't take on anything else. A heavy rainstorm can saturate the ground, leaving puddles on the lawn because no more water can be absorbed.",
    "long": "The word saturate comes from the Latin word saturatus, meaning \"to fill full, sate, drench.\" Saturate is often used to describe the aftermath of a big rainstorm, but other things can be saturated as well. If you're a workaholic, you might saturate all your free time with work, leaving no time to spend with your family. In chemistry, saturate describes causing one substance, like a solution, to take on the greatest amount of another substance."
  },
  "verbose": {
    "short": "If you're verbose, you use far more words than you need to. A verbose book report goes on and on and is packed with long, complicated words that aren't at all necessary.",
    "long": "If a friend asks, \"Did you have fun at the party?\" you can simply answer, \"No.\" Or you can provide a verbose reply that describes just how much you hated the party, who was and wasn't there, the fact that you got lost on the way, the terrible food that was served, and the awful music that was played. Verbose is from Latin verbosus \"full of words,\" from verbum, \"word or verb.\" As you can guess from the spelling, the English verb is closely related."
  },
  "apologist": {
    "short": "An apologist is a person who argues in favor of something unpopular. If you're an apologist for deep sea oil drilling, you would argue that drilling in the ocean is necessary and the benefits make up for any environmental damage.",
    "long": "Apologists tend to be seen in a negative light, as defensive people who make excuses. The word apologist comes from the Greek word apologia, meaning \"speaking in defense.\" Not all apologists are bad news; some just defend an unpopular idea. Even though apologist is similar to apology, don't confuse them — if you make an apology you're admitting to being wrong. But if you're an apologist, you justify your belief or action, and would do it all again!"
  },
  "acquisitive": {
    "short": "It may seem like your acquisitive cousin never talks about anything but shopping. Someone who's acquisitive is preoccupied with possessing material things.",
    "long": "If you were trying to improve yourself by becoming less acquisitive, you might destroy your credit cards and force yourself to take a break from buying things. The adjective acquisitive comes from Latin word for \"accumulate,\" acquirere, so when you're consumed with accumulating more and more, you can describe yourself as acquisitive. It's an easy word to confuse with inquisitive, which means \"curious or inquiring.\" It's much better to be inquisitive than acquisitive!"
  },
  "latent": {
    "short": "Latent is an adjective that you use to describe something that is capable of becoming active or at hand, though it is not currently so.",
    "long": "The adjective latent is a tricky word to define because it refers to something there but not there. That is, latent means something that is capable of becoming active or at hand but has not yet achieved that state. The word arrived in Middle English from the Latin word latēre which means \"to lie hidden.\" It can have somewhat negative connotations because it is often used in a medical context, as in a latent illness or infection, but it can also mean good things, such as someone discovering they have latent talents or capabilities."
  },
  "ponderous": {
    "short": "When you call Frankenstein's monster ponderous, it's not because he likes to ponder the great questions of life. It's because he moves like a Mack truck, only slower and less gracefully.",
    "long": "Ponderous also describes a person's manner, or their manner of speaking. If it does, this is a person you will want to avoid. They're solemn, speak slowly about things that are boring, and get to the punchline of a joke about seven years after anyone with half a brain has figured it out for themselves."
  },
  "jingoism": {
    "short": "Jingoism is fanatical, over-the-top patriotism. If you refuse to eat, read, wear, or discuss anything that wasn't made in your own country, people might accuse you of jingoism.",
    "long": "Jingoism comes from the word jingo, the nickname for a group of British people who always wanted to go to war to prove the superiority of Britain. Now we use jingoism for that kind of aggressive, chauvinistic behavior in any country, or for things intended to stir up war-thirst and blind patriotism. If you see a TV show tries to get viewers to support a military cause without a critical look at whether war is necessary, call it jingoism."
  },
  "chary": {
    "short": "Being chary (pronounced CHAIR-ee) is being wary or cautious. If you lost two teeth in last year’s rugby season, you should be chary of signing up again this year.",
    "long": "Chary comes from the Old English word cearig for \"sorrowful, careful,\" which is basically what you are if you’re chary. If you’re a little suspicious of something and mulling it over, you’re being chary. A synonym of chary is wary, and both include caution, but some definitions suggest that it's obvious when someone is wary — it shows — while being chary is more of an inside, or hidden, distrust."
  },
  "malingerer": {
    "short": "Have you ever pretended to be sick or hurt to get out of taking a test or doing a chore? Then you, my dear, are a malingerer, and should be ashamed of yourself. Shape up!",
    "long": "Knowing that the prefix mal is from the Latin for “bad,” we can tell right off that being a malingerer is not a good thing. This noun form of the verb malinger comes from the French malingre which means “sickly.” (Obviously, it’s bad to pretend to be sick.) In Jack London’s Call of the Wild, the new dog, Pike, is referred to as “a clever malingerer and thief,” giving a clear negative context to the word."
  },
  "subsistence": {
    "short": "Subsistence means the minimal resources that are necessary for survival. If you work for subsistence, you'll probably receive food, water, and lodging (internet access not included).",
    "long": "Subsistence can be used in a variety of subtly different ways. In addition to referring to necessities for survival, it can indicate one's means of obtaining those necessities (usually a job). And if you feel like getting philosophical, subsistence can refer to the very act of existence itself."
  },
  "cupidity": {
    "short": "Remember the saying “Greed is good”? It could just as easily be “Cupidity is good,” though admittedly it doesn’t roll off the tongue quite the same way. Cupidity means a burning desire to have more wealth than you need.",
    "long": "Though it sounds like it might have something to do with the little winged figure who shoots arrows and makes folks fall in love on Valentine’s Day, cupidity is all about the love of money. It comes to us from Latin cupidus, which means \"desirous.\" It’s not a word that crops up a lot in conversation, though you might run across it in newspapers and magazines, particularly those blaming Wall Street’s unbridled cupidity for America’s economic woes."
  },
  "reverberate": {
    "short": "If you give a loud shout in a cavernous place, like a gym or a church, the sound of your voice will reverberate throughout the room. Reverberate means sound waves traveling back and forth, as in an echo.",
    "long": "Often we use reverberate to talk about sound, or sometimes light. If a noise echoes for a long time, we can say the space reverberates with that noise. You may have heard of a reverb effect in audio processing, which is basically a long echo. We also use the word metaphorically to describe the impact of huge events. For example, the 2008 mortgage crisis in the U.S. reverberated throughout the world’s economy, causing a global recession."
  },
  "bigoted": {
    "short": "When someone is acting in a bigoted way, he believes his beliefs, culture, or background is superior to others. The Civil Rights Movement fought against the bigoted behavior of whites against blacks.",
    "long": "A bigoted person doesn't tolerate the opinions of others, and never rethinks his position. Usually when we call someone bigoted, he is hostile to people who are different than him either by race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. While the \"-ed\" construction of the word might be a bit misleading, someone bigoted is the one expressing bigotry, not the one afflicted by it."
  },
  "stilted": {
    "short": "The adjective stilted describes something—usually a style of writing or speaking—that is unnaturally formal.",
    "long": "Imagine someone walking awkwardly on a pair of stilts and you have a good impression of the word stilted — wooden and stiff. Stilt is found in the mid-15th century, referring to walking on wooden stilts across marshy ground. A hundred years later, the word stilted came to refer to the posts holding up a building. It wasn't until 1820 that the word was used as we use it now, to describe writing or speaking that does not flow smoothly."
  },
  "fester": {
    "short": "To fester is to grow and spread, not in a good way. When a cut gets infected it starts to fester and smell bad. Emotional wounds stink too, like when you hold on to anger or pain until it starts to fester and explodes.",
    "long": "Fester is a verb describing what happens to a wound or a sore that gets worse and has liquid, or pus, oozing out. Infections cause cuts, broken bones, and diseases to fester. Dead bodies can fester too — as they decompose. Things that fester have a decaying odor, and bad feelings can have a decaying effect on friendships and the heart. Letting bitter emotions fester often leads to their getting worse."
  },
  "nostrum": {
    "short": "Though you try many medicines that claim to cure your cold, none of them work. They turn out to be nostrums, or ineffective drugs.",
    "long": "Nostrum refers to a cure-all, a drug, or a medicine that is ineffectual. Before drugs were regulated by the government, there were many nostrums sold to the public. “Snake oil” is one of the most well-known. Said to cure any ailment from achy joints to hair loss, snake oil concoctions could contain a number of ingredients — including camphor, red pepper, and turpentine."
  },
  "kinetic": {
    "short": "If you marvel at the kinetic pace of popular cartoons, you are amazed at how lively and energetic the shows are. Kinetic comes from a Greek verb meaning \"to move.\"",
    "long": "Used generally, kinetic can simply mean \"animated,\" \"dynamic,\" or \"lively,\" but it also has more specific meanings in the realms of art and science. Kinetic drawings, sculptures, and installations have moving parts. Alexander Calder's mobiles are well-known examples of kinetic art. In physics, the phrase \"kinetic energy\" is used to describe the energy of motion. Any object in motion possesses kinetic energy, and this energy can be harnessed, transferred, and transformed to do work: Think of wind turning turbines to generate electricity."
  },
  "polemic": {
    "short": "A polemic is something that stirs up controversy by having a negative opinion, usually aimed at a particular group. A piece of writing can be a polemic, as long as it gets someone's goat.",
    "long": "Polemic comes from the Greek polemikos meaning \"warlike, belligerent.\" It's like challenging someone to a duel of ideas. These days a polemic is usually a piece of writing, such as if the Grinch published a powerful polemic against Christmas. It's like a debate, and philosophers from Nietzsche to Voltaire are known for theirs. The British philosopher John Stuart Mill had this to say about it: \"The worst offense that can be committed by a polemic is to stigmatize those who hold a contrary opinion as bad and immoral men.\""
  },
  "faddish": {
    "short": "Something that's faddish is in style, often for a brief length of time.",
    "long": "Flapper dresses and bobbed hair were faddish in the 1920's, and long hair and bell bottoms were faddish in the 1960's and 70's. Among elementary school kids, it was faddish in the early 2000's to collect and trade Pokemon cards. The adjective faddish comes from the word fad, which was coined in the 1880's, either from fiddle-faddle or from the Latin word for \"stupid,\" fatuus."
  },
  "hauteur": {
    "short": "Hauteur is an obnoxious display of overbearing pride and superiority over others. Rather than showing humility and respect, a bad king might act with hauteur toward his subjects.",
    "long": "The noun hauteur stems from the Old English word haute, meaning \"high in one's own estimation.\"  Because it often develops as a result of power over others (or perceived power), it's often associated with royalty or politically powerful figures who throughout history have become vain and arrogant because of their position: A high-powered CEO might show hauteur toward the newly hired assistant; a professional athlete's hauteur may result from the media spotlight and multi-million-dollar contracts."
  },
  "commonplace": {
    "short": "Something commonplace is ordinary. It can also be something dull and unchallenging or tired and clichéd. Coffee shops in cities are commonplace, so are berets in Paris. You see them all over the place.",
    "long": "Things that are common can be found all over the place — they're commonplace! The word is a literal translation of the Latin locus communis for \"general topic.\" Commonplace things and behavior are ordinary. For example, a commonplace job is a boring, mind-numbing task. It’s humdrum and unglamorous. A commonplace word or saying is a cliché — it's so common that it becomes meaningless and annoying."
  },
  "forage": {
    "short": "To forage is to wander around looking for food. When it’s cold and snowy outside, birds may forage for food in your backyard, digging around for whatever they can find.",
    "long": "The verb forage often describes animals searching for food, but it can also be applied to people. In those circumstances it retains the slightly desperate sense of coming up with whatever is available. For example, if you want to cook dinner but have no time to go to the grocery store, you might forage your refrigerator and cabinets to find good substitutes for ingredients in your recipe."
  },
  "obnoxious": {
    "short": "If something is obnoxious, it's annoying and unpleasant. Generally, people like to avoid obnoxious folks.",
    "long": "If something is driving you absolutely crazy, it's probably obnoxious. Yelling and stomping your feet is obnoxious. Poking someone repeatedly is obnoxious. Driving like a maniac is obnoxious. If the teacher comes in and finds students jumping up and down and throwing books, she might say, \"Stop being so obnoxious!\" Any time someone is obnoxious, someone else probably wants them to stop it."
  },
  "fraud": {
    "short": "A fraud is a something that deceives or tricks another person, usually to get their money. Frauds are dishonest.",
    "long": "A fraud is something that sounds too good to be true — because it isn't. If you're promised millions of dollars by anyone on the Internet, that's got to be a fraud. Anyone trying to sell you a bridge is committing fraud. Identity theft is a type of fraud. Democrats and Republicans frequently accuse the other party of fraud when it comes to counting votes. You can also tell a person who is fake or an impostor is a fraud."
  },
  "escalator": {
    "short": "An escalator is a motorized stairway that moves people up and down flights. When you get on an escalator, you can stand still and let it carry you. If you want to really annoy the people behind you, stand to the left on the escalator and block their passage.",
    "long": "It's common for shopping malls, airports, and other large, public buildings to provide escalators as a way for people to get from one floor to another. An escalator works by moving a large belt of linked steps with a motor — each step seems to disappear as it moves parallel with the floor at your destination. In 1900, the Otis Elevator Company coined the word escalator, from escalade, \"use ladders to scale a wall.\""
  },
  "stoop": {
    "short": "Stoop means to lean your head and torso forward and down. If you're six feet tall and you tour a historical building, you'll have to stoop to get through the low doorways.",
    "long": "Stoop comes from the same root as steep. You can stoop to clear a doorway, or stoop metaphorically, by lowering your morals. If you slouch and droop, you are stooping. When owls quickly descend on their prey, that's also called stooping. Last but not least, a stoop refers to a small porch or the stairs leading up to a front entrance of a house, but that meaning is from the Dutch word stoep, \"flight of steps, doorstep, or threshold.\""
  },
  "vitality": {
    "short": "Are you full of life? Vigorous and energetic? Lucky you. You have vitality, the state of being strong and in great health.",
    "long": "Vitality also has the general meaning of \"life force,\" as in the mysterious power that separates the living from the dead. The phrase \"vital organs\" comes from vitality, meaning a person's inner organs most essential to life. Abstract things can also have vitality, as in \"the vitality of the state\" or the vitality of Broadway Theater.\""
  },
  "cynic": {
    "short": "A cynic is someone who believes that humans are selfish and that they only do something if it will benefit themselves.  Cynics criticize acts of kindness and will probably tease you if you help an old lady cross the street.",
    "long": "Maybe you know a cynic or two.  They like to criticize people and situations, especially if they think there’s a deeper motivation behind the more obvious one.  Let’s say a friend borrows your car, and then he shows up later covered in grease and offers you a lollipop.  If you’re a cynic, you’d suspect that your friend crashed your car and is trying to distract you with the delicious and sweet lollipop.  And you might be right."
  },
  "intersection": {
    "short": "An intersection is a point where two lines or streets cross.",
    "long": "There are two places you're most likely to find intersections: in math class and in traffic. In math, an intersection is the spot where two lines cross. Those lines share this common point. The center of the letter X is an intersection. The same is true for streets: the intersection of Clark and Huron is where those streets cross. From the intersection, you can choose to travel down either street. When you're trying to get somewhere, it's helpful to know the major intersections."
  },
  "reciprocity": {
    "short": "When two or more people or nations have equal exchanges of goods or services, they are enjoying reciprocity, a situation where each enjoys an equal benefit from the relationship.",
    "long": "The background of the word reciprocity can be traced to the Latin reciprocus which means, logically enough, \"moving back and forth.\" This is an appropriate meaning for a word that describes a system that moves goods and favors back and forth between participants, sort of a business version of the Golden Rule or, in a different light, the expression \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.\""
  },
  "inquest": {
    "short": "An inquest is when a court of law or a coroner investigates the circumstances of a person's death. If a person in your family dies suddenly, you might attend an inquest at the courthouse.",
    "long": "A death doesn't always require an inquest — they are typically carried out when there is something unexplained or suspicious about the way someone died. The inquest might be a step before a murder investigation, for example. Like a trial, a court inquest typically has a verdict issued by a judge, which might be \"natural death\" or \"accidental death.\" The Old French root word is enqueste, or \"inquiry.\""
  },
  "notch": {
    "short": "A notch is a small cut or nick in something. People make notches to keep track of things.",
    "long": "If you've even seen a little U-shaped or V-shaped cut in something, you've seen a notch. In prison, criminals will make notches on the wall to keep track of how long they've been there. If you're stranded on a desert island, you might make notches on a tree. When you make a notch, you're notching. A notch is also part of a mountain range that is lower than the peaks around it — also called a mountain pass."
  },
  "frivolous": {
    "short": "Frivolous things are silly or unnecessary. If something is frivolous, then you don't need it.",
    "long": "Frivolous things are goofy, useless, or just plain dumb. The word is often used to describe lawsuits. A frivolous lawsuit has no value and will be a waste of the court's time. If someone is frivolous, that person shouldn't be taken seriously because he's always fooling around and never gets anything done. Frivolous is pretty much the opposite of essential."
  },
  "substantiate": {
    "short": "To substantiate is to give support to a claim. We’d really like to believe in the Tooth Fairy; however, more evidence is needed to substantiate her existence (besides that quarter in your pocket).",
    "long": "Substantiate is related to the word substantial, which means \"solid.\" So, to substantiate a claim is to make it solid or believable. If the evidence given in support of an argument is weak and unconvincing, that evidence can be described as insubstantial. Of course, in special cases like the Tooth Fairy, having substantial evidence doesn’t seem to matter; fans just keep on believing."
  },
  "denunciation": {
    "short": "A denunciation is a public reprimand in which you are told that you've done wrong. If you get caught skipping school, expect denunciation — by teachers, your principal, parents and maybe even your friends.",
    "long": "When you harshly criticize someone or something in front of other people, it's a denunciation, like an opinion piece that appears in a newspaper. Sometimes denunciation has the meaning of telling on or exposing someone's misdeeds, like a juicy, book-length denunciation of a famous guitarist written by a former bandmate. The Latin root word is denuntiare, \"to announce, proclaim, denounce, or command.\""
  },
  "burnish": {
    "short": "That seductive gleam on that Porsche behind the dealer's window? It's called a burnish, a gloss only achieved by loads of polishing. Likewise, you can burnish a resume by polishing it until it's perfect.",
    "long": "A caution about usage: burnish in the physical sense is usually reserved for inanimate objects, not people — you usually wouldn't say that someone's appearance is \"burnished to perfection\" or that your freshly scrubbed face is burnished. But you could burnish a car, a suit of armor, or a copper kettle. Reputations are among the most common non-physical things to be burnished."
  },
  "levy": {
    "short": "Use the word levy as you would use the word tax: “When the state government imposed a levy on soft drinks, thousands of citizens took to the streets in protest.”",
    "long": "The word levy can act as either a verb or a noun in a sentence. The noun levy refers to a charge, such as a tax, fine, or other fee, that is imposed on something. The verb levy is used to describe the act of imposing or collecting the charge. If you need to raise money, for example, you may decide to levy a fine on your family every time you have to make the coffee in the morning. (Be careful though: your family may also take to the streets in protest.)"

  "physiological": {
    "short": "Anything physiological has to do with the body and its systems. You might notice that your physiological response to a scary movie includes your heart beating faster and your hands getting sweaty.",
    "long": "You know that the root word of physiological is phys, which refers to the body (think of those phys. ed. classes you panted through). That root comes from the Greek word for nature. Add the suffix ology, which means \"the study of\" (see where we're going?), and finally, tack on that little ical. Ta-taa! You have turned the root into an adjective to describe the way your body works. Let's get physiological!"

  "ascend": {
    "short": "To ascend is to move or travel upwards. You can do this literally, like when you ascend to 35,000 feet after your plane takes off, or figuratively, like when you win the lottery and ascend to a higher social class.",
    "long": "Riding the escalators in the department store is one way to amuse yourself while your parents shop. You can ascend all the way to the 8th floor, and then descend back to the ground floor. Both ascend and descend come from the Latin verb scandere, which means \"to climb.\" It's the prefixes that make all the difference. The a- of ascend makes the word mean \"climb up,\" while the de- of its antonym makes descend mean \"climb down.\""

  "injunction": {
    "short": "If your school begins building a swimming pool on land that does not belong to it, the city might issue an injunction to stop it. An injunction is an official order issued by a judge.",
    "long": "In general injunctions are court ordered settlements or commands. In the United States, judges cannot create laws, but they can require someone to do something or to stop doing something. If you were wrongly fired from a job, a court may issue an injunction to your former employer, requiring him or her to hire you back or pay your back salary."

  "trample": {
    "short": "To trample is to forcefully walk right over something or someone. If you fall down during a footrace, another runner might trample you.",
    "long": "When you trample, you're stomping or stamping: it's the opposite of walking on tippy toes. A dog might trample a flower garden while chasing a ball, and an angry child might deliberately trample her sister's sandcastle, flattening it with her feet. The verb trample comes from tramp, \"walk heavily or stamp,\" which is rooted in the Middle Low German word trampen, \"to tramp, stamp, or press upon.\""

  "chronological": {
    "short": "If you’re making a list of all your teachers in the order you had them, from kindergarten right up to the present, you’re listing them in chronological order. Chronological is the order in which things actually happened.",
    "long": "Chronological doesn’t allow for time traveling or flashbacks. If you’re making a documentary of events leading up to World War II and you start in the early 1900s and end at the outbreak of the war, in 1939, that’s chronological.  Reverse chronological order means giving the most recent event first, and going backwards from there. Chronological includes the useful Greek root khronos, \"time.\""

    "short": "If someone offers you a pill that promises eternal life, don’t take the pill.  It’s a panacea, a remedy that falsely claims to solve every problem ever.",
    "long": "The Greek word pan means “all” (think of a panorama, a view where you can see everywhere).  The Greek word for “cure” is akēs (which looks like the word “aches”).  Those are the roots of panacea, a cure for all aches.  But a panacea doesn’t really cure everything; it just acts like it can.  Use the word to describe an unbelievable solution, like a new law that will make everyone rich, or a robot that does your homework for you."

  "effusion": {
    "short": "An effusion is an explosion of something, usually words, ideas, or emotions.  A popular singer might inspire an effusion of cheers from her devoted fans.",
    "long": "Mozart is known for the effusion of notes he could produce at a moment's notice — and all without erasing. A heated argument can produce an effusion of words from both sides. The volcano's eruption was an effusion of smoke and fire. The verb form of the word is effuse: After the high-school musical, your mother effused about your singing. Her comments were an effusion of praise. Your father, on the other hand, was less effusive — but he did like the dancing."

    "long": "When you don’t show reverence for religion or god, you are impious. The adjective impious is related to the word piety, which means religious reverence. To be impious is to be without piety. Being impious is similar to being blasphemous, but it’s a little more passive to be impious, while blasphemy is more actively insulting. Also, when you act out against tradition or dutifulness, you could be considered impious. If you dodge a military draft, you will likely be considered impious."

  "quiver": {
    "short": "Scaredy cats around the globe know that quivering is a trembling, shaking motion. A cold gust of wind might make you quiver, as would an icy glare from the abominable snowman.",
    "long": "The verb to quiver means to shudder, wobble, or vibrate, often from fear. But the noun quiver? It's actually the carrying case for your arrows, just the kind of thing Robin Hood would have strapped to his back. So imagine one of his arrows sailing through the air, hitting a tree with a hearty whack!, and then quivering there for a few seconds."

  "hapless": {
    "short": "Use the adjective hapless to describe someone unlucky and deserving of pity, like the hapless car buyer who gives in to the fast-talking salesperson.",
    "long": "The word hapless traces all the way back to the Old Norse word happ, meaning “chance, good luck.” Combine this with the suffix -less (“lacking”) and hapless means “unlucky” or “ill-fated.”  A traveler who goes to Moscow and briefly gets lost on the subway? Just a tourist. A traveler who goes to Moscow, accidentally eats food he is allergic to, somehow loses all his money, and by chance gets on a train destined for Mongolia? Definitely hapless."

    "long": "The word mend was originally used as a religious term, meaning to free a person from sin, usually through repentance and good deeds. Mend has come to refer to fixing something that is broken. A mechanic might mend a broken car, or a seamstress might mend a torn dress. The word also frequently relates health and healing. Someone recovering from a long bout of the flu is said to be \"on the mend.\" But as the song goes, \"How can you mend a broken heart?\""

  "anachronism": {
    "short": "An anachronism is something that doesn't fit its time period, like if you say you'll \"dial\" your smartphone.",
    "long": "Anachronism comes from the Greek roots ana- which means \"against\" and chron- which means \"time.\" Together they represent a situation in which something happens that should not because it belongs to another time period. You see anachronisms all the time in the movies — they occur when you see a jet fly over a Civil War battle! Or knights jousting over a maiden during the time of Shakespeare!"

  "malevolent": {
    "short": "If someone is malevolent, they wish evil on others. If you find yourself approaching someone with a malevolent look in her eye, best to run the other way.",
    "long": "Malevolent comes from the Latin word malevolens, which means \"ill-disposed, spiteful\"; its opposite is benevolent, which means \"wishing good things for others.\"  A malevolent person might display satisfaction at someone else's problems. But it's not only individuals who can be malevolent. If you think that television violence influences viewers to violence, you see television as a malevolent force. The stress is on the second syllable: muh-LEV-uh-lent."

    "short": "Illicit means not allowed by law or custom. It's illegal to kill endangered elephants, but many poachers still engage in the Illicit ivory trade.",
    "long": "Illicit usually refers to something that is not morally proper or acceptable. Illicit activities — like smuggling or counterfeiting  —  happen under the radar of the law. Illicit is from Latin illicitus, from the prefix in-, \"not,\" plus licitus, \"lawful.\""

    "long": "Congenital derives from the Latin genus, to beget. Something that is present at one’s begetting, during fetal development, or at birth is congenital. Fetal alcohol syndrome, which develops in fetuses if their mothers are drinking heavily while pregnant, is a congenital disorder. You might also use congenital to describe something seemingly inborn \"a congenital sense of humor,\" or a \"congenital faith.\""

  "foreshadow": {
    "short": "To foreshadow is to predict something or to give a hint of what is to come. Your kid sister's ability to take apart a toaster and put it back together might foreshadow a successful career in electronics.",
    "long": "The verb foreshadow is can mean \"to warn\" and often has a suggestion of something bad to come, though sometimes it's more neutral or shows examples of both good and bad predictions. Dark gray clouds foreshadow a thunderstorm, just as spring showers foreshadow May flowers. What is foreshadowed doesn't always happen, though. A story might not foreshadow a happily-ever-after ending, but then it takes an unexpected twist, and the villain turns out to be a hero."

  "debouch": {
    "short": "When soldiers debouch, they march out of a very narrow space. Troops might debouch out of a long pass between mountains, for example.",
    "long": "When military troops debouch, they march in a long, narrow line — sometimes single file — because of the width of the area they're moving through. As they debouch, the soldiers emerge in a larger area, like an open field. The narrow space is known as a defile in military terminology. The verb debouch has a French root, déboucher, which combines dé, or \"removal,\" and bouche, \"mouth.\""
  },
  "ostentation": {
    "short": "Ostentation is a pretentious or showy display (gaudy or flashy), usually designed to attract attention. Ostentation is a woman in a fur coat, covered in diamond jewelry, boarding a gold-plated private jet.",
    "long": "The noun ostentation stems from the Latin word ostentationem, meaning \"vain display.\" It is often associated with material items that showcase one's wealth and luxury. Ostentation might come to the minds of the other parents if you drive a Lamborghini to drop your kids off at school. A movie star's gas-guzzling, 400-foot yacht may also be considered by many as a symbol of ostentation."
  },
  "intemperate": {
    "short": "If a climate is intemperate, its temperatures might be extreme. If a person is intemperate, his moods might be extreme. Being intemperate is all about avoiding moderation.",
    "long": "Intemperate is a combination of the prefix in- meaning \"not\" and the Latin temperantia meaning \"moderation.\" When you are intemperate, you are not doing things in moderation; you lack self-control. It's often a word used when describing the tendency someone has to indulge excessively in liquor.  An alcoholic is intemperate — overindulging and depending on alcohol."
  },
  "repercussion": {
    "short": "A repercussion is something that happens because of another action. You could quit paying your rent, but getting evicted from your apartment might be the repercussion.",
    "long": "Repercussion may remind you slightly of concussion or percussion — what they all have in common is the idea of something (a head, a drum) getting hit. With repercussion, the hitting is the action, and the result (i.e., the repercussion) is like hearing an echo of that original strike over and over as it reverberates through the air."

    "short": "If something is feasible, then you can do it without too much difficulty. When someone asks \"Is it feasible?\" the person is asking if you'll be able to get something done.",
    "long": "Feasible things are possible. If you have enough time, money, or energy to do something, it's feasible. Something might be feasible at one time and then not feasible at another time. Because of technological advances and competition with the Russians, going to the moon was feasible for the United States in the sixties. Often, people disagree about what's feasible, especially in politics, where how feasible a project is counts for a lot."

  "pitfall": {
    "short": "A pitfall is a trap or difficulty you didn't see. A possible pitfall for high school seniors is not working hard after they know they've already been accepted into college.",
    "long": "In 1300, pitfall referred to an animal trap, such as branches laid across a deep hole offering no escape. Since the 1580s, pitfall has come to describe any hidden or unexpected difficulty, and its meaning has expanded to apply to humans. You might encounter a pitfall when trying to use a brand new computer program that's unexpectedly precise. It can even be a habit you don't want to address, like the pitfalls of snacking in front of the television every night."
  },
  "hoodwink": {
    "short": "To hoodwink someone means to trick or mislead them. Beware of fake ATMs that try to hoodwink you into giving over your bank card and your code, only to keep them both and steal all your money.",
    "long": "An excellent, old-fashioned word is hoodwink, and you’ll be happy you know it when you have to read Victorian novels in which characters are repeatedly hoodwinked. It is an Old English compound which meant \"to blindfold\" 600 years ago but quickly began to be used figuratively. Think about the expression, to pull the wool over someone's eyes, as having the same image and meaning. Has your big sister ever hoodwinked you into doing her chores for her?"
  },
  "irenic": {
    "short": "The adjective irenic describes something that is peaceful. Although you and your sister constantly fought as young children, your relationship might become more irenic as you grow older.",
    "long": "The word irenic is from the Greek word eirēnē, which means peace. Eirene was the Greek goddess of peace. She was one of the Horae, or Hours, and she also represented the season of spring, so she is often depicted holding a full cornucopia. Today, the adjective irenic still maintains its peaceful meaning, and governments are continuously searching for irenic solutions to world problems."
  },
  "bankrupt": {
    "short": "You might not have any money in your pocket, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you are bankrupt. It takes a legal proceeding for the courts to declare a person bankrupt — or officially unable to pay his debts.",
    "long": "Despite the word bank in bankrupt, the word can be used to describe an entity that is short of something other than money. A bankrupt nation might not have the natural resources for its people to produce goods. A nearby country that could easily help but chooses not to may be considered morally bankrupt because of its lack of compassion. Or, maybe there is more to the story. That nation might fear that helping another will bankrupt its own shaky economy. (That is how bankrupt can be used as a verb.)"
  },
  "hegemony": {
    "short": "Hegemony is political or cultural dominance or authority over others. The hegemony of the popular kids over the other students means that they determine what is and is not cool.",
    "long": "Hegemony comes from the Greek hegemon \"leader.\" Wealthy lender nations hoping to determine political outcomes and trade decisions have established hegemony over the debtor nations they lend to. As well as the dominance of one group or nation over others, hegemony is also the term for the leading group or nation itself. During the American Revolution, colonists fought to throw off the British hegemony."
  },
  "forbid": {
    "short": "When you forbid something, you refuse to allow it. You might have heard your parents say things like, \"I forbid you to play ball in the house!\" or \"I forbid you to have any more parties when we're not home!\"",
    "long": "Forbid comes from the Old English word forbeodan, meaning \"forbid, prohibit.\" Forbid can also mean \"prevent\" or \"keep from happening.\" The spare tire on your car will forbid you from driving any faster than 40 miles an hour — any faster and the car will shake. You may have heard forbid used in the expression \"God forbid . . .\" This refers to something you hope will not happen, so much so that you're asking God for a little help."

  "preponderance": {
    "short": "If there's a preponderance of something, there is A LOT of it. If you are a prosecutor, you are looking for a preponderance of evidence to convince the jury that the defendant is guilty.",
    "long": "The noun preponderance can also mean \"superiority in weight or significance.\" This meaning is particularly reflective of the word's Latin roots in the word praeponderare, which means \"outweigh.\" The noun can also mean \"superiority in influence or importance.\" A country's economic preponderance, for example, might give it greater influence in international relations."
  },
  "temple": {
    "short": "A temple is a religious building that's meant for worshipping or praying. Hindu temples are typically devoted to one specific god.",
    "long": "While temples tend to be associated with non-Christian religions like Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism, some sects of Orthodox Christianity worship in temples as well. The Mormon church also calls its sacred structures temples. The word comes from the Latin templum, \"consecrated piece of ground\" or \"building for worship of a god,\" from a Proto-Indo-European root, tem-, \"to cut,\" from the idea of a space cleared or \"cut down\" for an altar."
  },
  "vilify": {
    "short": "To vilify someone is to spread nasty stories about them, whether true or not.",
    "long": "The verb vilify comes from the same root as the word vile and is a negative word if ever there was one! One way to remember the word is to think about how it sounds — like the word villain (which is unrelated and comes from villa). This suggests that when you vilify someone, you make them sound villainous. So avoid spreading vile words that vilify another and make him or her seem like a villain."
  },
  "contentious": {
    "short": "A contentious issue is one that people are likely to argue about, and a contentious person is someone who likes to argue or fight.",
    "long": "Some issues are very controversial. They're also contentious, because people tend to argue about them, and the arguments will probably go on forever. Contentious issues get people angry and in a fighting mood. On the other hand, some people always seem to be in a fighting mood, no matter what the issue is. People like that are contentious too."
  },
  "paradox": {
    "short": "Here's a mind-bender: \"This statement is false.\" If you think it's true, then it must be false, but if you think it's false, it must be true. Now that's a paradox!",
    "long": "A paradox is a logical puzzler that contradicts itself in a baffling way. \"This statement is false\" is a classic example, known to logicians as \"the liar's paradox.\" Paradoxical statements may seem completely self-contradictory, but they can be used to reveal deeper truths. When Oscar Wilde said, \"I can resist anything except temptation,\" he used a paradox to highlight how easily we give in to tempting things while imagining that we can hold firm and resist them."
  },
  "stipulate": {
    "short": "To stipulate something means to demand that it be part of an agreement. So when you make a contract or deal, you can stipulate that a certain condition must be met.",
    "long": "Anytime you draw up a legal agreement, you can stipulate a requirement that has to be met for that agreement to be complete. This stipulation might put some sort of limit on the agreement. For example, if you run a fencing company and offer a sale, you can stipulate that to get the sale price, the fence must be ordered by a certain date. Your customer, in turn, might stipulate that the work must be finished before the ground freezes."
  },
  "rugged": {
    "short": "Terrain that is broken and uneven is called rugged. If you want an easy hike, you should stay away from the rugged coastline. That rocky shoreline is definitely for the more experienced hikers.",
    "long": "The same sense of unevenness applies to other things that are described as rugged. If someone tells a man that he has a rugged face, it's meant to compliment his rough, strong looks. Rugged can also describe something that is steady, sturdy, and strong. Only your rugged constitution will keep you alive in that period of famine between your after school snack and dinner."
  },
  "lachrymose": {
    "short": "A good place to see a display of lachrymose sorrow is at a funeral — people sobbing openly or sniffling quietly into their hankies. To be lachrymose, in other words, is to be tearful.",
    "long": "Lachrymose is not a word used much in everyday speech; you wouldn't say, for example, \"I feel a bit lachrymose today.\" No, you'd probably say, \"I feel a bit weepy today.\" Lachrymose is generally confined to use as a written critical term, often meaning much the same as sentimental. Books and plays and films can all be lachrymose, if their intent is to induce shameless sniveling."
  },
  "homogeneous": {
    "short": "If a group of things are homogeneous, they're all the same or similar, like a room full of identically dressed Elvis impersonators.",
    "long": "The adjective homogeneous comes from the Greek homogenes, meaning “of the same kind.” You can break down the root of the word further into two parts: homos, meaning “same,” and genos, meaning “kind, gender, race, stock.” It sounds very scientific, but if you look around the table at home and everyone is eating a bowl of oatmeal, you could safely describe your family’s breakfast tastes as homogeneous."
  },
  "embrace": {
    "short": "To embrace something is to welcome it with open arms, hold, hug, accept completely. You might embrace your sweetheart, or even changes in technology.",
    "long": "Embrace is from the French verb embrasser, which started out meaning  \"to clasp in the arms\" (but now includes kissing). You embrace someone by giving her a giant hug, and when you embrace a new idea, it's like your brain gives it a hug. The noun and verb form are similar: If you embrace someone who isn't your sweetheart, you might get caught in an embrace. In Henry IV, Shakespeare writes about a really, really tight embrace: \"I will embrace him with a soldier's arm/That he shall shrink under my courtesy.\""

  "nonchalant": {
    "short": "If your friend is acting cool, unconcerned or in an indifferent manner, call him nonchalant — like when he saunters by a group of whispering, giggling girls and just nods and says, \"Hey.\"",
    "long": "If you act nonchalant, you are literally acting cool, as nonchalant traces back to non- \"not\" and Latin calēre \"to be warm.\" Isn't that cool? Sometimes, a nonchalant person acts indifferent or uninterested, but really cares very much. If you give a girl a nonchalant smile, you definitely want her to notice you! Even though it begins with non, nonchalant has no positive form —  chalant is not a word."
  },
  "germane": {
    "short": "Germane means relevant; it fits in. If you are giving a speech on dog training, stick to the germane, canine stuff. Topics that would not be germane? Catnip toys, hamster wheels, and the use of a saddle.",
    "long": "You can thank Shakespeare for the modern meaning of the adjective germane. The word originally referred to people who have the same parents. Shakespeare added the word's figurative meaning of objects being closely related or relevant when he used it in the play Hamlet. You might want to bring up all sorts of complaints during an argument with your best friend, but she says the two of you should only discuss issues that are germane to the current fight."

  "deleterious": {
    "short": "If something is deleterious, it does harm or makes things worse. Smoking has obvious deleterious effects on your health, not to mention your social life.",
    "long": "My parents were worried that their divorce would have a deleterious effect on us kids, but in the end it was less harmful than watching them fight all the time. For most plants, a lack of sunlight has very deleterious consequences, but there are some plants that actually do very well in the dark. It's a wonder, given how well-established the science is, that we continue to do things that are deleterious to the fragile ecosystem. We must be willing to live with the deleterious effects."
  },
  "emollient": {
    "short": "An emollient is a cream or ointment with a thick, gooey texture. When your hands are dry and cracked in the winter, you probably apply an emollient to make them softer.",
    "long": "Emollient comes from a Latin word with the same spelling, which means “to make soft.” The noun form of emollient refers to a substance that makes something soft. However, emollient can also be an adjective used to describe something with a softening or soothing effect. For example, the annoying child on the airplane might be soothed by the emollient sound of the pilot’s voice over the intercom."
  },
  "subsequent": {
    "short": "For something that comes after something else in time or order, choose the adjective subsequent. If the entire class fails an exam, the teacher will hopefully make subsequent ones a little easier.",
    "long": "Subsequent comes from the Latin subsequi \"to follow closely\" and means just that - following or coming after. If you say, \"in 1990 and subsequent years,\" it includes 1990, whereas \"the years subsequent to 1990\" do not include it. When you mention a car crash and subsequent traffic jam or a scandal and subsequent investigation, one follows the other in order but a cause and effect relationship is implied too."
  },
  "crockery": {
    "short": "Dishes — plates, bowls, and cups — are crockery. If you don't have a dishwasher, you'll have to wash all the crockery from your dinner party by hand.",
    "long": "Crockery most often refers to everyday ceramic tableware, rather than fine, expensive china. You'll set the table with crockery when the occasion is too formal for paper plates but not fancy enough for porcelain. The word crockery arose in the eighteenth century from the now-obsolete crocker, or \"potter,\" which in turn came from the Old English croc, \"pot or vessel.\""
  },
  "canine": {
    "short": "Canine is how zoologists refer to all mammals with snouts and non-retractable claws. Sound familiar?  That's right, Fido is a canine. (All dogs are.) Coyotes and wolves are canines, too.",
    "long": "The sharp pointy teeth in your mouth are also called canines.  Like wolves, we use these sharp incisors to tear meat from the bone, though these days we tend to get some help in that department from knives and forks.  Fun fact: The police call their drug-sniffing dogs the K-9 unit. Get it?"
  },
  "covenant": {
    "short": "A covenant is an agreement between two people, or companies, or even countries. It is formal, solemn, sometimes even sacred.",
    "long": "There are some places where you'll hear covenant get used. It's a little old fashioned and formal, but marriage is often referred to as a covenant. The most famous covenant appears in the Bible — God tells a shepherd named Abraham to follow God's instructions in exchange for making Abraham's descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky."
  },
  "aplomb": {
    "short": "Aplomb is the ultimate test for cool: grace under pressure. Use aplomb to show great restraint under even the most trying circumstances. In retail, it's always a good idea to handle the angry customers with aplomb.",
    "long": "Angry at the long lines at the grocery store? Irritated because the driver ahead cut you off? Take a deep breath, and approach life's messes with aplomb. When you think of aplomb, think cool, calm and collected. Not frazzled, furious, and fiery. Aplomb comes from the French word meaning \"perpendicularity,\" from the phrase à plomb for \"poised upright, balanced.\""

  "presage": {
    "short": "A presage is a sign that something bad is about to happen, like when you get that queasy feeling in your stomach because your mom found out you skipped band practice to go to the movies.",
    "long": "Presage, pronounced \"PREH-sige,\" can be a noun or a verb. As a noun, presage is a warning or omen of bad things to come, like a strange quiet and stillness in the air, presage to the coming tornado. As a verb, presage means \"to make a prediction or give a warning of what's to come.\" A terrible end-of-season football game might presage the struggles that the team will face next season."
  },
  "egregious": {
    "short": "Something that is egregious stands out, but not in a good way — it means \"really bad or offensive.\" If you make an egregious error during a championship soccer match, your coach might bench you for the rest of the game.",
    "long": "An egregious error is so bad that it might not be forgivable. Some synonyms are appalling and intolerable. The word has made a 180-degree turn from its original sense in Latin, when it meant \"exceptionally good.\" Word historians have speculated that the negative usage was originally meant to be ironic, but it is the only sense that has survived. Be careful not to use it to mean \"outstanding,\" since no one wants to be called egregious."

    "long": "You can bypass something physically, like when you bypass the busiest intersections in town during rush hour, driving on smaller streets instead. You can also bypass things figuratively: political candidates often bypass hard questions from reporters, and big businesses sometimes find ways to bypass some of the taxes they owe. As a noun, a bypass is either an alternative road or route; or a heart operation that allows blood flow when an artery is blocked."
  },
  "indulgent": {
    "short": "Someone who is self-indulgent gives themselves a lot of treats. Parents who are indulgent cave to every desire their child expresses. Indulgent means lenient, or overly generous.",
    "long": "Indulgent is a word that, here in Puritanical North America, is hard to know how to take. Is it okay to “indulge yourself” as so many spa advertisements suggest? Or is indulgent always associated with excess? You can indulge fantasies of figuring out the answer, or you can give in to an indulgent shrug and move on to another word."
  },
  "antagonistic": {
    "short": "If you're antagonistic, you're hard to get along with. Harmony is not your friend — you prefer hostility and struggle.",
    "long": "If you're antagonistic to your little brother, you're always picking on him and giving him a hard time — causing him agony — a word that's buried in antagonistic. Even drugs or chemicals can be antagonistic: if you take a sleeping pill and then follow it with a few cups of espresso, the interaction is likely to be antagonistic. The sleeping pill and the caffeine struggle against each other and you're not likely to get much sleep."
  },
  "rife": {
    "short": "Use the adjective rife to mean \"full of\" or \"widespread,\" especially when you're talking about something negative. If the lifeguard says the water is rife with jellyfish, you're not going to want to swim in it.",
    "long": "Not to be confused with the word ripe (“fully developed”), rife means “abundant” or “prevalent.” Rife can follow the word it’s describing, as in “corruption was rife during his administration.” More commonly, however, rife comes before the word it modifies, accompanied by the preposition with, as in “the class was rife with yawns” or “her story was rife with inconsistencies.”"
  },
  "typify": {
    "short": "To typify is to represent what is typical of something or someone. You might say that screaming and door slamming typify your spoiled cousin if that kind of behavior is exactly the kind of thing she usually does.",
    "long": "Something that's characteristic of a group of people typifies them. You might observe, for example, that studying late on a Friday night typifies your college friends who are math majors. You could also say that sunny days and cool nights typify autumn in New England, since that's the typical weather for that particular place and time. The root word is Greek — typos, which means \"dent, impression, mark, figure, or original form.\""
  },
  "prompt": {
    "short": "If you're prompt, you're on time. Go ahead and be prompt to class. Also, to prompt is to inspire or make happen. Getting in trouble for being late should prompt you to get a better alarm clock.",
    "long": "The adjective prompt can mean \"as scheduled,\" or simply \"quick.\" When you prompt someone, you motivate them in some way: you might offer a reminder, assistance, or even inspiration to do something. For example, honking your car horn prompts your friend to get moving, and speaking up in defense of your classmate might prompt a bully to change his ways. If a director prompts an actor who's forgotten his lines, she reminds him what comes next."
  },
  "candid": {
    "short": "Straightforward and truthful talk might be described with the adjective candid.  If you're always candid, your parents will know that they can trust you.",
    "long": "A serious-minded politician might suggest engaging in a \"candid discussion\" about a complicated topic like health care or the environment, because candid means \"open\" or \"frank.\" Remember that TV show Candid Camera? It was called that because its hidden cameras supposedly showed a candid view of reality. In photography, candid has become a noun meaning \"an unposed photo.\" The word comes from Latin candidus, meaning \"white,\" which was later extended to mean \"pure.\" Candid talk provides the pure, unvarnished truth."
  },
  "satiate": {
    "short": "If you just can't get enough popcorn, even the jumbo tub at the movie theater may not be enough to satiate, or satisfy, your desire.",
    "long": "Satiate is often used in situations in which a thirst, craving, or need is satisfied. However, when satiate is used to describe eating, it can take on a more negative, or even disgusted, tone. If you comment that the diners at the world's largest all-you-can eat buffet were satiated, you might not mean that they were merely satisfied. You could be implying that they've been gluttons, and that they are now overstuffed with fried chicken wings and mac and cheese."
  },
  "noisome": {
    "short": "If you accidentally leave half a sandwich under your bed for a few days, cover your nose while you sleep because it will probably become quite noisome. This is a fancy way of saying that it will stink.",
    "long": "Despite that first syllable, this adjective doesn’t have root origins in the word noise, but is related to the word annoy. Noisome can refer to anything unpleasant or anything that makes you nauseous. However, it is most often used to describe bad smells. So spray some air freshener, open the windows, and clean out under your bed!"
  },
  "assiduous": {
    "short": "If you call someone assiduous, it's a compliment. It means they're careful, methodical and very persistent. Good detectives are classically assiduous types.",
    "long": "Assiduous comes from two Latin words: assiduus, meaning \"busy incessant, continual or constant,\" and assidere, meaning \"to sit down to\" something. (Funnily enough, we also get the word sedentary, meaning someone who doesn't move around much, a lazy couch potato, from this same last word.) Although we tend to think of sedentary types as being the very opposite of assiduous ones, many assiduous activities (like writing, thinking, or detective work) are best done sitting in a chair."
  },
  "fragmentary": {
    "short": "Anything fragmentary is made up of tiny parts or pieces, and it's usually missing some of them. Archaeologists are always discovering fragmentary remnants of ancient societies which they have to try and piece back together.",
    "long": "Something fragmentary is in fragments, or broken bits. The Latin root is fragmentum, \"a remnant,\" or literally, \"a piece broken off.\" Fragmentary things have been broken or have decomposed, and there's no guarantee that all the pieces can still be found. What will your sister say when she sees the fragmentary remains of that bowl she made in art class?"
  },
  "flag": {
    "short": "A flag is a piece of cloth that represents a country, group, or institution. If you're particularly proud of your Irish heritage, you might fly an Irish flag in your front yard.",
    "long": "A real flag enthusiast might fly the American flag, their state flag, their city's flag, and the flag of their parents' birth countries. There are also flags used for signaling on ships at sea and during races and sporting events, and flags that represent armies or advertise products. When flag is used as a verb, it means \"to lose energy or enthusiasm.\" When students start to flag in the afternoon, they tend to take a quick nap — sitting up at their desks."
  },
  "pummel": {
    "short": "The best pummelers in the world are probably boxers, as to pummel means to repeatedly beat someone down, especially with fists.",
    "long": "The main sense of pummel is physical, but you can use it figuratively when something is taking a beating. During a stock market crash, the economy is being pummeled. A heavy rain can pummel the earth. If you get three bad math grades in a row, it feels like numbers themselves are pummeling you. When many bad things happen at once, it feels like you're being pummeled by life."
  },
  "farcical": {
    "short": "Something that's farcical is ridiculously funny — absurd, even. When you stumbled onstage, tripping over your costume and pulling down the backdrop, you brought a farcical element to the serious play.",
    "long": "If it resembles a farce — a silly comedy that pokes fun at something — you can describe it as farcical, which is pronounced \"FAR-cih-kul.\" Farcical comes from the Latin farcire, \"to stuff,\" which influenced the French farce, a \"comic interlude in a mystery play.\" It's thought that farce came to have this meaning because it was \"stuffed\" in between acts."
  },
  "entailed": {
    "short": "To entail is to involve. A job at a movie theater might entail sweeping popcorn off the floor, probably because watching a movie entails eating popcorn in the dark. It’s a small price to pay!",
    "long": "The word entail, which comes from Latin, is connected to the idea of preconditions. If you want something, you better figure out what it entails. If it’s only 8 o’clock and you want to see a movie at 9, that will entail waiting for an hour. If you want to stay out of trouble, that will entail calling your parents and letting them know you're going to be late. That’s what being responsible entails!"
  },
  "penitent": {
    "short": "Penitent means deeply sorry, ashamed, and full of remorse. If you feel sorry––or just want to appear to––you should adopt a penitent manner.",
    "long": "Penitent comes from the Latin word paenitere, which means to repent. It can be either noun or adjective. Though it's not restricted to them, penitent often pops up in religious contexts, particularly as a noun, as in, \"The penitent threw herself at the bishop's feet and begged forgiveness for her sins.\""
  },
  "traitor": {
    "short": "A traitor says one thing but does another. If you promise a friend you'll keep his secret, but instead you blab it to everyone, you're a traitor.",
    "long": "The word origin says it all: traditorem is the Latin word for \"betrayer.\" Liar? Yes. Backstabber? Yes. True friend? Heavens, no. Traitors betray the trust of those who have faith in them or believe their promises. Traitor also applies to a person who betrays his country by committing treason: turning against his own government, perhaps by selling secret information."
  },
  "venerable": {
    "short": "To be venerable is to be admired and respected because of your status or age. You become venerable by achieving great things or just by living long enough.",
    "long": "The adjective venerable means \"admired\" and \"respected\" — it should describe how you feel about old folks and bosses, for example. It describes the wise old man at the top of the mountain who tells you the meaning of life. As a noun, the Venerable refers to someone high up in a religion, usually Christian. In fact, Saint Bede, who is sometimes called the Father of English History, is often referred to as Bede the Venerable."
  },
  "survive": {
    "short": "To survive something is to live through it or endure it. You can survive a car accident, or you can survive your little brother's four-hour violin recital.",
    "long": "The verb survive is from the Latin word supervivere, “live beyond,” or “live longer than.” Originally to survive was used in the legal context as in “you survive your wife and therefore inherit her kingdom.” However, nowadays you might say that you were able to survive a holiday at your in-laws’, that your brother survived his first round of job interviews, or that you will never survive another all-day trip to the zoo in ninety degree heat."
  },
  "decorate": {
    "short": "Putting up paintings, stringing up lights, and getting some flowers are all ways to decorate a house. When you decorate, you make things look better or at least more interesting.",
    "long": "Even an attractively furnished home can be decorated for a holiday or party. That means you dress up your house to celebrate the special occasion. Decorate is also used to describe certain kinds of success. A famous athlete might decorate a gym with trophies and championship rings. We say a person in the military, like a general, is decorated when he or she is given medals for bravery or other accomplishments."
  },
  "amendment": {
    "short": "An amendment is a change made to an original, usually a document or statement. You might propose an amendment to your environmental club's bylaws requiring that all official club documents be printed on recycled paper.",
    "long": "Can you spot the word amend, meaning \"to make better\" or \"to cure of faults and errors,\" hidden in amendment? If so, you'll grasp the notion that an amendment is something intended to improve whatever preceded it. It pops up most often in formal legal contexts, where it refers to a written change to a bill, law, contract, or the U.S. Constitution."
  },
  "lugubrious": {
    "short": "Funerals are lugubrious. So are rainy days and Mondays. Anything that makes you sad, gloomy, or mournful can be called lugubrious.",
    "long": "Lugubrious comes from the Latin verb lūgēre, \"to mourn.\" You can also listen to the sound of the word: lugubrious sounds slow, heavy, and sad. Sometimes, just the \"feel\" of a word is enough to clue you in to its meaning, and lugubrious is one of those words. I was feeling great when I got to the concert, but the lugubrious music left me in a terrible mood."
  },
  "allure": {
    "short": "Something that has allure is powerfully attractive and tempting. A career in Hollywood might have great allure to a teenager who loves acting.",
    "long": "You've probably noticed that allure contains lure, from the German word luder meaning \"bait.\" A well-made lure is so alluring to a fish that it won't notice the hook. First used in the 15th century, this word has even landed its own fashion magazine — Allure, which tries to tempt people to buy it by putting powerfully attractive people on the cover and hoping you'll believe that if you buy it, you'll have some allure as well."
  },
  "barren": {
    "short": "Drive through a forest that's just been destroyed by a fire, and you'll get an idea of what barren means — stripped of vegetation and devoid of life.",
    "long": "Not to be confused with a baron, a kind of nobleman, barren is often used to describe an area of land that lacks any signs of life. A barren wilderness is dry and empty, with no foliage or twittering birds to be found. An old-fashioned and unflattering word for a woman who is unable to have children is barren."
  },
  "menacing": {
    "short": "Something that is menacing is threatening or suggestive of coming danger. If you’re backing away slowly from something, you can probably use the adjective menacing to describe it!",
    "long": "Menacing means “threatening” — whether it’s on purpose or not. A menacing tone is intended to scare you, but that menacing raincloud isn’t actually trying to ruin your day. Menacing can describe the behavior of a menace, but only the mean or dangerous kind — not just a pest: \"The raccoon that always knocks over your garbage can is a menace, but it's not menacing (unless it also chases you around your house).\""
  },
  "devoid": {
    "short": "You're stranded in the ocean, miles from shore, clinging to a sinking boat, and you can't swim? Sorry to say, your situation is devoid of all hope.",
    "long": "When you fall off a cliff, you fall into the void. Void means \"empty.\" Devoid means \"empty of.\" Always answer the question \"Of what?\" when you use it: \"My wallet is devoid of cash. My teacher is devoid of pity. My cookie jar is devoid of cookies.\" These examples are devoid of anything not totally depressing!"
  },
  "recognize": {
    "short": "When, at a meeting, you wave your hand wildly, you want to be recognized.  When the chairperson finally says, “I recognize the man who is about to fall out of his seat,” don't forget what you wanted to say.",
    "long": "The verb recognize comes from the Latin root words re (again) and cognoscere (to know) – literally “to know again” or “to identify.”  If your own identical twin doesn't recognize you, you might be wearing too much makeup.  Recognize can also mean “to acknowledge” or “to appreciate.”  When you recognize the donors for their generous contributions to your fundraising event, your parents say, “You're welcome.”"
  },
  "odoriferous": {
    "short": "Something that's odoriferous carries a smell. When you hear someone use the word odoriferous, just hope they're not referring to your breath or armpits.",
    "long": "Odoriferous is made up of the word odor, meaning smell and the Latin ferre meaning \"to carry.\" Something that's odoriferous certainly carries a smell whether it's onions or roses or a pile of dog poop. Odoriferous has a less well-known second meaning; something that does not take your morals into consideration can also be odoriferous, or morally offensive.  Many people consider animal testing odoriferous because of the harm it does to animals. They might call it odoriferous, or they might say it just plain stinks."
  },
  "vacuous": {
    "short": "Reserved for the harmlessly stupid and truly meaningless, vacuous is a smart-sounding way to describe something dumb. Celebrity gossip and reality TV are usually pretty vacuous, even if they're fun.",
    "long": "If someone smiles at you in a way that seems fake or empty, you could describe the smile as vacuous.  An example of a vacuous comment would be a politician promising to make things better without explaining how.  If something is vacuous, it's like a vacuum — hollow, empty, devoid of substance."
  },
  "tangential": {
    "short": "Tangential describes something that's not part of the whole. If you make a comment that is tangential to the story you're telling, it's a digression. The story could still be understood without it.",
    "long": "In geometry, a tangent is a line that touches a curve in one spot but doesn't intersect it anywhere else. Tangential means something that goes off in one direction that way and doesn't return. People can feel tangential — as though they're inessential and not relevant to a larger group."
  },
  "illustrative": {
    "short": "A fight with your brother over who ate the most food may be illustrative of your competitive relationship with him. Something illustrative means it is a telling example of something else.",
    "long": "Within this word, you see illustrate which means to make something clear by using pictures or examples. Something is illustrative when it paints a perfect picture of a subject. If you're trying to describe something, an illustrative example might make it easier for your audience to understand what you mean. The tidiness of your sock drawer might be illustrative of your compulsive (or messy) nature."
  },
  "ruefully": {
    "short": "When you do something in a way that expresses regret, you’re doing it ruefully. If someone asks you about your Saturday night and you smile ruefully in response . . . well . . . you probably made some poor choices.",
    "long": "The origin of the word ruefully is a Germanic word that means “repentance.” But over time the word has adopted a slightly humorous tone, so you can go ahead and shake your head ruefully at your friend who has just put his boot on the wrong foot — you feel a little bit sorry for him at the moment. You might grin ruefully when asked about how many pairs of shoes you bought on your trip."
  },
  "coddle": {
    "short": "While it is okay for parents to coddle, spoil, or pamper a young child, it’s a little unnerving when parents coddle, or pamper adult children. And downright weird when adult children wear Pampers.",
    "long": "Coddle is an old word. Originally, it meant to cook gently in water that is near boiling, as in coddling an egg. It most likely gained its association with pampering and taking care of someone via a drink made for invalids that was prepared by coddling. “Mollycoddle,” a synonym for coddle, originally meant a person who coddles himself, or an effeminate man."
  },
  "amenity": {
    "short": "Like built-in GPS, seat warmers and four-wheel drive, an amenity is a feature that contributes to comfort or value. Or in another sense, it's the overall pleasantness that results from all those cool features.",
    "long": "Declared the American novelist Edith Wharton, “I despair of the Republic! Such dreariness, such whining sallow women, such utter absence of the amenities, such crass food, crass manners, crass landscape! What a horror it is for a whole nation to be developing without the sense of beauty, and eating bananas for breakfast.” As you can see, people throughout time have gotten cranky when they’ve felt their amenities to be lacking."
  },
  "jamb": {
    "short": "A jamb is one of the upright boards or posts that support a door or window frame. Your front door shuts securely in between two jambs.",
    "long": "When a house builder frames a doorway, she sets two jambs at the sides of the opening, with what's called a lintel at the top. The door fits between the jambs. Windows have jambs too — if you replace your existing windows, you may need a whole new frame, including new jambs. The Old French origin is jambe, which means \"pier or side post,\" but was originally \"a leg or a shank,\" from the Late Latin gamba, \"leg.\""
  },
  "overhaul": {
    "short": "To overhaul is to completely renovate, making major changes in order to repair. A few shutters and a new coat of paint won't come close to fixing that old, boarded-up house — it needs a complete overhaul.",
    "long": "Back in the 1620s when the word was coined, overhaul described examining a fishing net to make sure there were no tears or big holes that would keep the fisherman from getting a big haul, or large amount of fish. Today, an overhaul is usually the result of such a close examination — like the overhaul that some people want to make to American public schools, or the overhaul an old car needs to keep it on the road."
  },
  "atone": {
    "short": "To atone is to do something \"right\" to make up for doing something wrong. Religious believers are known to atone for their sins, but even students can atone for a past failure by acing a quiz or two.",
    "long": "The word atone came to English as a contraction of the words at and one. The verb means to make amends or reparations for an offense or wrong doing. You can remember the meaning by thinking of it as a sort of Zen concept, to be \"at one\" or in harmony with someone, you have to atone for your mistakes and be forgiven. In a religious sense, it means to repent for sins (\"to atone for his sins\")."
  },
  "adversary": {
    "short": "An adversary is an enemy or someone who opposes someone else. In tennis, you stand across the net from your adversary.",
    "long": "Adversary is related to the word adverse, meaning \"against or contrary\" —so think of an adversary as someone whom you are fighting against. If you're the undefeated chess champion, you have bested every single one of your adversaries. The word adversary is from Middle English adversarie, from Latin adversarius, from adversus \"against.\""
  },
  "normative": {
    "short": "Something pertaining to norms — something normal or typical — can be described as normative. Temper tantrums, whining, and even hitting are all normative behaviors — if you're three. If you're thirty, you might have a problem.",
    "long": "The adjective normative can also mean prescribing rules or standards. The U.S. government's normative rules for living in American society mean that you have freedom of speech, for example, but you don't have the right to slander or libel someone. The words \"norm\" and \"normal\" are related to normative, which comes from the French normatif, which itself is from the Latin word norma, \"a carpenter's square.\""
  },
  "conscientious": {
    "short": "If someone is conscientious, that person strives to do what's right and to carry out her duties. Conscientious people show care and put in a big effort.",
    "long": "Being conscientious has to do with being careful, thoughtful, and decent. A conscientious doctor will do everything possible to help a patient. A conscientious teacher will spend extra time with students, just to make sure they're learning. A boss wishes every worker could be conscientious: it's a rare and wonderful trait. To be conscientious, you have to be willing to do the right thing even when it's difficult. Unfortunately, many people aren't conscientious."
  },
  "vapid": {
    "short": "Reserve the adjective vapid for the airhead in your office who brings nothing to the table, except maybe the doughnuts. Vapid is an adjective to describe someone or something that is dull or uninspiring.",
    "long": "\"We prefer not to consider the shockingly vapid and primitive comments uttered by athletes in postcontest interviews,\" David Foster Wallace wrote. The word was originally used in English in a much more literal sense, describing beverages that lacked flavor. It comes from the Latin word vapidus, literally \"having exhaled its vapor.\""
  },
  "epistle": {
    "short": "An epistle is a long, formal letter. Several books of the Bible consist of epistles.",
    "long": "If you're used to emails and text messages, you might be surprised by the idea of the epistle — a letter that is very long and also very formal. An epistle isn't something you dash off in a few minutes while waiting for the bus. Epistles take time and thought to write, almost like doing a research paper. The Bible is full of many epistles — that's where many people have seen this word."
  },
  "modulate": {
    "short": "Is your friend's voice so high-pitched that people are starting to stare? Sweetly ask, \"Can you modulate your voice, please? To modulate is to change the pitch of something.",
    "long": "You can modulate things other than sound — it still refers to something that's being adjusted. Schools might modulate the number of students in the hallways at the same time by having each grade level start and end each at a different time. Traffic lights can modulate the number of cars that pass through an intersection in a certain interval. Computer modems modulate signals to allow computers to transfer information. In fact, modem gets its name from modulate/demodulate."
  },
  "libertine": {
    "short": "If you drink a lot, eat a lot, and live a wild and unrestrained life, you might be called a  libertine.",
    "long": "A libertine is someone who lives life unencumbered by morals. Although it can be used neutrally, often if someone calls you a libertine, they disapprove of your lack of morality. In the 14th century, a libertine was \"a freed slave,\" from the Latin liber, \"free.\" Starting in the mid-1500s, libertine had a religious and political connotation, referring to a group that opposed Calvinism. By the nineteenth century, the word became strongly associated with immorality and debauchery."
  },
  "mandate": {
    "short": "A mandate is an official command or a go-ahead. When a politician wins an election by a wide margin, that's a mandate to implement her ideas.",
    "long": "A mandate gives authority. If the government gives schools a mandate to test more, then the schools had better give more tests. People who work for the Peace Corps have a mandate to help various countries with things like getting clean drinking water. A politician who believes in higher taxes and then gets elected considers that a mandate to raise taxes. When you have a mandate, it's like a ticket to get something done."
  },
  "ambiguous": {
    "short": "Look to the adjective ambiguous when you need to describe something that's open to more than one interpretation, like the headline \"Squad helps dog bite victim.\"",
    "long": "Newspaper headlines can be unintentionally funny when they're ambiguous. In \"Squad helps dog bite victim,\" is the squad helping a victim of a dog bite or helping a dog bite a victim?  The ambi- prefix means \"both ways,\" while the guous part is from the Latin verb agere, \"to lead or drive.\" Thus an ambiguous sentence or situation drives us in two different directions at once. The accent is on the second syllable, \"big,\" which you can remember since something that's ambiguous can lead to big misunderstandings."
  },
  "disinclination": {
    "short": "If anyone has ever told you to do something you didn’t want to do, you’ve felt a disinclination, a doubt about participating. Having a disinclination means you’re just not into it, so you hesitate.",
    "long": "In Herman Melville’s short novel “Bartleby, the Scrivener,” when anyone asks Bartleby for a favor, he always replies, “I would prefer not to.” That’s an example of a disinclination — the feeling that there are other things you’d rather be doing. If someone tells you to eat a lightbulb, you might feel a disinclination to do that, and for good reason. The Latin roots of the word roughly translate to “unable to bend,” which describes your unwilling disinclination quite well."
  },
  "sumptuous": {
    "short": "Sumptuous could be used to describe a room appointed with the finest furniture, a lush orchestra playing a beautiful symphony, or a meal meant for a king. Sumptuous describes something that costs a lot and imparts sensory pleasure.",
    "long": "Sumptuous comes from the Latin sumptus, which means \"expensive.\" Sumptus is related to sumere, which means \"to consume.\" The word sumptuous carries both meanings with it. It is a pricey, luxurious thing that's meant to be consumed or enjoyed. You wouldn't use sumptuous to describe a tractor, even if it has leather seats."
  },
  "asteroid": {
    "short": "An asteroid is a large, irregularly shaped object in space that orbits our Sun. If one of these giant rocks ends up on a collision course with Earth, we are in for big trouble.",
    "long": "An asteroid is like a comet. However, while comets are mostly made of ice, asteroids are made up of rock or even metal. This makes them dangerous because they can cause a lot of damage if they collide with a planet. The craters on the Moon were formed by asteroids and some think it was an asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. Around a million asteroids are located between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the “asteroid belt.”"
  },
  "arduous": {
    "short": "Use the adjective arduous to describe an activity that takes a lot of effort. Writing all those college essays and filling out the applications is an arduous process!",
    "long": "Arduous was first used in English to mean \"steep\" or \"difficult to climb.\" If you're an outdoorsman, hiking up a mountain is a lot of fun, but if you're a couch potato, it's an arduous trek. Today, the word can be used figuratively for something that is difficult or takes a lot of work. If you spend an arduous week studying for your final exams, you'll do well because you've worked really hard!"
  },
  "anticipate": {
    "short": "To anticipate something is to be expecting it. Your dog might be waiting by the door, anticipating his next walk or squirrel chase.",
    "long": "\"Anticipating something\" also often implies that you are preparing to take some action because of your expectations — like when you anticipate your chess opponent's next move and plan a counterattack. The word anticipate can also mean \"to come beforehand\" — as in a certain musical trend anticipating another."
  },
  "zealous": {
    "short": "Use the adjective zealous as a way to describe eagerness or enthusiastic activity. If you are too zealous in your efforts to decorate the house with Christmas lights, you might cause a power outage for the whole neighborhood.",
    "long": "Zealous is the adjective for the noun zeal, \"eager partisanship\"; the latter has a long e, but zealous has a short one: ZEL-uhs. It can have a slightly negative connotation, and people are sometimes described as overzealous, meaning they try too hard. Zealous rhymes with jealous (and in fact they both derive from the same Greek word), but don't confuse them: a jealous person might be resentful of someone who makes zealous efforts to achieve success."

  "pantomime": {
    "short": "If you make a motion with your hands to indicate eating ice cream, you are using pantomime. Parents often use this wordless communication to try to keep things from the kids. Unfortunately, the kids usually catch on quickly — especially if there is ice cream involved.",
    "long": "An entire show, done without words is often called a pantomime, but around December, you may read about a Christmas pantomime. This is a traditional holiday show in the United Kingdom. The play is usually based on a fairy tale, and it is put on especially for children. Although it is called a pantomime or panto, the show actually includes talking, jokes, and music. The tradition goes back to the 1700s and is still popular today."
  },
  "apt": {
    "short": "Something apt is perfectly appropriate, clever and well-suited to the matter at hand. If your room is small and dark, “cave-like” would be an apt description.",
    "long": "The wee cousin of aptitude, apt has the same root meaning of \"strength and ideal appropriateness.\" An apt description or nickname is one that’s just right. Apt can also be used in the form \"to be apt to\" meaning \"to be likely to\" do something. You’re apt to use this word more now that you know precisely what it means!"
  },
  "dampen": {
    "short": "To dampen something is to stifle it, to lessen its effect, or to moisten it. Getting a cold will dampen your enthusiasm.",
    "long": "This word has several related meanings, most of which make something less effective or powerful. Using a towel will dampen it in the sense of getting it wet, but dampening goes beyond things that are damp (wet). Bad news will dampen your mood, bringing it down. Boxing gloves dampen the force of punches because they cushion the blows. Anything dampened has been weakened and brought down a notch."
  },
  "repertoire": {
    "short": "Repertoire refers to the full supply of what you can do. A singer's repertoire is all the songs he can sing. A chef's repertoire is what she knows how to cook.",
    "long": "Repertoire was borrowed from French répertoire, from Late Latin repertorium \"an inventory.\" The Late Latin word is also the source of English repertory, a group of actors that perform many plays, each performed for a short time. The second \"r\" in both repertoire and repertory is often not pronounced."
  },
  "mired": {
    "short": "When you're mired in something, you're stuck or entangled in it. You can't get out.",
    "long": "Sometimes, being mired means to be literally trapped in the mire, which is like a swamp or muck. But usually when people are mired, it's in something less icky but equally hard to get out of. You could be mired in six hours of homework. Congress could be mired in discussions that are going nowhere. A bad relationship could be mired in arguments. When you're mired, it feels like you're sinking in quicksand."
  },
  "suffrage": {
    "short": "Suffrage is the right to vote in public elections. Universal suffrage means everyone gets to vote, as opposed to only men or property holders. Suffrage has nothing to do with \"suffering\" — unless the wrong person is elected.",
    "long": "If you want to vote before you’re 18, fight for youth suffrage and get the law changed. In the meantime, once you turn 18, go vote! Kids grow up, of course, but it has been much harder for others to get the right to vote. For example, after trying for about a hundred years, American women were granted suffrage and voted for the first time in 1920. Think about that next time you’re tempted to stay home on election day."
  },
  "disparity": {
    "short": "If there is a disparity between how great you think you are at tennis and how you actually play, you are probably surprised by how often you lose. Disparity is the condition of being unequal, and a disparity is a noticeable difference.",
    "long": "Disparity usually refers to a difference that is unfair: economic disparities exist among ethnic groups, there is a disparity between what men and women earn in the same job. This noun derives from Latin dispar \"unequal.\" The opposite of disparity is parity, the condition of being equal or the same."
  },
  "strident": {
    "short": "Something that's strident is loud, grating, and obnoxious. Your roommate's strident laughter as he watches cartoons late into the night might inspire you to buy a pair of ear plugs.",
    "long": "Strident is related to the Latin word strix , meaning \"screech owl.\" This is a kind of owl that doesn't hoot. It screeches in a strident way. Strident can also describe the forceful expression of an unpopular opinion. Don't confuse strident with striding, which means walking quickly with a wide step. If you're angry at your brother, you might come striding into his room and begin making a strident case for why he has done you wrong."
  },
  "devious": {
    "short": "Devious describes someone who tends to lie and to trick other people. Devious credit card companies lure younger and younger people into debt with offers of low interest rates and even just free t-shirts.",
    "long": "Devious sometimes just describes a path that is not direct, a meaning that can be traced to the Latin adjective devius, \"out of the way,\" formed from the prefix de-, \"off\" plus via, \"way, road.\" The related English verb deviate means to do something different or unexpected, and the adjective deviant describes behavior that is not considered normal or morally correct."
  },
  "admire": {
    "short": "If you hold someone in high esteem or look up to someone, you admire that person. If you ask four-year-olds who they most admire, they are likely to list their mom, dad, and grandparents — or superheroes and comic book characters.",
    "long": "The verb admire also means to look at with wonder and pleasure. She stood on the balcony of her hotel for a long time, simply to admire the view of the ocean and the surf as it crashed against the rocks below. I admire the way she volunteers to help at the school and with other charities because she is willing to give her time to good causes."
  },
  "knell": {
    "short": "A knell is a ringing sound, particularly from a bell tolled to announce a death or the end of something. Which is kind of depressing.",
    "long": "From the Old English cnyll, meaning “sound made by a bell when struck or rung slowly,” comes our modern day knell. It certainly describes the slow, ominous sound of funeral bells, but isn't always used so literally: We often say that a final blow or action that will bring an end to something sounds or signals the death knell. And if you hear a bell knell in your dreams, look out — superstition says that's not a good sign."
  },
  "animosity": {
    "short": "Animosity is hatred. If your (supposed) best buddy embarrasses you in front of a big crowd, your friendship could turn into animosity.",
    "long": "Animosity comes from the Latin word animus, meaning \"spirit\" or \"mind.\" That's also the root of the word animated — literally, \"full of spirit.\" So how did animosity get so negative? Over the centuries, the original meaning of \"high spirits\" soured into \"hatred.\" Today we most often speak of animosity toward, between, among, or against people. Keeping your animosity in check might make steam come out your ears."
  },
  "insular": {
    "short": "Insular means \"having a narrow view of the world,\" like insular people who never leave their small town, which enables them to believe that every place in the world is the same and the people are all just like them.",
    "long": "The adjective insular comes from the Latin word insula, which means “island.” Perhaps less so in our current age of technological and relatively easy travel, island life can still be separated from the rest. That's why insular can mean \"isolated from,\" like if you grew up in a big city then visited a rural place, you may be surprised that stores close early. Such an experience will help you expand your insular views."
  },
  "convulsion": {
    "short": "If you see someone have a convulsion, it can either be scary or funny, depending on whether it's caused by a medical condition or a really funny joke. A convulsion is a jerking, uncontrolled movement.",
    "long": "When a person has a convulsion, it appears as a sudden, violent movement of the body. Convulsions most often happen as a result of a medical condition or illness like epilepsy, but you can also describe a jerky, irregular movement as a convulsion, even if it's caused by hiccups or laughter. A political upheaval or social turmoil can also be called a convulsion, if it's abrupt and violent. The Latin root word is convulsionem, which means \"to tear loose.\""

    "long": "If you delude someone into thinking something, you are making a fool of them, or making them foolish. The word shares a root with ludicrous which means completely ridiculous. The thing that you foolishly believe is a delusion. Someone with delusions of grandeur has deluded themselves into thinking they are very, very special."
  },
  "skeptic": {
    "short": "A skeptic is a person who doesn't believe something is true unless they see evidence. As a skeptic, you refuse to believe your sister saw a ghost — after all, she can't prove it.",
    "long": "Skeptics are doubters — they need to see proof before they will believe. If you're a skeptic, you're probably dubious about things like astrology and magic. Some skeptics feel the same way about religion, preferring facts that can be scientifically and historically proven. Coming from the Greek word skeptikos, which means \"thoughtful or inquiring,\" it's no surprise that a skeptic is someone who asks a lot of questions — and isn't easily convinced."
  },
  "sanctimonious": {
    "short": "The sanctimonious person sounds like a hypocrite when he preaches to a friend about the evils of drugs, while he drinks one beer after another.",
    "long": "Sanctimonious is a twist on the words sanctity and sacred, which mean holy or religious. A sanctimonious person might think he's holy, but their attitude comes across more like \"holier-than-thou.\" Though sanctimonious people might try to act like saints, their actions are far from pure or holy, which just makes them sound like hypocrites."
  },
  "clamber": {
    "short": "To clamber is to climb awkwardly. Hamlet's Ophelia was said to have been clambering on a weak branch of a willow when she met her \"muddy death.\" It's never a good idea to clamber, let alone on weak willow branches.",
    "long": "We associate the word clamber far more often with toddlers (than Shakespearean tragedy). Toddlers are known for naturally clumsy, ill-coordinated movements we deem cute not foolish. Suitably enough, the word comes from the delightful and long obsolete Middle English word clamb, meaning the past tense of climb, a word that has all the happy logic of a toddler's imagination."
  },
  "pastiche": {
    "short": "The next time you see a movie that you think is a cheap imitation of an older, better movie, you can sound like a film critic by dismissing the picture as a thoughtless pastiche.",
    "long": "A pastiche is an artwork that copies the style of another work or that combines various, distinct styles together into one work. A pastiche can also be a musical medley, or the piecing together of various songs. Pastiche comes from the Italian word pasticcio, which can refer to a pie containing a mix of ingredients, such as meat and pasta."
  },
  "striate": {
    "short": "If a field is plowed into furrows, it's striated — or, technically, it's marked with striae, which are stripes or grooves.",
    "long": "When you see striate, think of stripes. When a child uses a fork to make a row of stripes in her play-dough, she's striating it. A striated rock surface might show evidence of the movement of glaciers thousands of years ago. Striated muscle has a striped appearance."
  },
  "anoint": {
    "short": "To anoint means to choose by divine intervention. Or at least it seems like the big guy upstairs had something to do with it.",
    "long": "Saints and religious leaders are said to be anointed, but so is that new unstoppable quarterback who saved the team midseason. Anoint comes to us from the ancient Latin word unguere, which means \"to smear.\" Which explains the other sense of this word, which is to apply with oil or another smearable substance, such as during a religious ceremony."
  },
  "preserve": {
    "short": "When you preserve something, you maintain its condition, like trying to preserve your good health by exercising regularly and eating right.",
    "long": "The verb preserve describes keeping something as it is now, without a decline in quality. It can also refer to keeping something safe from harm, as in “The group worked hard to preserve the regional ecosystem.” When you preserve food, such as fruit, you keep it from rotting. Jellies and jams are preserves, the noun form. A preserve can also be lands set aside, or preserved, as animal habitats."
  },
  "corn": {
    "short": "Corn is a plant that grows long ears of kernels on tall, grass-like stalks. Many large farms grow fields of corn each year, for human or animals to eat, or to make corn-based products.",
    "long": "Corn is an important crop in North America, since many animals raised for meat eat corn, not to mention the corn that people consume. In addition, products like high fructose corn syrup and ethanol fuel are made from corn. Many people also love to eat corn on the cob slathered with butter in the summer time. In many parts of the world, it's called maize instead of corn, which is an Old English word meaning \"grain.\""
  },
  "deprive": {
    "short": "Deprive means to keep from having. If your little brother gets loud and hyper every time he eats sweets, your parents might deprive him of sugary cereal and candy.",
    "long": "Deprive can also mean to take away something that someone already had, or feels they deserve to have, like basic human rights. \"A crowd gathered to protest the man's imprisonment for a crime he did not commit; they didn't want to allow the government to deprive him of his freedom.\" The word comes from the Latin, de\", which means \"entirely,\" and privare, which means \"release from.\" Put together, they mean to \"entirely release from.\" In this case, the imprisoned man's freedom is being \"entirely released,\" or taken away, and he'll no longer have it."
  },
  "querulous": {
    "short": "Querulous means “having a tendency to complain” or, more directly put, “whiny.” Sure, no one can be happy all the time, but that’s no excuse for being querulous.",
    "long": "Querulous may remind you of the word query, which means “question.” However, the two words are not closely related. It’s perfectly reasonable to make a query; just don’t be querulous if you don’t like the answer you get. Querulous does share its origins with the word quarrel, which means “argument” — and that’s what’s likely to happen if you complain too much."
  },
  "arrogate": {
    "short": "To arrogate is to take over. When the teacher steps out of the classroom and some bossy student marches up to the front of the class and begins scolding the other kids? The student is trying to arrogate the teacher's authority.",
    "long": "When someone takes control of something, often without permission, such as when a military general assumes the power of a country's government after getting rid of the previous leader, they arrogate power or control to themselves. Occasionally the verb arrogate means something like \"assert one's right to,\" or take something that is deserved, but more often it implies a taking by force."
  },
  "demonstrable": {
    "short": "If you can demonstrate to me how something works, then it must be demonstrable. You might think that word should be \"demonstratable,\" but you'd be wrong — that word doesn't exist.",
    "long": "Who can say why some words change a little when we change their part of speech. They just do. The verb demonstrate means to show or instruct. The adjective shortens the root to become demonstrable. The steps for buckling a seatbelt must be easily demonstrable, or people will go flying all over the cabin. Demonstrable is often used to refer to the truth of something: if something isn't demonstrable, then we can't really say that it exists, can we?"
  },
  "lucrative": {
    "short": "Use lucrative to refer to a business or investment that makes money. While your parents might want you to pursue a lucrative career, you're committed to your plan of becoming a professional mime.",
    "long": "This adjective is from the Latin word lucrum, meaning \"profit.\" In Latin, lucrum also meant \"greed,\" a negative sense preserved in the English phrase filthy lucre, or \"shameful profit or gain.\" But the word lucrative doesn't carry a similar sense of shame — if your lawn-mowing job proves lucrative over the summer, you might be able to buy yourself a used car."
  },
  "spontaneous": {
    "short": "Something spontaneous happens when you're least expecting it. Spontaneous things are natural or instinctive, and they happen without warning.",
    "long": "If you plan to go to a movie and then you go, that's not a spontaneous thing. Ditching the movie at the last minute to go to the park? That's spontaneous. Spontaneous things happen all of a sudden, on the spur of the moment, without being planned. Spontaneous can also refer to things that happen without outside influence. Your parents will be happy if you do your chores spontaneously instead of waiting till they nag you."
  },
  "garrulous": {
    "short": "A garrulous person just won’t stop talking (and talking, and talking, and talking...).",
    "long": "Garrulous comes from the Latin word garrire for \"chattering or prattling.\" If someone is garrulous, he doesn't just like to talk; he indulges in talking for talking’s sake — whether or not there’s a real conversation going on. If you discover that you have a garrulous neighbor sitting next to you on the plane, you might just want to feign sleep, unless you really want to hear everything going through his mind for the entire trip."
  },
  "exhortation": {
    "short": "When you were little, heading out the door on a freezing cold day, your mom probably made an exhortation to put on your hat and zip your coat up all the way. An exhortation is a loud or enthusiastic urging.",
    "long": "Use an exhortation any time you really want to encourage someone to do something. It's a way of communicating that's persuasive and powerful — an exhortation might come from a government in the form of a speech encouraging people to get flu shots, or it might be a teacher urging his students to sit quietly. Whether it comes in the form of a warning or encouragement, an exhortation strongly advises people to take some particular action."
  },
  "infiltrate": {
    "short": "If you infiltrate a group or organization, you join it in order to gain information, like an employee of a donut shop that infiltrates the competition to try to learn its \"secret recipe\" for its delicious dough.",
    "long": "Infiltrate is a verb that is familiar to international spies and undercover agents, who are all adept at joining a group under false pretenses, fitting in, and working their way up to the highest ranks in order to find out as much information as they can about the group. The word can be used more broadly to describe anything that stealthily becomes a part of something else, such as slang words that infiltrate our everyday speech."

  "impasse": {
    "short": "When two huge semi trailers met face-to-face on a one-lane mountain road, the drivers jumped out of their cabs and exclaimed, \"We're at an impasse! We can't move forward — we can only reverse and go back in the direction from which we came.\"",
    "long": "If you investigate impasse a little more closely, you'll discover passer, the French word for to pass. The im- prefix is a negative, meaning that there's no way any passing is going to occur. It's impossible. An impasse is any situation in which the parties involved can't, or won't, move forward or make any sort of progress. Either they are literally stuck, like two big trucks trying to pass each other on a narrow road, or they are figuratively stuck, as in two politicians who are unable to reach an agreement on a new policy."
  },
  "exude": {
    "short": "To exude is to give off small amounts, usually of liquids or gases, through small openings, such as pores. Think of how you exude sweat after a workout.",
    "long": "The word exude is often used to describe sweating — the original Latin root, sudāre means \"to sweat.\" Still, we frequently use the word exude to refer to anything that seems to ooze or pour forth from an object or person. John F. Kennedy was said to exude confidence, while his wife, Jackie, exuded class. But the verb can also have a negative sense, as when we say a skunk exudes a foul smell."
  },
  "corroborate": {
    "short": "To corroborate is to back someone else’s story. If you swear to your teacher that you didn't throw the spitball, and your friends corroborate your story by promising that you were concentrating on math homework, she might actually believe you.",
    "long": "For example, a witness in court corroborates the testimony of others, and further experimentation  can corroborate a scientific theory. Near synonyms are substantiate and confirm. Corroborate, originally meaning \"to support or strengthen,\" was borrowed from Latin corrōborāre, formed from the prefix cor- \"completely\" plus rōborāre \"to strengthen\" (from rōbur \"strength\")."
  },
  "sententious": {
    "short": "If you speak in sententious phrases, your listeners are probably falling asleep, as your speech is pompous and pretentious, and full of moralistic babble.",
    "long": "When sententious first appeared in English — back in the late Middle Ages —  it meant \"full of wisdom,\" but now it usually has a negative sense, meaning heavy handed and self-important. The sententious blowhard makes people laugh, and you can probably think of at least three cartoon characters who fit the bill — often a politician or minister who drones on and on, oblivious to the fact that his audience is snickering or trying to sneak out."
  },
  "dissolve": {
    "short": "To dissolve something is to break it up or weaken it, making it no longer recognizable. You could dissolve your book club or you could even dissolve a pill by dropping it into a glass of water.",
    "long": "You can use the verb dissolve to describe things that are coming apart or diminishing. Dissolve goes back to the Latin root dissolvere, meaning \"to loosen,\" and it came into English in the 14th century. Physical objects dissolve, as when bubbles dissolve in the tub or a cube of sugar will dissolve in hot tea, and intangible, or non-physical, things can fade away too: \"Their friendship started to dissolve when he moved across country and they communicated less frequently.\""

    "long": "People respect others who are impressive for any reason, such as being in authority — like a teacher or cop — or being older — like a grandparent. You show respect by being polite and kind. For a lot of people, taking your hat off is a show of respect. When people are insulted or treated badly, they feel they haven't been treated with respect. You can respect things as well as people. Saying the Pledge of Allegiance shows respect to your country."
  },
  "enfeeble": {
    "short": "To enfeeble is to make someone or something very weak or fragile. Your governor's budget cuts might enfeeble the state's public school system.",
    "long": "If an illness weakens you — makes you feel frail and shaky — it enfeebles you. Aging enfeebles us, and the lack of Vitamin D in the winter also enfeebles many people. You can also say that making it harder for people to vote enfeebles the democratic process. The verb enfeeble combines the prefix en-, \"cause to be,\" with feeble, with its Latin root flebilis, \"that is to be wept over.\""
  },
  "lethargy": {
    "short": "Is your pet slug always this comatose, or is this display of lethargy unusual? The word lethargy describes inactivity or a lack of energy.",
    "long": "Lethargy comes from the Greek lethargos, originally meaning “inactive through forgetfulness.” Somewhere along the way, the word lost the implication of “forgetfulness” and just ended up hanging around in bed all day. Still, lethargy doesn’t necessarily imply laziness; it can be brought about by illness and may also describe a lack of strength. Other lethargic nouns include torpor, sluggishness, and languor."
  },
  "forge": {
    "short": "Have you ever seen a blacksmith make a horseshoe? Well, no, probably not, but they use a special furnace which is called a forge, and \"to forge something\" is also the act of bashing that hot object into shape.",
    "long": "Forge has also taken on the more general sense of creating something. A new philosophy or art form might have been forged, as might an alibi or an excuse. To forge something also has the meaning of faking something, such as a painting or a signature with the intent to deceive. It can also mean to move ahead in a steady manner, either physically or metaphorically, much like those solid, regular blows of the blacksmith's hammer."
  },
  "peripheral": {
    "short": "Scanners, printers, and speakers are peripheral devices for a computer because they aren't central to the working of the computer itself. Anything peripheral is on the margin, or outside, while main things, like a computer's processor, are not peripheral.",
    "long": "Outside of computer jargon, peripheral is a common term in eye exams, which measure peripheral vision to see how far toward the outer right and left edges you can see. Peripheral also describes nerves from the body's peripheral system, which are secondary to the main system but branch off of it — like the wires between peripheral devices and a computer."
  },
  "imposing": {
    "short": "Imposing is an adjective reserved for those things that are impressive in the sense that they are large or serious, as in the US Capitol Building or even, say, a professional wrestler.",
    "long": "When you look at the word imposing you see the word pose, which is useful in remembering what it means. A person who is imposing might strike a pose because they feel they have a lot to show. In fact, imposing is derived from the French verb imposer, which means \"to inflict.\" Its French roots may inspire you to envision the enormous and expensive wigs worn by members of the French court. The larger the wig, the more imposing it was. And all the more reason to strike a pose!"
  },
  "objective": {
    "short": "An objective is something you plan to achieve. A military objective is the overall plan for a mission. The objective for a bake sale is to raise money. If your objective is to learn a new word, you have succeeded.",
    "long": "An objective is the point of something. If you don’t understand the objective of a class, then you don’t know what you were supposed to learn. The word itself is often used in business or work. Another meaning of objective is “looking at things in a detached, impartial, fact-based way.” If a police officer falls in love with a witness, it might be hard for her to stay objective. The word comes from the Latin ob \"against\" + jacere \"to throw.”"
  },
  "obsession": {
    "short": "If you have an obsession, you're totally fixated on something and unhealthily devoted to it. Some common obsessions include fantasy football leagues, celebrity gossip, and Elvis memorabilia.",
    "long": "Obsession is kind of like a passion for something that crosses the line into crazy territory. Sometimes people get so preoccupied with their obsessions that it makes them anxious or emotionally unstable. If you have an obsession with the Yankees, for example, you might go to every single game, skip work to watch spring training, paper your room with Yankees posters, and write love notes to Derek Jeter."
  },
  "grandiose": {
    "short": "You've got big plans. Huge plans. Whatever it is, it's going to blow minds and absolutely rock worlds! Well, to some people those plans might sound a bit grandiose, or unnecessarily overblown and even highfalutin.",
    "long": "Coming from the Italian word grandioso (meaning \"grand\" or \"noble\"), the adjective grandiose is kind of like Italian hand gestures: big, exaggerated, and over the top. And it's that excessiveness that pushes something grand (large, with an air of distinction) into grandiose (large, but trying too hard) territory."
  },
  "reiterate": {
    "short": "To reiterate something is to say or do something again, or many times. Let me reiterate: if you repeat yourself, you're reiterating the thing you originally said.",
    "long": "This verb is from Middle English reiteraten, from Latin reiteratus, from reiterare \"to repeat,\" from the prefix re- \"again\" plus iterare \"to repeat, iterate.\" The English word iterate has the same meaning as reiterate, although it is not as commonly used."
  },
  "vanguard": {
    "short": "If you are in the vanguard, you're up front. It could be that you are in the vanguard of an advancing army, or in the vanguard of any movement, trend, or occupation.",
    "long": "Vanguard is an old variation of the French word avant-garde meaning \"fore-guard\" or \"front guard.\" Vanguard and avant-garde have the same basic meaning, but avant-garde generally describes artistic endeavors, while vanguard can be more widely applied. You might talk about the vanguard of fashion on the red carpet, the vanguard of medical research at a university, or the vanguard of a political movement at a demonstration."
  },
  "simultaneous": {
    "short": "The adjective simultaneous describes something that is done at the same time as something else. \"The teachers all assigned simultaneous projects to the students that week. The kids were grumbling and sleep-deprived due to the grind.\"",
    "long": "The Latin root of simultaneous is simul, which also means \"at the same time.\" One way to remember this word is to think of simulcast programs that are simultaneously available through different television networks, radio stations or Web sites — so you can catch that concert on TV while your friend is listening to it on his car radio."
  },
  "heyday": {
    "short": "A heyday is a peak of popularity or success. If you hear someone say \"Hey! Back in the day, I was the best boxer in the city! No one could beat me!\" he might be remembering his heyday as a fighter.",
    "long": "If you remember a time in the past when you were doing something really well or getting a lot of attention or fame, you might be reminiscing about your heyday. A person or an organization — and even a thing — can have a heyday, or a peak time when everything goes well. The good news is that a heyday can come again and again, so while your heyday as student president might be just a memory, there might be a heyday as governor of your state years later."

  "belittle": {
    "short": "To belittle means to put down, or to make another person feel as though they aren't important. Saying mean things about another person literally makes them feel \"little.\"",
    "long": "To belittle someone is a cruel way of making someone else seem less important than yourself. A candidate for office might belittle his opponent by pointing out during a press conference that his fellow candidate has an inferior intellect. Belittling doesn't have to come in the form of verbal abuse. A manager who forces his administrative assistant to scrub his office floor with a toothbrush belittles her as well."

  "neologism": {
    "short": "A neologism is a made-up or new word. Neologisms can be fun-ti-ful, but the problem is making sure others understand what you mean.",
    "long": "The word neologism was once a neologism itself. It was created by gluing the French prefix neo- onto the Greek logos or \"word.\" People coin neologisms all the time, linguists track which ones stick, and eventually, we all feel they're old friends. Or maybe not: random samples from words coined in 2003 include: adultolescence, pastability, pre-zactly, and neomaxizoomdweebie."
  },
  "acrimony": {
    "short": "Acrimony is bitterness, or ill will. Acrimony is a spiteful word. It sounds bitter, like acid.",
    "long": "Acrimony comes from the Latin word acrimonia, meaning basically \"sharpness.\" Although it sounds like matrimony, the only thing the words have in common is the suffix from monium which means \"state, condition.\" So it's the state of being acrid, or bitter. It's not just for married folks, though — this slightly dusty noun can refer to any sharp, bitter feeling. After a drawn-out court case, there might be lingering acrimony stirred up during the trial. Not surprisingly, it's also the name of a British heavy metal band from the '90s."
  },
  "empiricism": {
    "short": "Empiricism means a method of study relying on empirical evidence, which includes things you've experienced: stuff you can see and touch.",
    "long": "Empiricism is based on facts, evidence, and research. Scholars and researchers deal in empiricism. If you believe in the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, or Santa Claus, you're out of the realm of empiricism — there are no facts to support those myths. If you want to get something practical done, or to really know what the deal is with something, empiricism is the way to go."
  },
  "conciliatory": {
    "short": "If you're in a fight with a friend and you want to end it, you should make a conciliatory gesture, such as inviting her to a party you're having. Conciliatory describes things that make other people less angry.",
    "long": "The context is often a situation in which a dispute is settled by compromise. A synonym is propitiatory, though this adjective usually refers to avoiding the anger of someone who has the power to harm. In the word conciliatory, the –ory suffix means \"relating to or doing,\" and the root is from Latin conciliatus, from conciliare \"to bring together, win over,\" from concilium \"council.\""
  },
  "flaccid": {
    "short": "If something is limp, loose, droopy, and wrinkly, you can call it flaccid, which rhymes with \"acid.\" Think elephant skin, soggy asparagus, and the type of feeble handshakes frowned on in job interviews.",
    "long": "We get the word flaccid from the Latin flaccus, which meant \"flabby.\" The meaning is pretty much the same today, though it applies to  more than physical flab. Flaccid pops up in conversation to describe lackluster leadership, dull conversation, and even feeble attempts at word definitions. If a politician's election campaign is flaccid, it will surprise no one that he only receives two votes — one from his grandmother and the other from someone who accidentally checked the wrong box on the ballot."
  },
  "corollary": {
    "short": "Corollary describes a result that is the natural consequence of something else. You could say that your renewed love of books is a corollary to the recent arrival of a book store in your neighborhood.",
    "long": "The noun corollary describes an action's consequence, such as having to study more, a corollary to getting a bad grade. The word is often seen with the prepositions “to” or “of,\" as in “a corollary to fortune is fame.” Math enthusiasts may already be familiar with the word corollary, which can be used more formally to describe a new proof or proposition that follows naturally from an established one."
  },
  "omniscient": {
    "short": "To be omniscient is to know everything. This often refers to a special power of God.",
    "long": "If you combine the Latin roots omnis (meaning \"all\") and scientia (meaning \"knowledge\"), you'll get omniscient, meaning \"knowledge of all.\" It would be nice to be omniscient: then you would know absolutely everything in the world. Many religions have a god who is all-powerful and omniscient. This is how a god is supposed to know when you sinned, or what's going to happen in the future."
  },
  "edify": {
    "short": "To edify is to help someone understand, whether it is books that edify those who want to learn a new language, or the explanations that hang beside paintings at a museum that edify visitors who aren't familiar with the artist.",
    "long": "If you know that the noun edifice is a synonym for building, you may wonder what the related verb edify has to do with understanding. You can think of something that edifies as the building blocks of what might become a lifelong interest, like an elementary school teacher who edifies the student who becomes an Abraham Lincoln scholar, or an activity you eventually master, like the beginners' lessons that edify new ice skaters."
  },
  "pithy": {
    "short": "A pithy phrase or statement is brief but full of substance and meaning. Proverbs and sayings are pithy; newspaper columnists give pithy advice.",
    "long": "The root of this word is pith, which refers to the spongy tissue in plant stems, or the white part under the skin of citrus fruits. Pith is also used figuratively to refer to the essential part of something: They finally got to the pith of the discussion. Pith descends from Middle English, from Old English pitha \"the pith of plants.\" In the adjective pithy, the suffix –y means \"characterized by.\""
  },
  "myopic": {
    "short": "Myopic is an adjective meaning shortsighted in every sense. Whether you need glasses or a new attitude, if you can't see the forest for the trees, you're myopic.",
    "long": "Myopic began as a description of the condition that made people squint and was easily cured with a pair of pink cat-eye glasses, but it came to include people or plans with a lack of foresight. Although it's good to live in the moment, it's not a compliment to be called myopic — a myopic party host might have festive decorations but no food for hungry guests, and myopic students have no interest in anything beyond what's on the test. In terms of pronunciation: it's a tomato/tomahto word: pronounce it \"my-OP-ick\" or \"my-OH-pick,\" although that short o sound is preferred."

  "conscript": {
    "short": "If you’re ever drafted into the army, then you could be called a conscript, someone who is forced to join the military.",
    "long": "At the root of conscript is the Latin word conscriptus, meaning “enroll.” Conscript does involve enrollment — but it’s a forced enrollment, used to describe someone who has been forced to join the military, such as someone who has been drafted. As a verb, conscript means \"force to join,\" like a military that conscripts new soldiers. In contrast, those who choose to join are recruited; when they enter the service, they enlist."
  },
  "fossil": {
    "short": "Fossils are the really, really old remains of a plant or animal — so old they've turned to stone. Fossil is also an insult for an old or old-fashioned person.",
    "long": "Fossils are very important to scientists who study animals: they're one of the ways we learn about the beasts and critters of the past. A fossil is an imprint of the bones of that animal in rock or stone. If you see a reconstruction of a dinosaur in a museum, scientists used fossils to figure out how it should look. Also, calling someone a fossil is like calling them a geezer or old fogey. It's not a compliment."
  },
  "immense": {
    "short": "Immense means very large in size, amount, or degree. You might describe the ocean as immense, or your homework load, or the slice of cake your brother took, leaving you a tiny sliver.",
    "long": "This word has an immense number of near synonyms: huge, great, enormous, vast, gigantic, colossal, mammoth, copious, tremendous are a few of the more common ones. If you're having immense difficulty deciding which word to use, just plain \"very big\" might do."
  },
  "empathy": {
    "short": "Use empathy if you're looking for a noun meaning \"the ability to identify with another's feelings.\"",
    "long": "When Bill Clinton famously told people \"I feel your pain\" during his 1992 election campaign, some praised and others ridiculed him for displaying empathy, the sharing or understanding of feelings. Empathy is different from sympathy, which is pity or sorrow for others' misfortunes. They share a common root in -pathy, from the Greek pathos, \"feeling.\" Where they differ is in their prefixes: sym- means \"with,\" while em- means \"in.\" If you can empathize with someone, it's because you have been in their place: you've \"walked a mile in their shoes,\" as the saying goes."
  },
  "distort": {
    "short": "Distort means to twist out of shape. When you look at a tree through a twisting kaleidoscope, you distort its image, making its branches and leaves look wavy and misshapen.",
    "long": "Distort is a verb that means to change the shape of something. You can distort pretzel dough by twisting it into the shape of an \"S\" instead of a normal pretzel shape. You can also distort, or change, the meaning of something. When one distorts the truth, it might not be an out-and-out lie; it could just be an exaggeration — like telling your pals you caught a six-foot tuna when you actually landed a six-inch minnow."

  "deduct": {
    "short": "To deduct is to remove or take away some amount. If your boss deducts money from your paycheck because you're always late to work, she subtracts it.",
    "long": "When taxes are withheld from your salary, your employer deducts them to pay your contribution. Each time you use a debit card, it deducts the amount you spend from your bank account. A different way to deduct is to come to a reasoned, thoughtful conclusion, or to deduce. The two words were once interchangeable, while now it's more common to use deduct to mean \"remove a portion,\" and deduce to mean \"infer logically.\""

  "ancestry": {
    "short": "Have a family tree hanging on the wall? Then you know a bit about your ancestry, or family history and lineage.",
    "long": "If you think ancestry sounds like ancestor, then you're headed in the right direction. Ancestry is basically a history of ancestors, a trail of where your family started and all the descendants that followed. But ancestry goes much further than just your great-great-grand uncle's brother. You can also use the word ancestry to refer to the background of things other than people — such as the ancestry of a building or the ancestry of a nation."
  },
  "fickle": {
    "short": "People who are fickle change their minds so much you can't rely on them. If your best friend suddenly decides that she doesn't like you one week, and then the next week she wants to hang out again, she's being fickle.",
    "long": "Fickle comes from the Old English word ficol, for deceitful.  We usually use fickle to talk about people, but it can also be used for abstract things that alternately favor you and abuse you, like the weather. If you win the lottery and then lose everything else in the world that's important to you, fate is being fickle."
  },
  "surge": {
    "short": "A surge is a sudden strong swelling, like a tsunami wave that engulfs the land. Although a surge offers a fluid image, anything can experience a sudden surge, including emotions, political support, or an angry mob.",
    "long": "The original Latin word surgere, meaning “to spring up or rise,” serves as the basis for the word surge, which refers to a great sudden growth or swelling.  If you are watching a sad movie and you experience a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a tissue, pretend something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with reckless abandon?  Yeah, me too.  Christmas shopping can be dangerous when there is a surge of interest in one toy and desperate shoppers surge into stores trying to grab it up."
  },
  "impertinent": {
    "short": "If someone's rude without being openly nasty, like a kid in the back row of class quietly heckling his teacher, you can call him impertinent.",
    "long": "Impertinent originally meant just what it sounds like, \"not pertinent, irrelevant,\" but it also came to mean \"inappropriate, out of place\" and therefore \"intrusive, presumptuous; behaving without proper respect; insolent.\" It still carries a condescending air, so it's best used of or to a child being snippy to a grownup: \"Don't be impertinent!\" The stress is on the second syllable: im-PERT-inent."
  },
  "calamity": {
    "short": "Use the word calamity to describe an event that causes great harm and misery, or a general state of distress or misery: the calamity of war.",
    "long": "Near synonyms are catastrophe and disaster. The noun calamity is from Middle English calamytey, from Latin calamitas, a word which might be related to Latin clades \"destruction.\" Calamity Jane was the nickname of a 19th-century woman living on the U.S. frontier. She claimed to have some very exciting adventures."
  },
  "null": {
    "short": "Null means having no value; in other words null is zero, like if you put so little sugar in your coffee that it’s practically null. Null also means invalid, or having no binding force.",
    "long": "From the Latin nullus, meaning \"not any,\" poor, powerless null is not actually there at all. Or if it was, it’s gone now. Because null is basically nothing, zip, zilch, nada, and nix. What could be worse? Maybe being \"null and void,\" which is a legal term making something really, really null. Null is the base of the word nullify, which means to make something invalid or to cancel something out."

  "duel": {
    "short": "A duel is a fight between two people, usually using swords or other weapons. If you tend to be a little cowardly, you're probably glad that people aren't expected to defend their honor with a duel these days.",
    "long": "The classic definition of a duel is the kind that happens all the time in Shakespeare plays: two men clanking swords together in a battle to the death over some issue of honor or betrayal. Today, the word duel can be used to talk about any kind of contest or struggle — like a duel between political candidates. The word duel can be traced back to both duo, Latin for \"two,\" and also duellum, which means \"war.\""

    "long": "The adjective, cognitive, comes from the Latin cognoscere \"to get to know\" and refers to the ability of the brain to think and reason as opposed to feel. A child's cognitive development is the growth in his or her ability to think and solve problems.

    "short": "If you're standing at the top of a hill looking down to the bottom, you're staring down a declivity, a downward slope of any kind.",
    "long": "The word declivity comes from the Latin words de, which means \"down,\" and clivus, which means \"slope.\" If you're at the bottom of the hill looking up, you'll see the opposite of a declivity. From that position you'll be looking at an acclivity, an upward slope."

  "scruple": {
    "short": "Your scruples are what keep you from doing things you consider to be morally or ethically wrong. Your scruples won't allow you to cheat on a test, or steal from your brother's Halloween candy stash.",
    "long": "The noun scruple comes from a Latin word, scrupulus, which means a small, sharp stone. Some say that the philosopher Cicero first used the word analogously to compare a worry to a small, sharp stone in your shoe that bothers you. From there the word scruple took on the ethical principles meaning. If you are doing something bad, your scruples will bother you — but emptying your shoe probably won't help."

    "long": "You can also use encumber to describe something that restricts you in some way: you're so encumbered by your homework load you can’t go to the concert Saturday night. The root, cumber, has several shades of meaning — including \"to burden\" and \"to be overwhelmed.\""

  "punctilious": {
    "short": "A punctilious person pays attention to details. Are you always precisely on time? Is your room perfectly neat? Do you never forget a birthday or a library book's due date? Then you are one of the punctilious people.",
    "long": "The adjective punctilious, pronounced \"punk-TIL-ee-us,\" is related to the Italian word puntiglio, meaning \"fine point.\" For someone who is punctilious no point is too fine, no detail too small, to be overlooked. The word is often used to describe people, but it can be used more broadly to apply to observations, behavior, or anything else that is characterized by close attention to detail."
  },
  "laborious": {
    "short": "Laborious describes something that requires a lot of hard work, such as Victor Frankenstein’s laborious undertaking of digging graves to find monster parts.",
    "long": "Laborious comes from the familiar word for work, labor, which doesn’t veer far from its roots in Old French meaning \"exertion of the body,\" and from Latin “toil, pain, exertion, fatigue.” Anything that requires blood, sweat, and tears is laborious, and while it’s usually a good thing to work hard, laborious can also describe something over-thought, such as the heavy-handed plot of a bad TV show. Think labor plus boring, said like an old-fashioned English aristocrat: luh-bohr-ee-uhs."

  "muster": {
    "short": "Originally meaning \"to gather soldiers,\" muster has been expanded to include gathering up just about anything — you can muster up some dinner, some friends, or even some ketchup, pickles and mustard.",
    "long": "Remember that muster used to involve getting reluctant soldiers out of bed and into the field of battle — so it involves overcoming a certain inertia. When you muster up the courage to face something, it's clear that this is pretty scary for you."

    "long": "When you accentuate, you draw attention to something. You could wear a green shirt to accentuate your green eyes, for example. You can also accentuate words when you give them added stress. An actor might accentuate certain words in a monologue in order to emphasize the character's anger. This word traces all the way back to the Latin verb canere, \"to sing.\""

A Frisbee neophyte is someone who has just thrown the disc for the first time."

    "long": "It's said that Paul Bunyan hewed the Grand Canyon by dragging his giant mythical axe behind him. But usually things are hewn with a little more purpose — with each chop and cut designed to shape, sculpt, or craft a final product.

It can also mean challenging conventions and doing things that most people don't do, such as when Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in the United States to become a doctor.

    "long": "Appearing in English in the 17th century, the word atrophy originally described a lack of nourishment. Atrophy occurs in parts of the body that can't move or be \"fed\" because of disease or injury. It also is used to describe things that go dull through lack of use, like skills in sports or artistic creativity.

    "long": "From the Old English fægnian, meaning “rejoice, exult, be glad,” fawning can be both an adjective and a noun form of the verb fawn. Fawning people are often trying to win favor with the person being flattered, and it sometimes comes off as sucking up. So do everyone a favor and don't try to boost your poor grades by fawning over your professor’s every word."

Virtue can also mean excellence in general. One of your virtues might be your generous willingness to help out your friends.

Being a great baseball player requires real gifts, no doubt, but even the most gifted player won't make it to the big leagues without the tenacity required to make the long, hard journey up from the minors. Tenacity is the quality displayed by someone who just won't quit — who keeps trying until they reach their goal."

Obsequious people are usually not being genuine; they resort to flattery and other fawning ways to stay in the good graces of authority figures.

    "long": "It wasn't enough just to win a battle. A conquering army had to pillage entire cities, taking everything of value that wasn't nailed down. \r\n\r\nRecently, several European families have won cases in international courts against museums displaying art that was looted by the Nazis during World War II.

    "short": "When you make fun of something by imitating it in a humorous way, you're lampooning it. The writers at The Onion, Saturday Night Live and FunnyOrDie.com are all experts in the art of the lampoon.",
    "long": "Lampoon can be both a verb and a noun. To lampoon is ridicule. A lampoon is a parody or satire. Imagine you were frustrated by having your allowance reduced, so you wrote a funny play portraying mom and dad as dictators extracting lots of unfair taxes from their people. That's lampooning. And it probably won't help your allowance situation."

    "long": "Solitary comes to us from the Latin solus, which means alone. Note its similarity to words like solo and, for all you card players out there, solitaire. You can take a solitary walk, during which you don't utter a solitary word, but pause to admire a solitary green shoot peeping through the snow. Solitary is also common in the prison world: Inmates on Alcatraz who were deemed too dangerous to mingle with their fellows were put in solitary confinement cells."

    "long": "Felicitous can mean \"appropriate,\" but it also describes something that's lucky. When you plan a trip to the amusement park and it turns out that the sun is shining, that’s felicitous. If you need to mail a package by a certain date and you make it to the post office just in time, that’s also felicitous. The Latin root of felicitous is felix, \"happy or lucky.\""

  "disavow": {
    "short": "To disavow is to deny support for someone or something. You might feel dissed if your biggest donor decides to suddenly disavow you in your run for president.",
    "long": "Disavow comes from a combination of the Old French prefix des- meaning \"opposite of\" and the word avoer meaning to \"acknowledge, accept, recognize.\" When you disavow, you are doing the opposite of acknowledging or accepting. You're rejecting or denying.  When you disavow something you've done in the past, you reject or deny what you've done."

    "long": "Doing calisthenics usually involves simple movements, like stretching, jumping, bending, and kicking, that don't involve a lot of equipment, if any. Kids in gym class do calisthenics, and calisthenics are helpful to many people, including athletes and people in the military. The push-up is a famous example of calisthenics. Those limber folks on cheerleading squads are masters of calisthenics. A little calisthenics can be helpful in anyone's everyday routine as a way to build endurance and stay healthy."

This verb goes beyond mere criticism; it implies anger, a harsh and insulting tone, and even a scathing attack. Synonyms of excoriate include denounce, decry, and condemn. In a medical sense, excoriate means “to tear skin off by chafing.” A bad rug burn can excoriate your skin. If someone excoriates you verbally, it might make you feel like you’ve been physically excoriated."

  "fracas": {
    "short": "If your marching band gets into a fight with another school's pep squad, your principal might say the fracas was uncalled for and undignified. A fracas is a noisy quarrel.",
    "long": "Fracas comes from an Italian word meaning uproar or crash. Two people in a quiet little spat is not a fracas, but a schoolyard rumble definitely qualifies as one!

    "long": "Many things that are fluffy give comfort, like the soft pillows on your bed. But sometimes fluffy is a put-down. News programs that tell you everything about celebrities and nothing about important events are fluffy. So are silly, pointless conversations — which, like favorite pillows, are sometimes exactly what you need."

    "short": "To contravene means to go against or defy. You might contravene your parents' ban on sweets when your friend offers to share her candy because chocolate tastes too good to resist!",
    "long": "If you contravene something in practice, you act in direct violation of a particular law or rule. Think about the times when someone has told you not to cross a line and you do anyway. You can also contravene in words though, which means you contradict or argue against a statement. Let's say you're debating gun control. If your opponent says that for the safety of all, it should be legal to carry a concealed weapon wherever you go, you might answer that the more concealed weapons there are, the more violence. You are contravening your opponent's argument."

  "valediction": {
    "short": "A valediction is a speech that wishes a group of people farewell. It's most commonly given at graduations.",
    "long": "The word diction in valediction is a clue that this word has to do with speaking, since it comes from the Latin root dicere, \"to say.\" When combined with valere, \"be well,\" the result is valedicere, \"bid farewell.\" Just about any type of school that has a graduation ceremony will have a valediction, which typically congratulates students on their accomplishments and inspires them to look ahead."

    "long": "Malady, pronounced \"MAL-uh-dee,\" comes from the Latin words male, meaning \"bad or ill\" and habitus for \"have, hold.\" When you have a malady, it is like something bad is holding you, such as an illness — the common cold: a malady of winter.

In a more general sense, the word means break down, wear out, or reduce in numbers. A triple overtime basketball game, with many players fouling out, is a war of attrition. When you see the word attrition, think \"Gradually chipping away.\""

  "squander": {
    "short": "To squander means to spend extravagantly, thoughtlessly, or wastefully. If you need to save for college, don't squander your income on nightly sushi dinners.",
    "long": "Squander used to mean scatter, and the way we use it now implies throwing something (like money) all over the place. You can squander time as well as money. If you have a big deadline but you are chatting away or looking at social networking sites, you are squandering your time. If you have an opportunity to play for a major league baseball team but show up late to tryouts and criticize the coach, you have probably squandered your chance."

    "long": "In general, the environs are the areas surrounding a particular place or location. Environs is a plural noun taking a plural verb, and it comes from an Old French word, environer, meaning to enclose, surround, or encircle.

    "long": "Sometimes truisms can be mistaken for factual statements. In fact, despite their seeming obviousness, they are usually opinions. Many people who look up words in the dictionary don't improve their vocabularies, as much as they'd like to. Another truism: You get what you pay for. Well, a lot of the time, sure, but not always. That's why the word bargain was invented."

    "short": "Someone who is haughty is arrogant and full of pride. When you're haughty, you have a big attitude and act like you're better than other people.",
    "long": "A haughty person acts superior and looks down on others. Haughty people are disdainful, overbearing, prideful, swaggering, and obnoxious. Acting amazed that others haven't heard of a hot new band is haughty. Speaking in a cocky or superior way is haughty. The word even sounds a little like its meaning: it's hard to say haughty without sounding like you have an attitude. If you're acting like others are beneath you, you're being haughty."

  "imposter": {
    "short": "An imposter is a person who pretends to be someone else. Someone who tries to convince you that he's your long lost cousin in order to get an invitation to stay in your awesome apartment is an imposter.",
    "long": "An imposter usually seeks some kind of financial gain when he or she assumes another person's identity, but there can be other motivations, like simply the thrill of doing it. Any imposter who pretends to be the sibling of a famous person, for instance, will get lots of attention. The Latin root is impostorem, \"impose upon or deceive.\" It's more commonly spelled impostor, although both spellings are correct."

  "substantial": {
    "short": "Something substantial is large in size, number, or amount: If you want to say someone spent a lot of money without being too specific, you could say they spent a substantial amount of money.",
    "long": "The adjective substantial derives from the Latin substantia \"substance,\" which means \"stuff.\" A substantial meal is large enough to satisfy hunger. A substantial structure is strongly made or built. And a substantial man possesses wealth and property. Related to this last sense, \"a man of substance\" refers to a wealthy man with property."

    "long": "When you see the word antique, you know you're not going to hear about anything new or young. An antique is a nice, old piece of furniture, that's usually been well taken care of and costs more than something new. Shopping for antiques is called antiquing. Outside of antique shops, calling anything antique means it's out-of-date and useless — so if you wanted to be mean, you could call your grandparents antiques."

  "flagrant": {
    "short": "Something flagrant is bad — so bad you can't ignore it. A flagrant foul in sports might send you to the bench, and a flagrant violation of the law might send you to the slammer.",
    "long": "The current meaning of the adjective flagrant — \"obviously offensive or disgraceful\" — is thought to derive from the Latin legal term in flagrante delicto, which literally meant \"with fire still blazing\" and is used figuratively to describe a situation in which the criminal is caught red handed. Aside from a flagrant abuse of the law, the word can also be used to describe anything that is obviously bad — like flagrant bad taste or flagrant abuse of the rules of grammar."

    "long": "There are many ways to be an oaf: you can be loud, insensitive, rude, or just plain stupid. The word is related to the Old English word for \"elf,\" and originally meant a changeling — an elf's child, a little darling not known for good manners — and you probably wouldn't want one of them at your party either."

  "ancestor": {
    "short": "An ancestor came before. Your grandmother's grandmother and any relative before her is one of your ancestors.",
    "long": "Ante-, a common Latin prefix, means \"before.\" Cedere is Latin for \"to go.\" So, an ancestor is someone who has gone before us. Evolutionary biologists have advanced the theory that all life on earth descends from a common ancestor. Ancestor can also mean \"prototype\" or \"forerunner.\" The abacus is a distant ancestor of today's supercomputers."

  "pathology": {
    "short": "Pathology is the medical term for the way a disease works. A tumor is removed by a doctor trained in surgery, but you need a doctor trained in pathology to tell you if the tumor is cancer.",
    "long": "Pathology derives from the Greek pathos \"suffering\" and ology \"study of\"––to give us \"the study of disease,\" but often pathology means the disease's behavior––the cancer pathology is to take over healthy cells and grow cancerous tumors.

You may have heard that opposites attract, but initial attraction doesn’t necessarily mean that opposites will be compatible in the long-term.

    "long": "Even though incorrigible implies a person is kind of hopeless, it's often used as a light-hearted word. When we describe someone as an incorrigible flirt or as an incorrigible gossip, we mean that this is just the way they are, and it would be foolish to try and change them. If someone is just being obnoxious as usual, you could say \"You're incorrigible!\""

    "long": "Don’t let epithet’s bad reputation fool you — that’s only half the story. An epithet can be harmless, a nickname that catches on, like all hockey fans knowing that \"Sid the Kid\" is Sidney Crosby.

    "long": "Sometimes spelled despatch, this word was first used in the early 1500s as a verb meaning “to send off in a hurry.” These days we get hurried dispatches in noun and verb form, from journalists sending in their war zone stories to emergency squads getting dispatched to the scene of an accident.

That's because starting in the 1650s, abysmal simply meant “resembling an abyss in depth.” By that definition you've just received a compliment on your deep digging skills. But since the early twentieth century, abysmal has been more commonly used to identify something as \"extremely bad.\" So it's more likely that your hole has just been insulted."

The noun is from Latin cēnsūra, \"censorship,\" from cēnsor, \"an ancient Roman censor.\" The job of a Roman censor was to take the census and to supervise public morals and behavior.

The meaning shifted to \"reckless\" a few hundred years later, and can still be used that way — a \"rash decision\" is a sudden, not well thought out one. Rash, the noun that no one wants on their skin, came a few hundred years after that, but from the French word rache which at some point meant \"ringworm.\" Ringworm still gives us a red, itchy rash.

The word is often used to describe political commentary or cultural criticism. One person known for her trenchant wit was the author and critic Mary McCarthy, who once said of the writer Lillian Hellman, \"Every word she writes is a lie, including the 'and' and the 'the'.\""

  "outlandish": {
    "short": "If something is outlandish it's bizarre or unfamiliar, far outside the boundaries of expected or normal behavior. Driving around the city in a golf cart and eating spaghetti with pineapple sauce are both examples of outlandish behavior.",
    "long": "It's easy to imagine how the word outlandish originated. The Old English root is utland, which literally means \"out-land,\" or foreign.  Now, it would be inappropriate to refer to a foreigner as outlandish, unless, say, he shows up to the office in a red patent-leather Speedo and a ten-gallon hat."
  },
  "burgeon": {
    "short": "Use the verb burgeon to describe something that is growing, expanding, and flourishing. If you have a green thumb, in the spring your flower gardens may burgeon. If you don't have a green thumb, your collection of plastic plants may burgeon.",
    "long": "Although burgeon means to grow and flourish, it doesn't necessarily have to apply only to plants. Your town can have burgeoning downtown development. Your tiny retirement account can burgeon into an excellent emergency fund if you invest even a small amount each month. You may have a burgeoning career as a villain if you overthrow a planet by using your mind-controlling ray gun on the populace."
  },
  "reminisce": {
    "short": "Reminisce is a dreamy way of saying \"remember the past.\" If you're swapping old stories with friends and remembering all the silly things you used to do, then you're reminiscing.",
    "long": "Reminiscing is all about happy recollections and thinking back to stories from the past. It's hard to reminisce about the old days with someone you don't know very well or haven't known very long, since a key part of reminiscing is a shared history. But just about anyone can reminisce about going elementary school, learning to tie shoelaces, or getting that first job."
  },
  "vanity": {
    "short": "Vanity is the quality of being vain, or having a ridiculous amount of pride. If you have excessive vanity in your appearance, you probably spend long hours sitting at your vanity table doing your makeup or plucking your nose hairs.",
    "long": "If you pride yourself on looking absolutely perfect and refuse to do any work that might dirty your clothes or mess up your hair, someone might accuse you of vanity. Often vanity is empty, like the emperor’s in The Emperor's New Clothes. If someone pays to have her own book published even though it’s really bad, we say it is a vanity printing."
  },
  "coterie": {
    "short": "Have you noticed how so many of the best TV shows concentrate on a group of friends who seem to mesh together perfectly, to the exclusion of all others? This, then, is a coterie, an exclusive group with common interests.",
    "long": "The modern spelling and meaning of coterie developed in the 18th century from a French word rooted in the feudal system. When the farmers working the land of a feudal lord established an organization, they were called cotiers, or \"tenants of a cote\" (think \"cottage\"), and that idea of a select group led to the word coterie. There's just something so French about the idea of exclusivity, isn't there?"
  },
  "hallowed": {
    "short": "The adjective hallowed is used to describe something that is sacred and revered, usually something old and steeped in tradition.",
    "long": "The word hallowed often has a religious connotation, but it can also be used playfully to convey a sense of reverence about something that isn’t religious in nature but that nonetheless inspires worship. A football fan, for example, may talk about the hallowed tradition of tailgating on a game day Saturday, or an avid shopper may describe the hallowed grounds of the Macy’s shoe department. In the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln used the word with its more traditional sense to ponder man's inability to show the proper reverence to those men who died in battle: \"But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate…we cannot consecrate…we cannot hallow…this ground.\""
  },
  "parley": {
    "short": "A formal discussion between enemies or opponents is called a parley. A British drummer called for a parley between the British and American armies in 1781, and officers from both sides then discussed the terms of Britain's surrender.",
    "long": "Parley can also be used as a verb, meaning to discuss or negotiate, such as between enemies or opponents. If your siblings are fighting, you may need to encourage them to parley in another room in order to discuss their differences and hopefully settle the problem once and for all."
  },
  "prevail": {
    "short": "Prevail means to successfully persuade someone of something. If you were a Presidential advisor and you convinced him to make a National Day of Pet Appreciation, then you prevailed upon him to recognize pets.",
    "long": "Prevail can be used for different kinds of success. If you prevail upon someone, you have influence on them. If you prevail over someone, you win. Say you’re a big fan of a losing team. You might cheer, “Despite all odds, we will prevail!” To use prevail, there has to be some kind of contest or conflict. That could be internal, like when you have a pile of homework to do, but your desire to play video games prevails over your discipline."
  },
  "surmount": {
    "short": "If you surmount a challenge or difficult situation, you're not just getting over it. You're outdoing yourself, exceeding expectations, and overcoming the task at hand.",
    "long": "This word comes to us from the Old French verb for mount, or climb. Maria sang \"climb every mountain...\" in The Sound of Music. But she could have just as well meant \"surmount every obstacle\" — because to surmount means to both reach the highest point of something, like a mountain, and to totally overcome a mountain-size problem."
  },
  "exemplify": {
    "short": "If you exemplify something, you're the perfect example of it.  Say you wear frilly shirts, knee-high boots, and black eye-make-up — you exemplify the fashion world's obsession with pirates.",
    "long": "Exemplifying something can also mean make it clearer by offering an illustration or an example.  If you want to exemplify your argument that, say, pirate gear is fashionable, you might want to show your friends some pictures of celebrities wearing eye patches."
  },
  "unseemly": {
    "short": "Something that is inappropriate or unacceptable behavior is unseemly. It's a gentler, somewhat nicer word for \"inappropriate\" than its synonyms, the \"in\" words: \"indecent, indecorous, indelicate, inelegant, inept\" — well, you get the idea.",
    "long": "Knowing that the \"un-\" prefix turns a word into its opposite, you'll see that unseemly means \"not seemly.\" Let's look at that word (which is related to our verb seem), because it carries the real meaning. Seemly goes back to around 1200, to the Old Norse word soemr, \"fitting, becoming.\" The negative \"un-\" was added in the early 14th century to denote the opposite meaning. \"Seems\" to make sense, doesn’t it?"
  },
  "obituary": {
    "short": "An obituary is the notice of someone's death. It is placed in the newspaper to alert others to the death. It gives a background about the deceased's life, usually listing survivors and giving funeral information.",
    "long": "The noun obituary, which appears in English in the early 18th century, comes from the Latin obīre, where ob- means \"toward,\" and īre, \"to go,\" suggesting a \"going toward\" one's death. The first obituary as we know it probably appeared shortly after the invention of the printing press and included just the bare facts of the death. In 19th-century England, the announcements became more elaborate, and photos were added in the 20th century, making the modern obituary more like an elaborate eulogy."
  },
  "larceny": {
    "short": "Larceny is the legal term for stealing. Grand larceny is when you take something worth a lot of money, petty larceny when the stolen item is worth relatively little.",
    "long": "Larceny is used when talking about stealing someone's property in regards to the law. If you illegally download music or plagiarize a text, that may be theft, but it is not larceny because there was no physical property involved. If you take a friend's yoyo and don't give it back, it's stealing — unless your friend calls the police and has you arrested on charges of larceny."
  },
  "deplorable": {
    "short": "Deplorable is an adjective used to describe something extremely bad or unfortunate, like the deplorable destruction and loss of life in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami.",
    "long": "Deplorable comes from the French word déplorer meaning \"to give up as hopeless,\" meaning something is so bad, there is no hope of improvement like the deplorable actions of the arsonist who burned down the museum filled with priceless antiques. Deplorable can also describe something that is of terrible quality or unhealthful, like the deplorable state of the area under your bed — is that a moldy sandwich under there?"
  },
  "prerogative": {
    "short": "A prerogative is someone's special right or privilege. As Bobby Brown once sang, \"I don't need permission / Make my own decisions / That's my prerogative.\"",
    "long": "Prerogative goes back to a Latin root for a group having the right to vote first (prae-, \"pre-\" + rogare, \"to ask\") and thus came to mean \"privileged rank.\" In current use, it refers to a right or privilege held by any person or group. A near synonym is privilege, which puts more emphasis on the fact that others do not have it. The self-justifying phrase \"That's my prerogative\" (for example, in reference to changing one's mind) is quite common."
  },
  "oculist": {
    "short": "People who lived in previous centuries who had trouble seeing street signs, reading small print, or suddenly had horrible eye pain, would have visited an oculist. This was a doctor who dealt with eye disorders.",
    "long": "The root word, oculus, is Latin for “eye.” Oculist is actually a rather out-dated and old-fashioned term. Now, the more popular names for these kinds of doctors are ophthalmologist and optometrist. Ophthalmologists deal with more serious problems and diseases. Optometrists address less serious issues, perform vision tests, and prescribe corrective lenses."
  },
  "grumble": {
    "short": "When you grumble, you complain about something clearly but quietly, in a low mutter. Some people grumble a hundred times a day, about everything from the weather to the traffic to their bad luck at bowling.",
    "long": "The verb grumble is a great example of onomatopoeia, a word that sounds just like what it means. When you say \"grumble\" out loud, you're practically already grumbling about something. The origin of grumble is the Middle French word grommeler, or \"mutter through the teeth.\" Just think about the things in life that make you want to mutter through your teeth and you'll probably start to grumble."
  },
  "impeccable": {
    "short": "The adjective impeccable describes something or someone without any flaws. A stand-up comedian needs  impeccable timing for her jokes to work.",
    "long": "The adjective impeccable refers to something or someone without marking or error — but it can describe something spotless or clean. The word comes from the Latin impeccabilis, \"to be sinless,\" which is also an outdated sense in English. You can see how \"clean\" comes from \"sinless.\" Because of the messy nature of picnic food, it is highly unlikely that you would leave with your clothing still as impeccable as when you arrived, especially if you like lots of mustard and ketchup!"
  },
  "jingoistic": {
    "short": "If your car sports a bumper sticker that reads, \"my country, right or wrong,\" you might be accused of being jingoistic, or of taking your love for your country way too far.",
    "long": "The line between patriotic and jingoistic can sometimes seem vague and confusing. Both adjectives describe a devotion  to one's country, but jingoistic implies a fanatical allegiance that goes beyond pride, and often includes aggression toward other countries. The word jingo, \"mindless, gung-ho patriot,\" arose from a popular 1878 song that praised Britain's warlike stance toward Russia at the time, and came into American use in the 1890s during the Spanish-American war."
  },
  "remission": {
    "short": "Remission refers to a stage of lesser intensity, when something subsides or improves. Remission is usually a good thing — like when your cancer is in remission, it means that it is manageable and not getting any worse.",
    "long": "Remission comes from the Latin remissionem, meaning \"relaxation; a sending back.\" If something difficult lets up, you'll be able to relax a little. For example, if you are being pelted non-stop during a dodgeball game, you'd hope for a remission so you'd have a minute to take a breath and find your glasses. Another meaning of the noun remission is a payment. Your college tuition remission must be taken care of before you start classes."
  },
  "eject": {
    "short": "It’s good to eject yourself from a burning spaceship (if you happen to have an escape pod and a nice small planet to land on), but if a teacher ejects you from class, well that’s not so good.",
    "long": "Eject comes from “jectere,” the Latin word meaning throw, but the “e” means out. If you want to say, “throw the rascals out!” in only one word, you should choose, “eject!” The opposite of eject is inject. Thinking about the nurse throwing the measles vaccine into your arm makes that doctor’s visit seem a little less friendly."
  },
  "harangue": {
    "short": "A harangue is more than a speech, louder than a discussion, and nastier than a lecture. It is a verbal attack that doesn't let up, delivered as a verb or received as a noun. Either way, it's pretty unpleasant.",
    "long": "The word harangue developed its modern spelling around 1530, when the word was recorded as harangue in French. The word, meaning a strong, nasty rant, appears to have evolved from the Old Italian word aringa, probably from the word for a public square or place for public speaking. This in turn appears to have evolved from a Germanic word related to ring, as in \"circular gathering,\" which is clearly similar to the Italian meaning."
  },
  "function": {
    "short": "In the old \"Schoolhouse Rock\" song, \"Conjunction junction, what's your function?,\" the word function means, \"What does a conjunction do?\" The famous design dictum \"form follows function\" tells us that an object's design should reflect what it does.",
    "long": "Function is one of those words that gets used a lot and means lots of different things. It means what something does, but also what a person does, whether something or someone is doing what they should, and crazily enough, a big party. \"Your function is to bring the senator coffee at the political function. He cannot function without it.\""
  },
  "fret": {
    "short": "When you fret, you worry so much about something that it eats away at you. Many people fret about taking standardized tests, but really, they're nothing to sweat.",
    "long": "Fret comes from the Old English word freton which means to devour like an animal. When you fret over something, it consumes your thoughts. If you tell your mother to not fret about you while you're at a sleepover camp, you're telling her to not worry about you too much. Sometimes it means to be agitated though. When you're waiting for the results of an exam, you might fret and wring your hands. In a totally unrelated meaning, a guitar player calls the raised lines on the neck of the guitar that help him play  correctly frets."
  },
  "pique": {
    "short": "The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.",
    "long": "Both the noun and verb are pronounced \"pēk\" and were borrowed from a French word meaning \"a prick or irritation,\" from Old French piquer, \"to prick.\" So you can see how something that piques you could make you both excited and angry, perhaps even enough to storm away. That storming away, by the by, might be called a \"fit of pique.\""
  },
  "porous": {
    "short": "If something is full of tiny holes or openings, you can describe it as porous. A sponge is porous, and if the border between countries is open for anyone to cross easily, it too can be called porous.",
    "long": "You can see the word pore — meaning \"a tiny opening\" — in porous. When potters make a mug, they use special glazes to seal the porous clay, which otherwise would absorb the liquid you put in the mug. This meaning has expanded so porous can describe any barrier that allows easy passage in and out, like the porous border between two countries that allows residents to move easily between them."
  },
  "impart": {
    "short": "Let me impart a little bit of knowledge to you about the word impart. It means to pass on, transmit, or bestow. If you share this with your study partner, you are imparting your new wisdom.",
    "long": "Studying imparts confidence as well as information, long life imparts wisdom, and anise seed imparts the flavor of licorice. Your mother can impart the importance of dressing neatly each and every day. Though it shares a root with the word part, impart doesn't mean to split into pieces, but rather to divide or share with another. Let me impart this message to you — always do your part!"
  },
  "baneful": {
    "short": "Anything that's baneful is destructive or disastrous. The effects of wildfires can be baneful, causing the loss of people's homes, health, and even their lives.",
    "long": "The baneful effects of having an incredibly difficult math class at eight in the morning don't begin to compare to the baneful results of climate change. Still, feel free to use this archaic adjective for anything you consider to be extremely harmful. It comes from the noun bane and its Old English root, bana, which means not just \"killer, slayer, murderer,\" but also \"the devil.\""
  },
  "pebble": {
    "short": "Pebbles are the small, round stones you might find on a beach. If you want a pet rock, a smooth pebble would be a good choice.",
    "long": "A pebble beach might not be quite as soft underfoot as a sandy one, but pebbles tend to be smooth and rounded — unlike jagged-edged rocks. A beach covered with smooth pebbles is known as a \"shingle beach.\" The origin of the word pebble is a mystery, although some suspect a connection to the Latin papula, \"pustule, pimple, or swelling.\""
  },
  "acquiescence": {
    "short": "Acquiescence is an agreement, usually a willingness to go along with what someone else suggests. \"Sure, I don't mind,\" \"That sounds like a plan,\" and \"Good idea\" — these are all ways to show your acquiescence.",
    "long": "The word acquiescence, pronounced \"ack-we-ESS-sense,\" comes from the French word of the same spelling. The first record of its meaning as \"silent consent\" occurred in the 1640s. Acquiescence, in addition to \"agreement,\" can also mean \"acceptance without protest.\" Often when you offer acquiescence, you give in to another person's plan, perhaps because you are afraid to object or you don't have a better idea of your own."
  },
  "stigma": {
    "short": "If something has a negative association attached to it, call this a stigma. Bed-wetting can lead to a social stigma for a six-year-old, while chewing tobacco might have the same effect for a sixty-year-old.",
    "long": "Stigma, from the Greek word of the same spelling meaning \"mark, puncture,\" came into English through Latin to mean a mark burned into the skin to signify disgrace. It did not take long for stigma to be used figuratively, as it is commonly used today, for the negative stereotype or reputation attached to something. If a politician is caught taking bribes, she might resign because of the stigma."
  },
  "caterwaul": {
    "short": "A caterwaul is a yowl, shriek, or loud cry. If you've ever heard two cats fighting, you know what a caterwaul sounds like.",
    "long": "While a caterwaul can be made by a person, it's more likely the wailing sound that a distressed or fighting animal makes. To make this sound is to caterwaul — it's both a noun and verb. Cats are, in fact, the animal best known to caterwaul, and the word is believed to come from the German katerwaulen, \"cry like a cat,\" or possibly the Middle Dutch cater, \"tomcat,\" and Middle English waul, \"yowl.\""
  },
  "bellicose": {
    "short": "If you walk into a high school where you know no one, find the toughest looking girl in the halls and tell her she's ugly, them's fighting words. Or bellicose ones. Bellicose means eager for war.",
    "long": "Bellicose is from Latin bellum \"war.\" A near synonym is belligerent, from the same Latin noun. You may wonder if they're connected to the Latin bellus \"pretty, handsome,\" which gives us the names Bella or Isabella, as well as belle \"a beautiful woman.\" They're not. War and beauty are not related, except in the case of Helen of Troy."
  },
  "perspire": {
    "short": "To perspire is to sweat: to excrete perspiration through the pores in your skin.",
    "long": "Whenever little drops of moisture appear on your skin, you're perspiring or sweating. People sweat when they're nervous, when it's hot out, and when they're doing a lot of exercise. If you watch people playing a strenuous sport like basketball, they will be perspiring. Perspiring is one way your body cools itself off, so sweating is a good thing, even though it can make you feel gross. Some animals — like dogs — can't perspire, so it's harder for them to cool off."
  },
  "revise": {
    "short": "To revise means to alter or improve a preliminary draft of something, usually a text. When you want your writing to be really great, you must revise it several times until it is perfect.",
    "long": "The word revise sounds like the related word revisit, and revising a piece of work does in fact require revisiting it. Planning out a project includes estimating how much it will cost and when it will be done. If something unforeseen happens, you might have to revise your estimates of cost and completion date. You can also use revise as a noun. Once you finish the first draft of an essay, you can begin working on the revise."
  },
  "antediluvian": {
    "short": "Antediluvian means \"before the flood\" — that is, the Biblical flood with Noah's ark. Generally, though, the word is used — often humorously — to describe something really, really old.",
    "long": "In popular language, antediluvian is almost always used to exaggerate how comically, ridiculously old and out-of-date something is. You may laugh at your parents' antediluvian ideas of what's proper for going out on a date. And how about those antediluvian computers they still insist are fine! When the word was coined in the seventeenth century, however, it was meant literally. Back then, the science of reconstructing the Earth's history used the Bible as a frame of reference."
  },
  "novice": {
    "short": "If you're a novice at snowboarding, you're just learning the sport. On the Internet, a novice might be called a newbie, but your parents would call one a beginner.",
    "long": "Novice is derived from the Latin word novus, which means new. A novice is new to what they do, so a novice photographer is just learning how to take nice pictures. Other words related to novice are novel \"new, unusual,\" and innovate \"to invent, begin with new ideas.\" Novice can also mean a member of a Christian order who has not yet taken their vows."
  },
  "exultant": {
    "short": "Use the adjective exultant to describe the triumphant feeling you get when you succeed at something. The kids who win the Little League championship game will be exultant.",
    "long": "The kid who's elected sixth grade president will feel exultant, and so will a singer who's just given the performance of her lifetime. Exultant describes an excitement that's a combination of pride, happiness, and triumph. The word exultant comes from the Latin exsilire, \"to leap up,\" from the prefix ex-, \"up or out,\" plus salire, \"to leap.\" In other words, when you're exultant, you're jumping for joy."
  },
  "convert": {
    "short": "Think of the word convert as meaning \"change,\" whether it is a person who adopts a new belief, or a changing action, such as when you convert dollars into euros.",
    "long": "Many times we can catch a word's meaning by looking at its origins. In this case, the Latin con means \"around,\" while vertere means \"turn.\" So we can figure that convert means to \"turn around,\" an object or one's thoughts on an idea. For example, you might convert a meat eater into a vegetarian or an empty-nester might convert the kids' bedroom into an exercise room."
  },
  "daunting": {
    "short": "Something daunting can scare you off. If you have a lot of studying to do, it may seem like a daunting task. Good news is you can get through it by working hard. Or weasel out of it by playing sick.",
    "long": "Often used in the phrases “daunting prospect” and “daunting task,” daunting describes something that you are not looking forward to doing. Having to fill out complicated tax forms every year is a daunting task for many people. Once a daunting task is complete, you no longer describe it as daunting, but instead can call it a job well done, or at least another life experience survived."
  },
  "guarded": {
    "short": "Someone who's guarded is careful, restrained, and maybe a little bit wary. It's normal for a new rescue dog to be guarded when you first bring her home.",
    "long": "People tend to be guarded in certain situations — when they're being criticized, or are at a party where they don't know a single person. Others simply have guarded personalities, always starting from a position of cautiousness. Guarded can also literally mean \"protected,\" like a guarded castle, but you'll more often find it describing a restrained person."
  },
  "constant": {
    "short": "Think of something or someone that does not change as constant.  A classmate's constant drumming on the table with his fingers could be a constant source of annoyance.",
    "long": "Constant derives from Latin verb meaning \"to stand with,\" so something constant is continually standing with you and not wavering. You may be thankful for the constant companionship of your dog but not necessarily for your teacher's constant homework assignments. In math and science, a constant is a number that is fixed and known, unlike a variable which changes with the context. That idea crosses over to real life. If a friend is a constant in your life, that means they have always been with you and there for you."
  },
  "augury": {
    "short": "An augury is a sign of things to come, like an omen. If you’re superstitious, you might think that seeing a black cat is an augury of bad luck.",
    "long": "The word augury used to refer to a way of predicting the future by watching birds fly. These days, if a flock of birds flies over your car, that could simply be an augury that your car is going to be, um, decorated. Not every augury is an ill omen, but usually an augury is a sign that the future will be none too rosy. Auguries are signs of what's to come, and it's wise not to ignore them."
  },
  "missile": {
    "short": "A missile is an object that can be projected toward a target. Examples include a spitball shot through a straw, a poison-tipped arrow sent via bow, or a self-propelled heat-seeking rocket, designed to take out targets at long range.",
    "long": "When you learn about the Cuban Missile Crisis in history, the missiles in question were guided rockets loaded with nuclear warheads, supplied to the Cubans by the Soviet Union. A missile defense strategy is one where you send up defensive missile to blow up your enemy's offensive ones before they can reach you."
  },
  "plastic": {
    "short": "Plastic is a synthetic material that can be molded when soft and formed into a solid shape. Many toys are made out of plastic, like Barbie dolls and Lego blocks.",
    "long": "Plastic appears in many different forms, from beach balls to lawn chairs, grocery bags and much more. Credit cards, which are made of plastic, are called plastic, meaning payment that's not cash. You can also use plastic as an adjective to describe things that can be molded, like clay that's plastic in your hands, or to describe something that's artificial. For example, if a person is called plastic, he or she is probably fake or insincere."
  },
  "timorous": {
    "short": "A timorous person is timid or shy, like your timorous friend who likes to hang out with close pals but gets nervous around big groups of new people.",
    "long": "The adjective timorous is actually the Latin word for ”fearful.” But timorous is a specific kind of fearfulness — the kind that strikes people before giving a speech, or walking into a crowded place where people are socializing. Also called \"shy\" or \"timid,\" timorous people often become more comfortable when they see a familiar face in the crowd."
  },
  "bland": {
    "short": "When you have a nasty cold and you’re very congested, food can taste unappealingly bland. That means dull, flavorless, or just plain “blah.”",
    "long": "Bland comes to us from the Latin word blandus, meaning “mild, smooth, flattering, alluring.” Funny, because today you wouldn't say there's anything \"alluring\" about something bland. People still use bland to mean pleasant and tranquil, but it more often has a negative connotation. Use it to describe plain old oatmeal before you’ve added brown sugar and berries to it, or to depict the forgettable, uninteresting personality of the lunch lady who served it to you."
  },
  "quash": {
    "short": "Quash means to put down, stop, extinguish, and it’s usually used to talk about ideas, feelings, or political movements. You wouldn’t quash a grape underfoot; you would squash it. But if you were a military dictator, you would quash a revolution.",
    "long": "Quash is an extreme word. It comes from the French word for smash, or shatter. If something is quashed it is completely suppressed, usually by something or someone very powerful or authoritative. If you wrote a poem and asked your favorite teacher to read it, and that teacher tore it to pieces, then your hopes were most likely quashed."
  },
  "august": {
    "short": "August is not just the eighth month of the year; it also describes something esteemed or regal. The 200-year-old newspaper covering the royal wedding might be called an august institution.",
    "long": "The month August was named for Augustus Caesar who was an important and regal person. This is an easy way to remember the two meanings. Interestingly enough, linguists think that the word august did not descend from the same root as the month August. Find that hard to believe? August sources disagree. Oh, and don't forget to pronounce each word properly — the month has the accent on the first syllable, the adjective on the second."

  "supercilious": {
    "short": "Supercilious people think very highly of themselves, more highly than of others. If your sister tends to act snobby and superior, you can describe her as supercilious.",
    "long": "You might expect Nobel Prize winners to be supercilious — after all, they've reached the very heights of their profession. But one-on-one, your famous physics professor might be humble and fun to talk to, anything but supercilious. Most often, it's people who have no right to be arrogant, rude, and holier-than-thou who behave in the most supercilious ways. The Latin root supercilium means \"haughty demeanor,\" but also \"eyebrow\" — as in an eyebrow raised in a haughty, supercilious expression."
  },
  "clemency": {
    "short": "Say you're playing a role-playing game and you end up in one of the other player's dungeons.  You could try begging her for clemency — compassion shown by people in power towards people who rebel or break the law.",
    "long": "Clemency is also a weather word, though nowadays it's much more common to hear people talk about \"inclement weather\" than, say, \"the clemency of the storm.\" Derived from the Latin for \"gentle\", it came into usage in the 1550s. If you have trouble remembering its meaning, get rid of the \"cle\" and replace the \"n\" with an \"r\". You're left with \"mercy\", which more or less means the same thing."
  },
  "bog": {
    "short": "You'd be pretty soggy by morning if you accidentally set your tent up in a bog. A bog is a swampy kind of ground made up mostly of decomposing plants and mosses.",
    "long": "Nothing can be built on a bog because the ground is so spongy and damp, and no crops can be grown there. The dried soil from a bog can, however, be dried and burned for fuel. A figurative bog is anything that you tend to get stuck in, like a bog of health problems. Things can also \"bog you down\", or slow you down literally or figuratively, like when your homework bogs you down so you can't enjoy the weekend."
  },
  "exculpate": {
    "short": "To exculpate means to find someone not guilty of criminal charges. If you've been wrongly accused of robbery, you'd better hope a judge will exculpate you, unless you want to go to jail because you've heard prison food is amazing.",
    "long": "Exculpate comes from two Latin words: ex-, meaning \"from,\" and culpa, meaning \"blame.\" Exculpate is similar in meaning to exonerate. When you exonerate someone, you clear a person of an accusation and any suspicion that goes along with it. Exculpate usually refers more directly to clearing the charges against someone. So if that judge exculpates you from the robbery charge, everyone in town might still think you did it. Get him to exculpate and exonerate you."
  },
  "charisma": {
    "short": "Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley had great charisma, or a special personal charm or appeal that gave them influence or authority.",
    "long": "Charisma is often a quality possessed by successful politicians or leaders, or by other public figures. The corresponding adjective is charismatic, and it applies more to personality than appearance: a handsome and charismatic actor. Charisma was borrowed from a Greek word meaning \"favor, gift,\" from charizesthai, \"to favor,\" from charis, \"grace.\""
  },
  "bequest": {
    "short": "When you receive some kind of gift, be it money or property, through a will, that gift is known as a bequest.  Your aunt left you a bequest of the earrings she always thought you admired.",
    "long": "The noun bequest is something one arranges to give away after death, sort of a gift from beyond the grave.  Basically, putting a bequest in a will is a way of making sure the right person will get certain goods after your death. If you are very wealthy, universities and charitable organizations may court you in an attempt to gain bequests for their institutions."
  },
  "stoicism": {
    "short": "If you rarely show emotion or feeling, that’s stoicism. Your stoicism helps you endure physical or emotional discomfort without complaint, a helpful trait for long car trips with annoying people.",
    "long": "The noun stoicism, pronounced \"STOW-ih-siz-um,\" comes from Stoicism, the ancient Greek philosophical school, which taught that reason could overcome destructive emotions for a more virtuous life. Having great control over one’s emotions and responding calmly to misfortune are the marks of stoicism. If you take the good and the bad in stride without drama of any kind, your stoicism is admirable."
  },
  "ingenuous": {
    "short": "Someone who is ingenuous shows a childlike innocence, trust, and openness. One of the things kindergarten teachers value is the chance to work with kids while they're still relatively ingenuous — their open, trusting natures are a joy.",
    "long": "Ingenuous is roughly synonymous with naive, and its antonym is disingenuous, which means \"giving a false impression of being honest and sincere.\" Don't confuse the word ingenuous with the similarly spelled ingenious, which means \"very smart or clever.\" Ingenuous is from Latin ingenuus \"having the qualities of people born free, noble, honest, open.\""
  },
  "pliant": {
    "short": "The adjective pliant describes something that is capable of being bent. \"The teenager showed off her pliant spine every time she draped herself over a piece of furniture. Why hanging upside down off the sofa didn't give her a headache, her mother would never know.\"",
    "long": "Pliant has both a literal and a figurative meaning. Pliant can describe something that is bendable — like a spine, a tree branch, a bendy straw — or it can describe something that is flexible, but less tangible. In this latter sense, pliant describes something that adjusts to conditions or is easily influenced: \"In order to survive the recession, the company had to be pliant and adjust to the new economic conditions.\""
  },
  "effusive": {
    "short": "Getting a compliment from your effusive Aunt Sally can be a little embarrassing. Since she's so effusive, Aunt Sally holds nothing back, gushing with enthusiasm.",
    "long": "The adjective effusive means \"extravagantly demonstrative,\" and if you know someone who expresses positive emotions in a heartfelt, bubbly way, you understand just what the word means. The word effusive has a surprisingly similar definition in geology; it describes a particular kind of volcanic eruption, one in which lava bubbles up out of the volcano and flows around it."
  },
  "debrief": {
    "short": "When you debrief someone, you interview the person about an experience, project, or mission they've completed. A soldier's commanding officer might debrief her after a particularly difficult battle.",
    "long": "Spies and military personnel might expect their superiors to debrief them after a mission — the process is called a debriefing, and it includes questions about the experience and instructions about which details must be kept classified. Educators and counselors sometimes also debrief people, particularly those who have experienced tragedy or trauma, and who can be helped by talking through their experiences. The word debrief emerged at the end of World War II, originally as a military term."
  },
  "incubate": {
    "short": "When a chicken sits on an egg, it incubates it. To incubate means to keep something safe and warm so that it can grow.",
    "long": "The word can be used metaphorically to mean to keep something safe in order for it to have time to grow. You incubate a plan or an idea before bringing it into the world, or, metaphorically speaking, hatching it. Premature or particularly small babies are placed into an incubator when they are born. This warm, clean environment helps them to grow."
  },
  "stentorian": {
    "short": "The adjective stentorian describes a booming voice. If you're teaching a group of unruly kids, you'll need to practice a stentorian voice to be heard above the din.",
    "long": "The adjective stentorian comes from Greek mythology. Stentor was a herald in the Trojan War, mentioned in Homer's \"Iliad.\" Homer wrote of brazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. So anyone with a stentorian voice has a voice like the mythic Stentor. You can also use stentorian to describe a style of speaking that emphasizes boom and power."

    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "pretentious": {
    "short": "Use the adjective pretentious as a way to criticize people who try to act like they are more important or knowledgeable than they really are.",
    "long": "You might not be surprised to learn that pretentious is related to the word pretend, and it is an adjective that fits the bill for describing someone who's only concerned with making an impressive appearance. If you don't want to be accused of being pretentious, just act naturally and don't put on airs!"
  },
  "sybarite": {
    "short": "If you know someone who's totally addicted to luxurious things and all of life's pleasures, call her a sybarite. Unless she's inviting you over for champagne brunches and showering you with gifts — in which case you should keep your mouth shut.",
    "long": "Sybarite was first recorded in the 1600s, meaning a “person devoted to pleasure.” The literal translation of this noun is “inhabitant of Sybaris,” which was an ancient Greek town full of citizens who loved nice things. Today, the word still has the same two meanings: it's either a person who could be described as addicted to pleasures and luxury (like a hedonist), or an actual person who lives in Sybaris."
  },
  "refractory": {
    "short": "Imagine yourself pulling a dog who doesn't want to walk. The dog is refractory, or stubbornly resisting your authority.",
    "long": "The word refractory comes from a Latin word meaning \"obstinate\" and can also be used to mean \"not responsive to something.\" If you have a cold you can't shake, you could say you have a refractory cough. The word can also be used to describe a material that maintains its strength at very high heats. The outside of a space shuttle is made of refractory material, so that it can reenter the atmosphere without burning up."
  },
  "skittish": {
    "short": "If you're skittish, you're unpredictable and excitable. You've probably seen skittish horses in parades — the loud noises and crowds of people make them very nervous and jumpy.",
    "long": "The adjective skittish isn't just for animals — humans can be skittish too. If you're sleeping in a haunted house, for example, you're likely to be skittish, jumping at every moving shadow. Skittish can also mean flighty in thought — like your boss who's skittish about giving you a raise and avoids discussing it. The word is thought to have come from the Scandinavian word skyt, meaning \"very lively, frivolous.\""
  },
  "agony": {
    "short": "The noun agony means acute pain — either mental or physical, but people often use the word hyperbolically: \"This paper cut is agony.\"",
    "long": "The noun agony is also used in the common phrase \"the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat,\" which has been the tag-line of ABC's Wide World of Sports for decades. The catchphrase, in turn, is often rendered as a pun: \"He fell of the ladder and broke his foot. He writhed in agony from the pain, but the physical pain, was nothing compared to his mental agony when the doctor setting the bone joked, 'Now you know the agony of de feet!'\""
  },
  "applaud": {
    "short": "To applaud is to show approval, encouragement, or appreciation. You can applaud by clapping your hands at a performance, or you can applaud with just your mouth, as when you tell someone \"I applaud your decision to start exercising.\"",
    "long": "The verb applaud goes back to the Latin verb applaudere, \"to clap,\" and it came into English use in the 15th century. Part of the word applaud is laud, which means \"praise,\" and laud is close in spelling to loud. When you applaud, you give loud praise by clapping you hands together. If you really like what someone is doing and want to pat them on the back for it or show encouragement, you might just say \"I applaud your efforts.\""
  },
  "baleful": {
    "short": "Baleful means the foreshadowing of tragic or evil events. If no one's listening in class and your teacher reprimands you with a baleful glance, expect a pop quiz.",
    "long": "If your car breaks down and you take refuge in a deserted mansion, you might huddle under a dusty blanket and find yourself thinking that the wind moaning at the windows sounds baleful — maybe it's really the voice of a young woman murdered in the very bed where you sleep?"
  },
  "delineate": {
    "short": "Though you pronounce it duh-LIN-ee-ate, there is a \"line\" in the middle of delineate. This might help you remember that to delineate is to outline and define something in detail or with an actual marking of lines and boundaries.",
    "long": "When you create an outline for a paper it usually summarizes what you will detail later. You delineate the sections, or mark the heading lines, and when you write the details, you delineate the subject of each heading. So, to delineate is both to mark lines and to fill in the lines. Using a fence to divide properties or a carpet to claim your side of the bedroom also is a way to delineate, or mark, physical boundaries."
  },
  "ramification": {
    "short": "A ramification is an accidental consequence that complicates things. Remember that time you borrowed your father's car without asking? The ramification was that Dad missed an important meeting, his company went under, and he had to sell the car. Oops!",
    "long": "The ramifications are the broader effects that fan out into the world from one situation, or decision, that kicks it all off. Ramification also refers to something branching out, like limbs on a tree — which is what bad decisions tend to do. Ramification is like consequence, but usually unintended and bad. The word is often used in political discussions about laws or government decisions because they might be made locally but could affect people worldwide."
  },
  "impecunious": {
    "short": "If you are hard up, broke, penniless, or strapped for cash, you could describe yourself as impecunious. Then maybe you could make some money teaching vocabulary words.",
    "long": "Impecunious comes from the old Latin word for money, pecunia, combined with the prefix im, meaning not or without. But impecunious doesn’t just mean having no money. It means that you almost never have any money. If you go into the arts, you are most likely facing an impecunious future. If you gamble away your cash instead of saving it for rent, your landlord might throw you out for being impecunious."
  },
  "compliance": {
    "short": "Compliance is what you do when you try to fit standards set down by someone else. A restaurant chef's compliance with a new sugar-free menu might inspire even the pastry chefs to follow the recipes.",
    "long": "Plywood helps illustrate the \"pli\" in compliance, because if you've ever stepped on a piece of plywood stretched across something, you've felt how it gives underneath your feet. It has flexibility. Compliance means being flexible or yielding and giving in to a situation or order. \"Pliant\" is part of the word compliance, and it means yielding. Agreeing or bending to something like a plan, rule, or direction is compliance."
  },
  "pestilence": {
    "short": "Pestilence means a deadly and overwhelming disease that affects an entire community. The Black Plague, a disease that killed over thirty percent of Europe's population, was certainly a pestilence.",
    "long": "Pestilence is also one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the Book of Revelation (which is part of The Bible). When pestilence rides into town, you want to be somewhere far, far away. Whereas a person gets the flu, a nation experiences a pestilence. A disease that causes widespread crop damage or animal deaths can also be called a pestilence."
  },
  "tonic": {
    "short": "A tonic is something, sometimes a medicine, that makes you feel better or restores you to health. Before doctors prescribed drugs, crooked salesmen sold all sorts of dubious tonics.",
    "long": "Tonic was used to describe all sorts of concoctions that were supposed to make you feel better or livelier. Some helped and some didn’t. Coca Cola was originally marketed as a tonic — back when it is said to have contained cocaine as well as loads of caffeine. These days we might describe a weekend at the beach or a brisk walk as a tonic, meaning it will refresh you. Others might flee to a gin and tonic — an alcoholic drink."
  },
  "assail": {
    "short": "To assail is to attack or assault — with throwing stars, fists, words or, less tangibly but just as violently, with troubles or doubts.",
    "long": "Believe it or not, assail evolved from the ancient Latin word  assilire, which means \"to jump on.\" So picture an attacker jumping on you, throwing punches and maybe some insults, too. Because assail also means to ridicule or heap your worries upon someone. As novelist Charlotte Bronte noted, “Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last.” Think on that."
  },
  "annul": {
    "short": "When a celebrity wakes up in Las Vegas with a mysterious wedding ring on her finger, the first thing she’ll probably want to do is annul the marriage. That will declare it invalid and officially cancel the whole deal.",
    "long": "Annul, which means “to cancel” or “to invalidate,” is usually used in the context of politics or marriage. New government officials often want to annul laws and policies of the previous post-holder, effectively reversing their work. When you annul a marriage, you are officially declaring it invalid, as if it never happened. In the case of the unfortunate celebrity marriage, however, it could be difficult to completely erase all record of the event — especially if the tabloids hear about it."
  },
  "distend": {
    "short": "A soda and pizza binge might make your stomach distend, meaning your stomach will swell as a result of pressure from the inside.",
    "long": "If you’ve ever eaten too much food it won’t surprise you to learn that the verb distend traces back to the Latin words dis-, meaning “apart,” and tendere, meaning “to stretch.” Your stomach will certainly feel stretched out if you do something — like overeat — that causes it to distend. The word distend often applies to stomachs — a pregnancy would also cause a stomach to distend — but it can also refer to anything that is stretched out as a result of internal pressure."
  },
  "enhance": {
    "short": "Many people use the expression \"enhance your chance\" to point out ways to increase your chances of winning or earning a contest or prize. When you enhance something, you heighten it or make it better.",
    "long": "\"Hance\" is not a word, but the addition of \"en-\" does something to enhance it and improve its sound. You can enhance the size of something, too, by altering it or raising it, which is what the word original meant (the \"hance\" part came via French from Latin altus, meaning \"high\"). When you enhance something you take it to a higher level, like adding salt to French fries to enhance flavor or adding words to enhance your vocabulary."
  },
  "extempore": {
    "short": "Something extempore is spontaneous and unscripted. An extempore dance party on the city bus might be fun, while an extempore speech in front of the whole school could be terrifying.",
    "long": "The term exetempore comes from the Latin phrase ex tempore, \"out of time,\" and was originally used to mean \"without time to prepare.\" These days it usually comes up when a performer is improvising or a speaker goes off script or doesn't use a teleprompter: \"The President's extempore remarks made his advisors nervous.\" You can also use the synonym extemporaneous."
  },
  "taut": {
    "short": "Taut means tight rather than slack. The tightrope ought to be taut and not dangling down by the lion cage.",
    "long": "It sounds like the word \"taught\" and means stretched tight, like a rope, muscles, or even nerves. It's nice to have a taut body with tight muscles, but not so great to have a taut mind — tightly wound and tense. \"The Olympic gymnast's taut body was something she worked hard for, but she gave a taut reply to reporters who asked her so many questions about her past, which she wished to keep a secret.\" Taut is derived from an Old English word, meaning basically \"to pull.\" If you're fishing, you're happy when your line becomes taut, because there's probably a fish pulling at it. Or an old boot."
  },
  "ambivalence": {
    "short": "Someone who shows ambivalence about a person or thing has conflicting feelings. If you love your mom but find her totally embarrassing, you might feel ambivalent about having her give a presentation at your school.",
    "long": "Originally a psychological term, ambivalence was borrowed from the German word Ambivalenz, coined in 1910 by the Swiss psychologist Eugen Bleuler. The German word was formed from the Latin prefix ambi- \"in two ways\" plus Latin valentia \"vigor, strength.\""
  },
  "accuse": {
    "short": "If you charge someone with misdeeds or misconduct, you accuse that person. If the last piece of devil's food cake is missing, your sister may accuse you of eating it — especially if you have chocolate on your mouth.",
    "long": "The verb accuse comes from the Latin word accusare, which itself is formed from the roots ad, meaning toward, and causa, reason or lawsuit. \"Cause,\" \"excuse,\" and even \"ruse\" are all from that same root word. Today, if you're accused of a crime, you may still be headed toward a lawsuit. However, to accuse someone of a crime doesn't necessarily make them guilty — plenty of people have been falsely accused."
  },
  "stifle": {
    "short": "To stifle is to cut off, hold back, or smother. You may stifle your cough if you don't want to interrupt a lecture or you may stifle the competition if you fear losing.",
    "long": "The verb stifle means “to choke, suffocate, drown.” It can describe a claustrophobic feeling, like getting smothered by kisses from your great aunt. At its most extreme, stifle means to kill by cutting off respiration. The metaphoric sense of stifle didn’t develop until well after the word was first recorded as a verb: \"I can always tell — but never let on for fear of damaging his ego — that my boyfriend attempts to stifle tears during sappy parts of movies; his eyes well up at the corners and he’ll sniffle uncontrollably, claiming allergies.\""
  },
  "revamp": {
    "short": "If you revamp something, you renovate or remake it. You'll have to revamp your vacation plans if the hotel where you were planning to stay has closed for repairs and renovations.",
    "long": "The vamp of a shoe or boot is the front part that covers the top of the foot. If that part of your shoe needed repair or replacement, then you would have to revamp it. From this sense, we get the more common meaning of revamp — to restore or fix up. Your favorite hotel might be trying to revamp its image, to reinvent its reputation as a family resort."
  },
  "swift": {
    "short": "If you were the first one to reach the finish line in gym class, the coach might have called you swift. Swift means quick or fast-moving. A glance, a current, even a decision can be swift.",
    "long": "You can use the adjective swift to describe things that move or happen rapidly and smoothly. Deciding to borrow a parent's car without permission could result in swift punishment. Foxes are so swift that if you leave the chicken coop open for a moment, one might slip in. Conversely, if innuendo sails over your head, your friends might say, “You’re not too swift on the uptake, are you?” A swift is also a small bird that looks a lot like a swallow."
  },
  "controversial": {
    "short": "If a politician ran for office on the platform that children should be put to work from age six, his platform is likely to be controversial, meaning it will cause controversy, or a long discussion among people with opposing opinions.",
    "long": "Controversies are usually public disagreements about important matters. The adjective controversial is from the Latin from controversus \"disputed,\" formed from the prefix contra- \"against\" plus versus, from vertere \"to turn.\" The Latin suffix –ialis, corresponding to the English suffixes –ial and –al, means \"relating to or characterized by.\""
  },
  "console": {
    "short": "Perhaps you avoid babysitting your baby brother because you're worried that if he starts to cry, you won’t be able to console him or make him feel better. Or maybe you just hate changing diapers.",
    "long": "You usually try to console someone by providing encouragement and offering solace. Others try to console themselves with tubs of ice cream. From the Latin word consolari, meaning “to comfort,”  the noun console can also describe a central control panel. In an automobile, the controls for both the radio and air-conditioning are in the same center console."
  },
  "coup": {
    "short": "A coup is a pretty major achievement, whether it involves taking over a government by force, or landing a major business contract.",
    "long": "When the word coup is used on the nightly news, it's usually describing a military government takeover. In the business section of the daily newspaper,  coup might refer to a big corporation landing an important contract or deal. However you use the word coup, don't say the \"p\" at the end. It's not pronounced like chicken coop. It sounds more like a dove's coo."
  },
  "explicit": {
    "short": "Anything explicit is completely clear and includes details. If you don't want your little brother to become a snake snack, you'll need to give him explicit instructions for feeding your pet boa constrictor safely.",
    "long": "This adjective describes anything that is clear, detailed, and easy to understand. Explicit orders are easy to carry out, and explicit directions are easy to follow. When someone is explicit, they're not beating around the bush or being confusing. Explicit can also mean \"offensive\" or \"graphic,\" a description that is sometimes included in parental-advisory warnings about \"explicit language\" or \"explicit violence\" in movies."
  },
  "broach": {
    "short": "Broach means to bring up or introduce a sensitive issue. If your best friend has severe phobia of spiders, you might want to delicately broach the topic of your new pet tarantula, Mr. Fuzzy.",
    "long": "Let's say you want to go on vacation with a friend and you ask your dad because he is more likely to say yes. He will probably tell you that he will broach the subject with your mom and let you know. In a less common (and older) usage of broach, if you put a hole in something in order to get out what's inside you broach it. The piercing tool you use is also called a broach. Think of piercing someone with your idea the next time you broach a touchy issue."
  },
  "lustrous": {
    "short": "In shampoo commercials, the hair you see swinging is lustrous. It is brilliant, in the shiny sense.",
    "long": "Lustrous has its root in the Latin lustrare which means \"to illuminate or shine light over.\" When something is lustrous, it reflects light in a glossy and shiny way. A bright smile and a glowing reputation are both lustrous. If someone has a long and successful work history, you might say their career is illustrious, meaning it has been lustrous for a long time."
  },
  "stigmatize": {
    "short": "If you stigmatize someone, you have given that person a label — and it's usually a label that is limiting in some way.",
    "long": "In Ancient Greece, a stigma was a brand burned into a slave or a criminal's skin to symbolize disgrace. In the 1500s, the word stigmatize meant literally \"to brand or tattoo.\" Nowadays, to stigmatize is to shame or brand a person in a more symbolic way."
  },
  "deprivation": {
    "short": "A state of deprivation means something is missing, and the situation is serious. If you're suffering from sleep deprivation, you haven't slept in a long time.",
    "long": "If you know the word deprive — meaning to keep something away from someone — then you’re close to knowing what deprivation means. It describes the state of not having something. Poor people experience a lot of deprivation: poverty keeps them from having enough food or shelter. Plants experiencing water deprivation will shrivel up and die. If you’re grounded your parents might impose video game deprivation, although this word is usually reserved for when you’re lacking something really serious."
  },
  "terror": {
    "short": "Terror is the feeling of extreme fear. If you unexpectedly find someone dressed up as a vampire in your closet in the middle of a dark night, you might well experience feelings of terror.",
    "long": "If you feel terror, you are frozen to the spot in fear. This is the goal of terrorists who use terror as a weapon —  they create a climate of fear and mistrust so that people are afraid to go about their normal lives. You will recognize this use in the phrase “the war on terror.” You can also call a difficult  or scary person, often a child who causes havoc, a terror or a holy terror."
  },
  "obviate": {
    "short": "To obviate means to eliminate the need for something or to prevent something from happening. If you want to obviate the possibility of a roach infestation, clean your kitchen regularly.",
    "long": "The prefix ob means \"to go against.\"  That makes sense when you look at the words obstruct and obstacle, but how about obstetrics? Why does the name of the branch of medicine dealing with birth have the same root as words that mean \"stop\" or \"get in the way\"? Because a midwife stands opposite to, or against, the woman giving birth."
  },
  "esoteric": {
    "short": "Pssst... do you know the secret handshake? If you haven't been brought into the inner circle of those with special knowledge, esoteric things will remain a mystery to you.",
    "long": "In the olden days, achieving esoteric knowledge meant getting initiated into the mystical arts, learning secrets unknown to regular folks. Now when a subject is called esoteric it's usually something not so mystical but still hard to penetrate: financial accounting might seem esoteric for people who get easily stumped filling out their tax forms. Americans might find the sport of cricket to be esoteric, but the rules of baseball can be just as impenetrable to outsiders. The infield fly rule? Totally esoteric."
  },
  "sate": {
    "short": "Sometimes you're so hungry you feel like you could eat a ten-course meal. Other times it takes just a small salad to sate your appetite, or to satisfy your hunger.",
    "long": "The verb sate comes from the Old English sadian, “to satiate,” and can be applied to any situation regarding the satisfaction of a need or an appetite.  If you have been craving something sweet, your craving might be sated by a bag of jellybeans. However, if it seems like you can never get enough jellybeans, your appetite for sweets might be described as insatiable, a word used to describe a person or entity whose appetites — literally or figuratively — are impossible to satisfy."
  },
  "endear": {
    "short": "Things that endear you to others — like your sense of humor or your skill at baking chocolate chip cookies — cause them to be fond of you.",
    "long": "The verb endear is almost always followed by the word \"to,\" as in the sentence \"The teacher's ready smile and gentle voice endear him to the class of kindergartners.\" When something endears you to another person, he or she adores you. In the 1500s, endear meant \"increase the value of,\" though it quickly came to mean \"make dear,\" or perhaps to increase the emotional value, especially of another person."
  },
  "exalt": {
    "short": "You might like your manager, but if you exalt her, it means you really put her on a pedestal and treat her like royalty.",
    "long": "To exalt is to hold or raise someone up to a high position or status. It doesn't have to mean literally putting that person into a high position, but instead treating them almost like nobility. Overly doting parents exalt their infant to the point where they praise him every time he wets his diaper and call the neighbors over every time he coos."
  },
  "surreptitious": {
    "short": "When someone behaves in a surreptitious way, they're being secretive. They're doing something that they don't want to be seen doing.",
    "long": "While surreptitious means secret, it has the added sense of \"sneaky\" or \"hidden.\" During the Jewish Passover meal of Seder, an adult will surreptitiously place a piece of matzoh somewhere in the house for the children to hunt for later in the meal. You'll see surreptitious applied mostly to actions, rather than to things or ideas. We do things surreptitiously. The members of the secret society hold surreptitious meetings because, well, they're a secret society. I was very surreptitious in how I organized the surprise party: she never knew!"
  },
  "retreat": {
    "short": "The noun retreat means a place you can go to be alone, to get away from it all. A spot under a shady tree might be your favorite retreat from the sun, or your bedroom in the basement may serve as a retreat from your siblings.",
    "long": "In the military sense, the noun retreat means the withdrawal of troops. The British retreat after the Battles of Lexington and Concord gave the American colonists an early taste of victory during the American Revolution. As a verb, retreat means to back out of something — like a lawyer who is forced to retreat from his argument when the opposing evidence is too convincing."
  },
  "vestige": {
    "short": "A vestige is a trace or reminder of something that has disappeared or is disappearing. A lump of snow with a carrot in it might be the vestige of a snowman.",
    "long": "Vestige derives from the Latin vestigium, \"footprint,\" and that is a good way to think of it — as a little hint of what was there before. It's something left behind, like a puddle after a heavy rainstorm. Sometimes vestige is used to emphasize a small amount; for example, you might say that the robber didn't show even a vestige of remorse after he was caught."
  },
  "lambent": {
    "short": "Lambent is a word describing a type of light that is subdued or soft. A lambent glow is not a bright, blinding light.",
    "long": "Lambent comes from a Latin word meaning \"lick,\" and that fact may help you remember the word: lambent lights or flames aren't solid or powerful. The light is flickering — almost like the licking of a snake's tongue. Lambent light flickers or shines softly. It's not a powerful or overwhelming light. A candle in a dark room is a great example of a lambent light. Lambent light is better for setting a mood than lighting up a room brightly."
  },
  "jejune": {
    "short": "Use the adjective jejune to describe something that is uninteresting or insignificant. Many people claim to find celebrity gossip jejune, but ask them about a recent movie star scandal and chances are they know all about it.",
    "long": "Jejune can also describe something that’s immature or simplistic. All that actress could say about her latest movie was that it was “Super fun”? That’s a pretty jejune comment. Basically jejune means lacking substance. It originally comes from the Latin word jejunus, which means “fasting,” so when something is jejune, it’s figuratively empty — devoid of intellectual nourishment."

  "clear-cut": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "bizarre": {
    "short": "Someone or something bizarre is odd or unusual in appearance, style, or character. If your teacher walks into class wearing a purple boa, lime-green cowboy boots, and a scuba mask, you might comment, \"How bizarre!\"",
    "long": "Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected elements. Bizarre was borrowed from French, from bizarro \"angry, fierce, strange,\" from Spanish, \"bold, like a knight.\" The Spanish word was probably influenced by Basque bizar \"a beard,\" since beards were taken as signs of energy and spirit. Nowadays it takes more than a beard to get you labeled as bizarre. Unpredictable behavior is often called bizarre — like when your little brother decides that he will communicate only in Pig Latin."
  },
  "legitimate": {
    "short": "Something legitimate is the real deal — according to the law.",
    "long": "Legitimate has other variations of meaning. To legitimate something is to make it legal, either by passing a law or publicly recognizing it as in accordance with the law. A government can be legitimized by being invited to world talks, or a movie by winning a prestigious award."
  },
  "malodorous": {
    "short": "You can use the adjective malodorous as a nicer way to say that something's stinky. Maybe you think your feet smell like roses, but if people move far away when your shoes come off, your rosy feet are probably malodorous.",
    "long": "Mal- is used to form words for bad things, and in this case, mal-odor-ous means having a bad odor. Synonyms for malodorous include \"smelly,\" \"rank,\" and \"funky\" — but not funky in a \"get on with your bad self\" good way, just funky bad. If you walk into a malodorous room, you might start checking the bottoms of your shoes to see if you stepped in something, and if a plate of malodorous food is served, you might cover your nose and mouth."
  },
  "peregrinate": {
    "short": "People who peregrinate are constantly on the move, traveling from one location to another. You might peregrinate from Italy to Spain to France during your European backpacking trip.",
    "long": "The most common way to peregrinate is on foot, wandering from place to place, as when you decide to peregrinate around your city's various neighborhoods pretending you're a tourist. The word is a bit old fashioned these days, and it was first used in the late 16th century, taken from the Latin peregrinatus, \"traveled abroad,\" or figuratively \"wandered or roamed,\" from peregrinus, \"foreign.\""
  },
  "supplant": {
    "short": "Kate was out sick for a month with mono, and when she came back to school, Jessie had supplanted her as the funny girl at the lunch table. Supplant means to take the place of.",
    "long": "Being supplanted is something that often happens to ideas or ways of thinking. Encouraging children's freedom has supplanted old ideas about children being better seen than heard. After a shocking upset at Wimbledon, a new tennis player has supplanted the reigning champion."
  },
  "ascendancy": {
    "short": "When you assume ascendancy over someone else, you become more powerful than they are. Ascendancy is the state of being in a higher position.",
    "long": "If you look at ascendancy, you see the word, ascend, which means to go up. Ascendancy is not so much about going up, but about being up. Another word for it is dominance, especially in the context of foreign or domestic relations. In school, if you question a teacher's ascendancy, you might be told to go to the principal's office. In this case, you're challenging the teacher's authority."
  },
  "copious": {
    "short": "If you have a copious amount of something, you have a lot of it. If you take copious notes, you'll do well when it comes time for review sessions — unless you can't read your own handwriting.",
    "long": "Copious comes from the Latin copia, meaning \"abundance.\" You can use copious for something quantitative, like your copious admirers, or for something qualitative, like the copious gratitude you feel for your admirers. You will often see the word amounts following copious since the adjective is often used to modify a measurement of something — like copious amounts of wine or copious amounts of hair gel."
  },
  "iniquitous": {
    "short": "Something that is iniquitous is extremely immoral or wicked, such as an iniquitous political regime that assassinates its enemies.",
    "long": "Use the adjective iniquitous to describe something that is truly bad, morally wrong, extremely wicked, or completely unfair. It’s a strong word — don't use it lightly. If you go see a movie that’s boring and too long, for example, it’s just a bad movie. But a movie that encourages people to take violent action against a minority group? That's iniquitous because the movie's message is grossly immoral."
  },
  "inculcate": {
    "short": "To inculcate is to teach through frequent instruction. If you repeatedly tell your brother how important it is to be responsible, then you’re trying to inculcate in him a sense of responsibility.",
    "long": "The word inculcate traces back to the Latin word inculcare, meaning “to force upon or to stamp in.” If anyone has even tried to inculcate you with something, it may seem as if something is being stamped into your brain — over and over and over. A key thing to remember about this word is repetition: something, such as a value or a belief, is instilled in the brain by the persistent restating of its importance."
  },
  "commentator": {
    "short": "A person who analyzes and discusses topics in politics and sports is called a commentator. If you want to hear opinions on the news rather than the news itself, listen to commentators.",
    "long": "A reporter delivers the news and a commentator analyzes it, sometimes within the same news program. If you're a top sports commentator, you may become an even bigger household name than the players you are discussing, and you may pull in just as much money too. Political commentators, who often offer more opinion rather than analysis, are also sometimes called pundits or talking heads."
  },
  "dignity": {
    "short": "If someone has dignity, it means they are worthy of respect. If you really want the lead role in a play and you try to bribe the director to give it to you, she might say, “Have you no dignity?”",
    "long": "Someone with dignity carries herself well. If you lose an election, and you say nasty things about your opponent and try to undermine her, you are acting without dignity. But if you graciously congratulate her and accept the results, then you are behaving in a dignified manner. We also talk about human dignity, which is an idea of what separates humans from animals. Human Rights activists believe that everyone has the right to live with dignity."
  },
  "timid": {
    "short": "Timid means \"overly cautious or fearful,\" like a timid driver who drives very slowly or avoids highways altogether.",
    "long": "Timid comes from the Middle French word timide, meaning \"easily frightened, shy.\" Those who are timid often worry that things will go wrong: a timid eater orders bland food to avoid the possibility not liking the flavor of something new, just as a timid partygoer talks to people he already knows, afraid that he won't be able to talk to strangers."
  },
  "covet": {
    "short": "If you covet something, you eagerly desire something that someone else has. If it's 95 degrees out and humid, you may find yourself coveting your neighbor's air conditioner.",
    "long": "If the word covet sounds familiar, you're thinking of the Tenth Commandment: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.\" Basically this means you should be happy with your electronic gadgets and not be jealous when a friend gets something better."
  },
  "leaven": {
    "short": "Leaven, as a noun, is that which causes transformation. It’s the source of yeast that makes your bread rise, it’s the risen bread, and it’s anything that changes the nature of something else.",
    "long": "Coming through Old French from the Latin verb levare, which means “to raise,” leaven changes everything. It makes dough go from flat to loaf, and it’s also the term to describe the risen dough before it’s baked. And leaven can be anything that causes transformation — \"Winning the lottery will be the leaven that allows you to travel the world.\" Additionally it’s a verb: \"When you bake bread, you leaven the dough to make it rise.\""
  },
  "brevity": {
    "short": "The noun brevity means shortness or conciseness. If you give a report on agriculture in the northern hemisphere in 3 minutes, you have done it with incredible brevity.",
    "long": "Brevity comes from brevis, which means \"brief\" in Latin. You can use brevity for things that are literally short, like the brevity of an elevator meeting, or the quality of fleetingness, like the brevity of youth. Brevity is also a style of speaking or writing with economy. \"Brevity is the soul of wit,\" remarks Polonius in Shakespeare's Hamlet, suggesting that witty people know how to make a point without unnecessary words."
  },
  "overt": {
    "short": "Overt means open and done in plain sight. An overt demand for an increase in your allowance probably won't work; instead, try praising your parents' generosity and dropping hints about how high prices are these days.",
    "long": "If you speak French, remember that overt is the same as the French ouvert \"open.\" If you don't speak French, give up all hope of ever learning this word. Just kidding — forgive the overt attempt at humor. English speakers, here's your trick for remembering the difference between overt and covert: overt = \"open\"; covert = \"covered.\""
  },
  "pulchritudinous": {
    "short": "Even though it looks (and sounds) like it would describe a disease or a bad attitude, pulchritudinous actually describes a person of breathtaking, heartbreaking...beauty.",
    "long": "Let's be honest: Your opportunities for using this word in casual conversation are probably pretty slim. But, just in case, let's do a quick run-down on the pronunciation: Pulchritudinous: \"pul-kruh-TOO-di-nuhs.\" And one last note about this 15-letter, 5-syllable beast (which may win the award for least-beautiful word meaning \"beautiful\"): It's only used to describe people."
  },
  "virtuosity": {
    "short": "Use the noun virtuosity to describe an impressive skill, such as a classical musician's virtuosity at playing the cello.",
    "long": "Lots of people have talents, but only a select few, called virtuosos, have the superior quality of virtuosity. A piano virtuoso, for example, is able to play and improvise at the highest level possible. People can also display virtuosity in speaking, in writing computer code, in cooking, or in other skills. In the late fifteenth century, virtuosity specifically meant \"manly qualities,\" from the Latin root virtutem, \"manliness, valor, or excellence.\""
  },
  "optometrist": {
    "short": "An optometrist specializes in testing the eyes and helping correct vision with glasses or contact lenses. If you can’t read anything below the giant E on the doctor's wall chart, don’t worry: an optometrist can help improve how you see.",
    "long": "Words starting with \"opto-\" are related to vision, and an optometrist is trained in finding problems with the eyes and recommending treatment or correction. \"Optometry\" is the science of studying the eyes or vision, and an optometrist is specialized in this study. Two words that are sometimes confused are optometrist and \"optician.\" While an optometrist is someone who examines and treats the eyes, an \"optician\" works with the optometrist to make the corrective glasses or contact lenses a patient needs."
  },
  "impervious": {
    "short": "An impervious surface is one that can't be penetrated. The word is often followed by \"to,\" as in \"His steely personality made him impervious to jokes about his awful haircut.\"",
    "long": "Most of the sentences you'll run across using impervious will be followed by the word \"to\" and a noun. Things are often described as being impervious to physical assaults like heat, water, bullets, weather, and attack, but just as frequently to less tangible things, like reason, criticism, pain, and pressure. The word comes from Latin: in- + pervius, meaning \"not letting things through.\" A common synonym is impermeable."
  },
  "demonstrative": {
    "short": "People who are demonstrative easily and clearly show their emotions. A demonstrative person might shout \"Hooray\" and jump for joy at good news. A non-demonstrative person might feel no less excited, but refrain from demonstrating it.",
    "long": "To demonstrate means to show, so think of demonstrative as showing. In legal terms, demonstrative is used to describe evidence that shows that something happened––a note that says \"I did it\" might show, or demonstrate, an accused person's guilt. In grammar, demonstrative pronouns––this, that, these, those––indicate the thing or person that is being pointed out, or shown, as in “Officer, it was ‘that’ man who stole my purse!”"
  },
  "horrific": {
    "short": "Something horrific causes horror. It’s disastrous and makes you shudder with fear. Yikes!",
    "long": "If something horrific, like a deadly car crash, makes your hair stand up, you’re onto something. Horrific comes from the Latin word horrificus — which, if you trace it back, literally means “making the hair stand on end.” Anything horrific fills you with horror and makes you bristle. If you lose your hat, that’s a bummer. A serial killer’s rampage? That's horrific. Save horrific for things that are so scary your hair stands up, or feels like it is."
  },
  "penalty": {
    "short": "A penalty is a punishment or consequence for doing something wrong, such as having to pay a fee for not bringing your library book back when it was due.",
    "long": "In hockey, players who break the rules have to sit in \"the penalty box.\" Just like the penalty box punishes hockey players, all penalties are punishments for doing something wrong. Going to prison is the penalty for serious crimes. Detention is the penalty for misbehaving in school. Often, penalty applies to payments people have to make for breaking a financial contract of some kind."
  },
  "rapacious": {
    "short": "Something rapacious is out to devour — anything, and little can stand in its way. A rapacious landlord is out for more rent, and a rapacious eater is only satisfied at the all-you-can-eat buffet.",
    "long": "A 17th-century word, from the Latin rapere, \"to snatch,\" rapacious originally described the people and animals who often preyed on weaker creatures and devoured them, by eating them or by ruining them through some scandal. Modern-day companies even get the label rapacious when their appetites for profit seem to devour \"lesser\" interests, like the environment and employee benefits."
  },
  "veracity": {
    "short": "Veracity sounds like some kind of disease you don't want to catch, but in fact, it means truthfulness. If you question the veracity of a statement or story, you wonder whether it is truthful or accurate.",
    "long": "Veracity is linked to the adjective veracious or \"truthful.\" But don't confuse veracious with voracious. A voracious person eats very large amounts of food. If you were veracious, or \"truthful,\" you'd tell them they look fat."
  },
  "quixotic": {
    "short": "Use quixotic for someone or something that is romantic and unrealistic, or possessed by almost impossible hopes. Your quixotic task is easy to understand, if difficult to achieve: establish world peace.",
    "long": "What a wonderful word quixotic is! While it is most often used to mean equally impractical and idealistic, it also has the sense of romantic nobility. Its source is from the great Spanish novel \"Don Quixote,\" whose title character is given to unrealistic schemes and great chivalry. In the middle of a recession and high unemployment, it would be quixotic to imagine that you could quit your job and find another easily."
  },
  "cower": {
    "short": "To cower is to shrink in fear. Whether they live in the country or city, any mouse will cower when a huge, hungry cat approaches.",
    "long": "When you cower, you're not just afraid. You're so terrified that your whole body cringes, crouches, and shrinks in on itself to hide from the source of your fear. Victims of a school bully might cower whenever he comes near, and a law-breaking peasant might cower when brought before a cruel king. Although a coward might cower in fear, the two words aren't related."
  },
  "coffer": {
    "short": "A coffer is a small safe or lockbox that's meant for keeping precious or valuable items safe. Your grandfather might keep his important papers in a coffer in his study.",
    "long": "You can keep your heirlooms, jewels, and savings bonds in a coffer, a safe chest for tucking such things safely away. Coffer takes on a figurative meaning when you talk about the coffers of a large institution: \"There's plenty of money in the government coffers — they just don't want to spend it on education!\" Yet another meaning of the word is \"decorative sunken panel in a ceiling,\" such as one you'd see in a mosque, museum, or cathedral ceiling."
  },
  "illusory": {
    "short": "If something is based on something that is not real, you can say it is illusory. Tales of seeing Elvis and Big Foot eating together at McDonalds are probably based on an illusory experience.",
    "long": "Although the adjective illusory can describe anything that's based on an illusion, it often has the negative connotation of being deliberately deceptive. Like a bogus investment scheme that seems to make money for investors: any real profits are totally illusory. Or the illusory claims that fad diets work — they only work while you're on the diet, and no one can survive on cabbage soup forever."
  },
  "hyperbole": {
    "short": "Praising your favorite sports team is one thing, but if you call the team the most incredible group of humans ever to walk the earth, then you're going overboard and indulging in hyperbole.",
    "long": "The hyper- in hyperbole means \"beyond,\" so it's a good sign that the word has to do with going above and beyond what's necessary. Someone who gets hyperactive about something and ends up hyperventilating (breathing too hard) might be prone to the exaggerated style of speaking known as hyperbole. If you find yourself talking about the absolutely best (or worst) thing of all time, it's time to take it down a notch and cut down on the hyperbole."
  },
  "tangible": {
    "short": "When you can touch something, it's tangible: \"I need tangible proof that aliens exist — I want to shake their little green hands!\"",
    "long": "Tangible is from Latin tangere, \"to touch,\" and it simply means something that can be touched or felt, though it can be used in metaphorical senses: tangible assets have a value that can be precisely measured, and tangible grief can be clearly sensed by an onlooker. So you might not need to physically touch something for it to be tangible, but it has to be grounded in the real world of facts: \"Has the teen pop star demonstrated any tangible ability to sing?\""
  },
  "cretin": {
    "short": "The English language has no shortage of cruel names for people, and one of them is cretin, which is what you’d call someone who is very, very dumb in the head.",
    "long": "Back before cretin meant “a stupid person,” it was a medical term for a physical deformity that came from a specific disease.  Surprisingly, the root of cretin is the Swiss French word crestin, which means “Christian.”  It seems that people back then wanted to remind themselves that even though cretins look unusual, they’re still humans who deserve kindness.  Knowing this makes it hard to use cretin in a mean way, but there are plenty more rude words you could use."
  },
  "inveigle": {
    "short": "When you tell your boyfriend he’s not just the best boyfriend ever but also the world's best driver, and this makes him offer to drive the whole way on your upcoming road trip, then congratulations. You know how to inveigle, or use charm to coax someone into doing something.",
    "long": "If you successfully inveigle your sister to doing something for you, she must be so caught up in your flattering that she is blind to your true intention. In fact, inveigle comes from the Middle French word aveugler, meaning “delude, make blind,” which can be traced back to the Medieval Latin word ab oculis, or “lacking eyes.” The people you inveigle don't see what you are really up to."
  },
  "suborn": {
    "short": "One of the reasons Mafia bosses are so good at avoiding prison is that they know how to suborn witnesses and jurors — that is, to bribe people to lie. After all, it wouldn't be nice if an accident were to happen on the way to court, right?",
    "long": "Technically speaking, suborn doesn't just mean induce someone to conveniently \"forget\" something in the witness stand, or otherwise get creative with their imagination. An inducement to any kind of crime is suborning, but by far the most common use is in the legal sense above. Or \"witness tampering,\" as the cops call it."
  },
  "usurp": {
    "short": "If you take over your neighbor's backyard and claim his in-ground swimming pool as your own, you might seize control of, or usurp his yard, but he'll probably call the cops on you.",
    "long": "Leaders who usurp power don't ask for permission to take control of their country. They seize power, often with the help of a large army of followers. A usurper doesn't have to be human. A brand-new radio station can usurp the most popular station in town by playing a better mix of music."
  },
  "foundation": {
    "short": "A foundation is the base for something. You often hear about the structural foundations of buildings, but a good idea can also be the foundation of a successful business.",
    "long": "In the simplest sense, foundations support something else. Friendship is the foundation of a good marriage, and many svelte figures rely on girdles (known to underwear specialists as a foundation garment). But foundations are also charitable organizations. And in cosmetics, foundation is gooey make-up that's supposed to match your skin tone."
  },
  "redundant": {
    "short": "The word redundant applies to things that are unnecessary or could be left out. Calling a blank sheet of paper empty is redundant.",
    "long": "Teachers often tell students to avoid being redundant — meaning avoid saying something twice or more. Have you ever heard someone tell a story and repeat the same thing over and over? The repeated parts are redundant. Sometimes being redundant can make things clear, but it can also be annoying. Redundant can apply to anything that's overflowing or unnecessary. If a business has two stores on the same street, one is redundant. When you hear redundant, think \"Too much!\""
  },
  "orifice": {
    "short": "An orifice is an opening or a hole, most often in the body, such as your mouth or your nostril.",
    "long": "We most often use orifice to describe a natural opening in our bodies, but it can an opening into any cavity, such as a hollowed out tree trunk, or the vent of a heating system. Other definitions of orifice include a type of nozzle used in plumbing applications and a plate used to measure the flow of liquid."
  },
  "reversible": {
    "short": "A sweater designed to be worn right-side-out and inside-out is reversible. The health effects of a cold are reversible, too. Reversible means able to be undone or able to be used inside-out.",
    "long": "The great thing about reversible clothes is that it's like getting two pieces for the price of one. The great thing about reversible damage is that it can be fixed. Damage that can't be fixed is called irreversible, but t-shirts meant to be worn only one way are simply called t-shirts."
  },
  "incisive": {
    "short": "The adjective incisive describes something that is sharp, decisive, and direct. A comment that cuts right to the bone can be just as incisive as an actual knife.",
    "long": "The word incisive is rooted in a Latin word that literally means \"to cut with a sharp edge.\" To help you remember the meaning, you can think of the similar word, incisors, which are the teeth that are sharp and cut and tear. The more figurative meaning of describing something that is mentally sharp first appeared in the 1850s. Keen criticism and cutting remarks have been called incisive ever since."
  },
  "moat": {
    "short": "Not many houses these days have a moat — it's a trench dug outside a castle and is usually full of water. A moat means \"Keep out!\"",
    "long": "You're most likely to hear about moats if you read a fairy tale or a history of medieval times. This water-filled ditch is one of the lines of defense for a castle. In the old days, it was pretty effective. If you filled the moat with a deadly fish — like a piranha — that was an even better defense. A moat is pretty much the opposite of a welcome mat."
  },
  "parochial": {
    "short": "If an issue or a matter is parochial, it is trivial or only concerns a local area. Likewise, a person with a parochial mentality is narrow-minded, or not open to new ideas.",
    "long": "Parochial comes to English from Greek through Latin with the meaning \"of a parish.\" As a parochial school is a school that is affiliated with a particular church, the connection is easy to see. In general though, parochial refers to a narrow or limited point of view — that is, an outlook that extends no further than the limits of the parish. You may feel that there is no room in your life for the parochial attitudes of the older generation. Let's hope you remain open-minded as you age!"
  },
  "castigation": {
    "short": "If your coach yells at your team for sloppy play, her post-game speech might be called a castigation. A castigation is a harsh verbal reprimand.",
    "long": "No one likes to be on the receiving end of castigation. The word comes from the Latin castigus which means \"to make pure.\" Try to remember during castigation that the castigator is, in their own misguided way, trying to make you a better person. But that may be hard to think of when someone is bawling you out."
  },
  "tremor": {
    "short": "A tremor is a trembling or shaking in a person or the Earth. If you're scared about speaking in public you might have a tremor in your voice — or wish that an earthquake tremor would open up the floor and swallow you first.",
    "long": "If you're nervous or feeling queasy as you read a paper aloud, you might get a tremor in your hands and the paper itself will start to shake. When an earthquake rumbles, a powerful tremor might make a building shake so that it looks as fragile as a piece of paper. Not every tremor comes from fear or seismic activity, though: you can tremor or quiver with excitement as you anticipate something enjoyable."
  },
  "shunt": {
    "short": "A shunt is a small tube that goes inside the body to drain fluid. It also means to divert in a general way, like if you shunt the thought of tubes in your body, you think about rainbows and kittens instead.",
    "long": "Although shunt usually refers to a tube that drains blood or other fluid out of a part of the body, shunt also means to bypass. If a train is shunted, it’s diverted from the main track onto a side track. The word may have come from shun, as in “turn away,” which is what a shunt essentially does. It turns something away from where it was headed."
  },
  "sound": {
    "short": "A sound is a noise, something you can hear if you're in the right spot and it's loud enough. A doorbell, a fire alarm, a cat's meow, or your brother's snoring — they’re all sounds.",
    "long": "Long Island Sound is another kind of sound — it’s a branch of the Atlantic Ocean that runs between Connecticut and Long Island, New York. When you don’t know a word, you might sound out the syllables — say them aloud — to figure out the pronunciation. Sound can also mean \"solid or good.\" Sound advice is good advice. Sound investments are secure. When you have a sound sleep, it's restful and uninterrupted — at least until your alarm sounds."

  "peculiar": {
    "short": "Something peculiar is notably unusual. If your friend starts saying strange things you don't understand, ask her why she's suddenly become peculiar.",
    "long": "Peculiar comes from the Latin peculiaris, meaning one's own, or personal.  In English, it originally meant belonging to one person, private, like your fondness for your peculiar hairbrush.  It also had the meaning of something unlike others, special, or remarkable. Eventually we mostly stopped using it for belongings,  instead using peculiar to mean unusual or odd."
  },
  "jeer": {
    "short": "As a noun, jeer is the act of scoffing, taunting, or mocking. Think of it as an anti-cheer.  If you offer cheers for the visiting team and jeers for the home team, you might not be too popular in the stands.",
    "long": "As a verb, jeer means to laugh at in a mean way.  Even if you did forget the words to the national anthem, it wasn't polite for the crowd to jeer.  But don't feel too bad: the last singer remembered all the words and they jeered her anyway!  Tough crowd."
  },
  "expurgate": {
    "short": "To expurgate is to censor. Usually, people talk about expurgating bad words from something written or on TV.",
    "long": "On TV, if you hear some words bleeped out, those words have been expurgated. In print, we can expurgate by using dashes ( —  — ) or random characters like %&$#. Sometimes we can expurgate just by rewriting something so that the entire sentence with the naughty parts is gone, or by putting it into mild words. When it comes to things children read or watch, there's often the difficult question of what to expurgate and what to leave alone."
  },
  "nonplussed": {
    "short": "If a conversation with someone leaves you scratching your head and wondering what point they were trying to make, you are nonplussed: bewildered, puzzled, often speechless.",
    "long": "Interestingly, there is no word plussed. You can only be nonplussed. People are nonplussed when they’re astounded, exasperated, or at a loss. \"I'm nonplussed,\" you say when your mother tells you she's marrying her 25-year-old personal trainer. \"I'm nonplussed,\" you say when your boss fires you, even though he tells you you’re the best employee he's ever had. Since so many things are confusing and odd, there’s a lot in life that can leave you nonplussed."
  },
  "chasm": {
    "short": "A chasm is a deep divide, either literal or figurative, such as a giant chasm in an ice cap or the growing chasm between two friends who haven't spoken in a long time.",
    "long": "The first syllable in chasm sounds like cat without the t sound: \"CA-zum.\" It comes from the Greek word khasma, meaning \"yawning hollow, gulf\" and was originally used to describe a split in a land formation, such as a deep crack caused by an earthquake. The word still retains that sense, but today can also mean \"a profound division between people or beliefs,\" such as a chasm between Republicans and Democrats."
  },
  "nincompoop": {
    "short": "Calling someone a nincompoop is like calling them a fool, idiot, bonehead, or dope. It's definitely not a compliment.",
    "long": "Nincompoop is a silly-sounding word that's also kind of old-fashioned, like ninny. No one has any solid idea where it came from, and anyone who claims otherwise is, well, a nincompoop. By definition, nincompoops are dumb, foolish, and can't do anything right. But there are far worse things you could call someone who's behaving like an idiot. Maybe this old-timey insult deserves a revival?"
  },
  "serpentine": {
    "short": "You can use the adjective serpentine to describe things that look like a serpent or are snakelike. Looking down at the carved riverbeds in the Grand Canyon is like looking into a basket of snakes: the serpentine twists curve throughout the canyon floor.",
    "long": "Not everyone likes snakes, but those who aren’t grossed out by the highly flexible bodies of serpents might enjoy using the word serpentine for things that resemble their snaky, curvy lines. Strands of hair, cracks in dry desert, and roller-coaster rides can look serpentine, and you might tangle with a serpentine hose while minding your own business and watering the plants. Sometimes serpentine even describes people who are snakelike or slippery in character."
  },
  "disrupt": {
    "short": "To disrupt is to interrupt or throw something into disorder. If you don't turn your phone off before a play, it might ring and disrupt the actors and the audience.",
    "long": "Disrupt goes back to the Latin root disrumpere, \"to break apart.\" When you disrupt, you break someone's concentration, break up a routine, or break apart a system or order, as when bad weather disrupts the travel plans of people in airports. Even if your headphones keep the music in your ears only, singing out loud can disrupt those around you. A larger interruption would be if a war were to erupt. That would disrupt the peace of an entire region and its people."
  },
  "recite": {
    "short": "You are showing off your ability to recite, or repeat aloud from memory, when you say the entire text of \"The Gettysburg Address\" or name all the past winners of your town’s asparagus eating contest.",
    "long": "Recite entered the English language as a legal term but is now more often used in the realms of education, literature, and religion. Children in school may be assigned a famous poem to recite in front of the class or be tested on how well they can recite their multiplication tables. In many religious traditions, being able to recite passages of sacred texts is an important part of practicing the religion."
  },
  "impudent": {
    "short": "An impudent person is bold, sassy, and shameless. If your teacher asks the class to open their textbooks, and you snap back, \"Let's not and say we did,\" you're being impudent.",
    "long": "Impudent comes from the Latin combination of im, meaning without, and pudens, meaning shame. We often call someone impudent if they’re disrespectful, snotty, or inappropriate in a way that makes someone feel bad. If you know someone has just lost all their money on the stock market, don’t be impudent and ask them how they’re going to afford gas money for their yacht."
  },
  "inept": {
    "short": "A clumsy, incompetent person — or an ineffective action — is inept. When you're inept, you don't know what you're doing or just can't get it done.",
    "long": "Someone inept is bumbling, clueless, and ineffective. Inept people are dumb or clueless; they don't understand things. More than that, inept people are bad at what they do. An inept lawyer always loses cases. An inept figure skater wipes out on the ice. An inept postal worker loses mail and puts it in the wrong box. An inept person is downright bad at something. The opposite of inept is competent."
  },
  "patriot": {
    "short": "A patriot is someone who loves and who has sometimes fought for his or her country. “Nathan Hale was a true patriot; his only regret was that he had but one life to give for his country.”",
    "long": "The word patriot comes from patrios (Greek, not Latin for once), which means \"of one’s father.\" So, despite various references to the motherland, the word patriot more or less lands us square in the fatherland arena. And if you’re a football fan, the New England Patriots is a near-Boston-based team (Boston being a major source of American patriots in the Revolutionary War). And, if you want to get yourself in trouble, you can wander Boston with a megaphone chanting, “The Patriots stink.”"
  },
  "adhere": {
    "short": "If you don't want monkey droppings to adhere to the sole of your shoe, watch where you’re walking. Maybe if you'd adhere, or stick to, the zoo rules and stay on the walking path, you wouldn't have to worry about it.",
    "long": "Adhere is from the 15th-century French verb meaning \"to stick.\" Things that are sticky will adhere, or attach, to surfaces and stay there, whether you want them to or not; in other words, they're adhesive, an adjective that comes from the same Latin source as the French verb. When a person chooses to adhere to something, it is more of a choice to stick with it or agree to abide by rules or guidelines. You can also adhere by being loyal, as when you adhere to the high moral standards or behavior expected of some organization."
  },
  "plenitude": {
    "short": "The noun plenitude means the state of being full or complete; also, an abundance. After the thirty inches of snow your town got over the weekend, you may joke that you have a plenitude of snow.",
    "long": "You can remember the meaning of plenitude if you remember that both plenitude and the word plenty come from the same Latin word plenus, meaning full or complete. Note that the spelling of plenitude has only one \"t,\" although people misspell the word as plentitude because they closely relate plenitude and plenty. You can even find the variant spelling in some dictionaries."
  },
  "intact": {
    "short": "If something is intact it's still in one piece. If you'd like your sand castle to remain intact, I suggest you build it away from the water.",
    "long": "The Latin word intactus means “untouched,” but today something is intact if it's whole, if it hasn't fallen apart. After a long day at work, you might feel lucky to be intact. Your letter to the post office states that you would prefer your packages to arrive intact from now on."
  },
  "aver": {
    "short": "To aver is to state something or declare something is true. This verb has a serious tone, so you might aver something on a witness stand or you might aver that you won't back down to a challenge.",
    "long": "The verb aver comes to English via the Latin root words ad, meaning \"to,\" and verus, meaning \"true.\" The word can have the sense of formally declaring something is true, but it can also mean to report positively: \"The grandmother averred that her granddaughter would make a fine veterinarian because of her love and caring for animals.\""
  },
  "oblation": {
    "short": "An oblation is a donation or offering to a religious institution. When you offer an oblation at church, you are symbolically presenting it to God.",
    "long": "While the financial donations made by members of a church, temple, or mosque can be thought of as oblations, the word is often used in the context of Catholicism and a few other Christian denominations to mean \"gift to God.\" During the Eucharist ritual in these churches, bread and wine are symbolically offered to God as an oblation. The Latin root of oblation is oblationem, \"an offering, presenting, or gift.\""

  "happen": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "adduce": {
    "short": "When you adduce something, you offer proof in support of an argument. If you’re trying to prove that you didn’t eat the last cookie, you might adduce the fact that your dog’s mouth is covered in cookie crumbs.",
    "long": "The word adduce comes from the Latin adducere, which means \"to lead or bring along.\" If you were a lawyer, you might adduce, or bring forth, a witness in order to help your case. You might also adduce a piece of evidence, like a fact, to help with your argument. You might think of the word add to help you remember the definition of adduce: when you adduce something, you are adding to an argument by offering proof."
  },
  "adaptive": {
    "short": "Use adaptive to describe people who are flexible — they don't lose their cool when plans change quickly and they are always willing to learn new ways to do things. Being adaptive helps you sail along in today's ever-changing world.",
    "long": "What do chameleons and your grandparents who only started using computers a few years ago have in common? They are adaptive. Just as chameleons change color to match their surroundings — green when sitting on leaves, brown when climbing the tree's trunk — your grandparents learned the skills to keep up with the world around them. The opposite of adaptive is stubborn. People, lizards, or anything that refuses to change are stubborn. To welcome change is to be adaptive."
  },
  "equal": {
    "short": "Things that are the same size or have the same traits are said to be equal. When it comes to people, being equal means everyone has the same rights and opportunities — and responsibilities.",
    "long": "When two or more things are level or balanced, they are said to be equal. This balance can refer to volume, weight, or quantity, or any other trait being compared. In a contest in which each side has the same chance of winning, the match is said to be equal. And when a person is considered at the same level with another in some respect, he or she is said to be that person's equal."
  },
  "synoptic": {
    "short": "If you’ve heard of a movie synopsis, which gives an overview of the plot, you can guess what synoptic means: summarizing. At the end of your 900-page treatise on morals, try to give a synoptic conclusion to drive your ideas home.",
    "long": "Synoptic can be broken down to syn-, meaning together, and -optic, meaning view or sight. So something that is synoptic pulls everything together. At the end of a long day touring your great aunt’s ancestral home, hearing endless stories about every dinner party she ever gave and all the people that ever stayed there, you might synoptically comment, “Basically she cooks well and has lots of fancy friends.”"
  },
  "prepare": {
    "short": "To prepare means to get ready for something. When you prepare for a test, you'll get a better score than if you don’t.",
    "long": "Look at all the variations that you find with prepare. If you prepare yourself mentally for an experience, you sent you mind on it happening. If you're going to tell your family that you're moving out, you might want to prepare them by having them sit down. Are you prepared for their reaction? Are you prepared to defend your decision? You can prepare wood to be painted by cleaning and sanding it. And if you prepare dinner, you cook it."
  },
  "complacent": {
    "short": "Someone who is complacent has become overly content — the junk-food-eating couch potato might be feeling complacent about his health.",
    "long": "The literal meaning of this word's Latin root is \"very pleased,\" but even though complacent people may seem pleased with themselves, we are rarely pleased with them. They are unconcerned by things that should concern them, and they may neglect their duties. A complacent person might be heard saying, \"Ehh, don't worry about it!\" — when there really is something to worry about."
  },
  "gripe": {
    "short": "The word gripe, as both noun and verb, refers to a minor complaint. Why gripe about the size of the portions when the food is so awful?",
    "long": "The key to gripe is that as complaints go, it's trivial. You don't gripe about your house burning down or the cost of medical care. You gripe about your friend's status updates and the fact the Yankees have too much money. A gripe can last a while. For example, the city has been hearing gripes about parking rules for a generation, but as complaints go, it's just not getting a lot of traction. One person's gripe, however, can be another person's major headache. It all depends on your point of view."
  },
  "extrapolate": {
    "short": "When you extrapolate, you use specific details to make a general conclusion. For example, if you travel to Canada and encounter only friendly, kind natives, you might extrapolate that all Canadians are friendly.",
    "long": "The verb extrapolate can mean \"to predict future outcomes based on known facts.\" For example, looking at your current grade report for math and how you are doing in class now, you could extrapolate that you'll likely earn a solid B for the year. Another meaning of extrapolate is \"estimate the value of.\" You could extrapolate how much your antique watch is worth by finding how much similar watches sold for at recent auctions."
  },
  "meticulous": {
    "short": "Someone who is meticulous pays extreme attention to detail. If that person is, say, your surgeon or your accountant, you'll definitely want them to be meticulous!",
    "long": "The Latin root of meticulous is metus, which means \"fear.\" Someone who's meticulous is afraid of what will happen if they're not careful enough to get every detail right. \"Detail-oriented\" and \"perfectionist\" are other ways of describing someone who cares deeply about the small things and about getting things exactly right, every time. Concert pianists must be meticulous, because audiences are always listening for wrong notes."
  },
  "extradite": {
    "short": "When a government extradites someone, it delivers that person to another country or state, usually to be tried for a crime. Treaties between countries often require them to extradite suspected criminals.",
    "long": "You might hear about a criminal attempting to hide in one country, only to have its government extradite him back to the place where he committed the crime. While individual countries sometimes resist the pressure to extradite suspects, treaties between countries often encourage them to do so. The verb extradite comes from its noun form, extradition, which was likely invented by Voltaire from a combination of the Latin ex, \"out,\" and traditionem, \"a delivering up or handing over.\""
  },
  "paroxysm": {
    "short": "A paroxysm is a convulsion or sudden fit, brought on because you're freaking out or coming down with something.",
    "long": "Paroxysm is from the Greek word paroxysmos, which basically means \"to irritate.\" If you're irritated to the point of having a wild fit, like if you see someone trying to steal your car, you might go into a paroxysm of rage. When the clowns performed their act, the audience went into a paroxysm of giggles. A paroxysm can be medical, too, like when an illness suddenly attacks, and you get symptoms like chills and a fever right away."
  },
  "tamp": {
    "short": "To tamp is to push or pack down a loose or granular material. If you work as a barista, you'll learn to tamp espresso grounds before running hot water through them.",
    "long": "Before a road is paved or a patio is laid out, workers will tamp gravel to provide a sturdy, level base. Old-fashioned, muzzle-loading guns had to be filled with gunpowder, which the user would need to tamp firmly before firing. The tool used to do the tamping is sometimes also called a tamp."
  },
  "observant": {
    "short": "If you're observant, you’re paying close attention to the details.  If you're really observant, you would notice the little blob of mustard on your boss's jacket and brush it off for him before he goes to his business dinner.",
    "long": "Your mother may be so observant that she notices every bit of dust you miss when you vacuum. But if you're so observant that you notice every coin on the sidewalk, you might soon have enough money saved to buy your mom a robo-vac. Observant can also mean that you're careful to follow laws and customs to the letter. If you’re an observant Jew or an observant Catholic, you’re following your religion’s rituals and practices very strictly."
  },
  "demoralize": {
    "short": "If something demoralizes you, it makes you feel bad or hopeless. When your soccer team was trounced by the last-place team in the league, the loss seemed to demoralize everyone, from players to coaches to fans.",
    "long": "Demoralize can also mean what it looks like, \"to remove the morals of.\" For example, parents worry that R-rated movies will demoralize their children. In other words, they fear kids will lose their sense of what's right and wrong if they see glamorous actors indulging in bad behavior."
  },
  "abhor": {
    "short": "If you abhor something, it gives you a feeling of complete hatred. Chances are you abhor that kid who used to torture the frogs in biology class.",
    "long": "Abhor is from Latin abhorrere — \"to shrink back in horror.\" It is the strongest way in English to express hatred, even stronger than loathe. We only use abhor in formal contexts; you might say \"I abhor that man,\" but you would be less likely to say \"I abhor spinach\" unless you tend to express yourself in highfalutin terms no matter what the occasion."
  },
  "endure": {
    "short": "If something endures, it lasts: Beethoven's fame has endured for more than 200 years. But if you endure something, you suffer through it: We endured our teacher's slide shows of her vacation photographs.",
    "long": "Notice above that something that endures can be good or bad. Something you endure is always bad. And people are forever talking about what they can't or won't endure, as in \"I refuse to endure any more abuse from my neighbors.\" Endure derives from the Latin indūrāre \"to make hard,\" formed from the prefix in- \"against, into\" plus dūrus \"hard.\""
  },
  "doleful": {
    "short": "To be doleful is to be down in the dumps, to have a hole in your soul, to be full of woe.",
    "long": "Doleful has nothing to do with a doe, a deer or a female deer. Unless one of those animals has a really sad look in its eyes. Expressions can be doleful, ditto a song or a set of circumstances. You can use the adjective doleful to describe something that is bringing you down, that makes you want to give into gravity or crawl into bed. Doleful is pretty much the opposite of how a ray of golden sun can make you feel."
  },
  "impersonate": {
    "short": "Impersonate means to pretend to be someone you're not. If you impersonate a bank teller in order to gain access to the money in the vault, you better hope nobody at the bank asks you any questions.",
    "long": "Impersonate comes from the Latin in and persona, meaning \"to invest with a personality.\" It often is used to describe someone posing as someone else for criminal purposes, but you can also impersonate someone for comedic effect. You may have seen actors on television do this. They impersonate politicians and celebrities by wearing wigs and makeup and try to match the famous person's mannerisms and way of speaking as closely as possible."
  },
  "paragon": {
    "short": "Paragon applies to someone who is a model of perfection in some quality or trait. We link paragon with other words that follow it, such as \"paragon of virtue\" or \"paragon of patience.\"",
    "long": "A paragon means someone or something that is the very best. The English noun paragon comes from the Italian word paragone, which is a touchstone, a black stone that is used to tell the quality of gold. You rub the gold on the touchstone and you can find out how good the gold is. You are hoping that it is the paragon of \"goldness.\""
  },
  "quotidian": {
    "short": "Quotidian is a fancy way of saying \"daily\" or \"ordinary.\" Quotidian events are the everyday details of life.",
    "long": "When you talk about the quotidian, you're talking about the little things in life: everyday events that are normal and not that exciting. Going to the store, doing chores, working or going to school, and brushing your teeth are all quotidian. If you take a spaceship to Mars, that would be unusual and extraordinary: the opposite of quotidian."
  },
  "premeditate": {
    "short": "When you premeditate, you are planning ahead. While most people associate this word with crime, let's hope you can think of a better reason to premeditate — like buying groceries before a storm.",
    "long": "When you meditate, you think deeply. The prefix pre- means “before,” so to premeditate means to think about a situation before you’ve jumped into it. If you’ve ever cooked a meal, you’ve premeditated the ingredients you need to get started. In a courtroom you’ll hear about \"premeditated murder,\" which means the accused killer planned out his crime and it wasn’t a crime of passion. Premeditating can be a good thing, but not when it involves murder."

  },
  "turbulent": {
    "short": "Turbulent means chaotic, disordered, characterized by conflict. A time of war is a turbulent time for a country. If your family moves and your parents get divorced, you might call that a turbulent period in your history.",
    "long": "This adjective also commonly describes unstable or violent movement in the atmosphere, or in oceans and rivers. When the pilot comes announces turbulent air or turbulence ahead, get ready for the plane to bump and shake. Turbulence has another specialized sense when describing an uneven flow of a liquid or gas."
  },
  "vogue": {
    "short": "If something is the latest vogue, it is the latest fashion. When your new hairstyle catches on, it's in vogue —  or if it becomes unpopular, it’s not.",
    "long": "Anything trendy or popular — an activity, fashionable clothing, a home decorating style, board games — can be called “in vogue.” If you notice everyone scrambling to collect, say, robotic hummingbirds, you'll know that they are the vogue item. You might think that tall boots are no longer in vogue, and you notice a lot of short skirts showing up in Vogue magazine. Vogue — the magazine — often decides what fashion is in vogue."
  },
  "surreal": {
    "short": "If you see a goldfish fly out of a melting clock and offer you tango lessons, you’re having a surreal experience! Either that or you’re asleep and dreaming. Things that are surreal combine unrelated elements to create a bizarre scene.",
    "long": "The adjective surreal comes from Surrealism, a movement that produced films, writing, painting, and other art forms that often contained irrational, disjointed images. So, surreal describes something that’s a bizarre mix of elements, often jarring and seemingly nonsensical. Images can be surreal, like the melting clocks in Salvador Dali's paintings, but so can strange, dream-like moments in everyday life."
  },
  "bilk": {
    "short": "Ever paid a restaurant bill only to discover they charged you for stuff you never had? What they did was bilk you — cheat you out of money that was justly yours. Shady companies are forever bilking their investors.",
    "long": "To bilk someone is slightly different from plain robbing them, though the effect is the same; it implies a non-violent, subtle and devious method masquerading as legitimate. Bernie Madoff, the Ponzi scheme king, was a classic bilker. On a more enjoyable note, one of the greatest bilkers in TV history was the appropriately named Sergeant Bilko, played by the comedian Phil Silvers. His eternal card games, promotions and get-rich-quick schemes were all designed to part some poor sucker from their cash. Watch and learn from the master."

  "exasperation": {
    "short": "If you've ever become so frustrated with someone or something that you feel like you're at the end of your rope, you have experienced exasperation. You are fed up!",
    "long": "Exasperation goes back to the Latin verb exasperare, meaning “to make rough.” When you are in a state of exasperation, you feel like something annoying you've had to put up with has put you in a rough mood. If you take up golf, you might find it to be a source of relaxation or a source of exasperation. Watching you try to teach your dog to fetch, I'm not sure which is more amusing: his stubbornness or your exasperation."
  },
  "incantation": {
    "short": "\"Double, double toil and trouble / Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.\" These lines, cackled by the Weird Sisters in Shakespeare's Macbeth, are part of the most famous incantation — or magic spell made of words — in English literature.",
    "long": "Incantation shares a Latin source with enchant, both of which are related to chant. An incantation, then, summons a thing or action into being with words that are sung, spoken, or written. Long before it became the catchword of stage magicians, abracadabra was regarded as a powerful incantation capable of warding off serious disease. The phrase hocus pocus may be a corruption of a 17th-century incantation spoken during the Roman Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist, \"hoc est corpus meum\" (\"this is my body\")."

  "conceivable": {
    "short": "If you see yellowish skies on a humid, spring evening in Kansas, it is entirely conceivable that a tornado is in the making. That is to say, it's imaginable or even possible, so make sure you take every conceivable precaution.",
    "long": "If you conceive of something, you imagine or think of it. So, it makes sense that the adjective conceivable describes things that can be imagined or thought of. People often use the word conceivable in extreme contexts. If you look everywhere for your homework but still can't find it, you might declare, \"I searched in every conceivable location! My homework must have disappeared.\" In response, your teacher might remark that disappearing homework is inconceivable, or \"impossible to imagine.\""
  },
  "evoke": {
    "short": "The verb evoke most commonly means to bring a feeling, memory, or picture into the mind. When you visit your old elementary school, the smells, sounds, and colors there can evoke memories from the past.",
    "long": "Similarly, a certain reaction can be evoked by words or actions, as in \"His comments evoked anger in the community.\" A near synonym is elicit, as in \"No matter how many different ways the detective questioned the suspect, he could not elicit any response. Evoke was borrowed from Latin evocare, from the prefix e- \"out,\" plus vocare \"to call.\""
  },
  "poseur": {
    "short": "\"Strike a pose,\" sang Madonna in her most famous song, \"Vogue.\" But if the pose you're striking is fake, pretentious, or arrogant, you're a poseur. Be yourself: it's cooler.",
    "long": "It's one thing to be smart, funny, or cool. It's another thing to pretend to be that way: that's the life of a poseur. (Say it in the French way: poh-ZUHR.) It's all too easy to spot a poseur from their ridiculous posing. Why poseurs think that they come across as anything other than fake is beyond me. They must be really insecure to think they need to pretend to be something they're not. Every once in a while, though, a poseur can fake it till they make it. Then they're no longer a poseur."
  },
  "narcotic": {
    "short": "Use the noun narcotic to talk about a pain relieving or sleep inducing drug and the adjective narcotic to describe anything that has these same effects.",
    "long": "Patients who have their wisdom teeth removed are often given a narcotic to ease their pain afterward. A numbing drug is usually just what they need to recover — that and plenty of ice cream. If a hot bath and a cup of tea make you incredibly drowsy, you can say that they have a narcotic effect on you. In the United States, narcotic drugs are illegal without a doctor's prescription — narcotic often has a negative connotation, especially when it's used in news reports."
  },
  "apathetic": {
    "short": "Apathetic is an adjective that describes the feeling of being bored with what’s going on around you.  If you don’t care one way or another, you’re apathetic.",
    "long": "The Greek word pathos describes a type of emotional suffering that afflicts people who are super sensitive to their environment.  Pathos is a root word of apathetic, but the prefix a- turns it into the opposite: emotional boredom, insensitivity, and a lack of enthusiasm.  Maybe you feel apathetic because nothing around you stirs your interest, or maybe it’s because you need some coffee."

  "decrepitude": {
    "short": "Many old buildings located in “ghost towns” in the Old West area of the United States are in a state of decrepitude. In other words, they are worn out and in disrepair.",
    "long": "Decrepitude is usually a result of old age or neglect. Elderly people can be in this state and so can things, such as homes and automobiles. Similar words, which also happen to start with the letter D, are dilapidation and deterioration. Haunted houses featured in the movies are good examples of decrepitude. Most of them are not new and shiny, but have peeling paint, creaking floorboards, and lots of cobwebs."
  },
  "allege": {
    "short": "If you accuse someone of committing a crime but the proof of the wrongdoing isn't yet found, use the verb allege. You might allege that your sister broke a vase, just because no one else was home when you heard the crash.",
    "long": "If you ever watch news programs, you often hear the verb allege. A reporter might say that detectives allege that a certain person, who is now being held without bail, set a fire. This can be confusing: If the person is in jail, then he or she must have set that fire, right? In reality, the person is a suspect, awaiting trial. In our country, people are assumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. That's why we used allege until we know for sure."
  },
  "ingrained": {
    "short": "Use the adjective ingrained to describe the strong beliefs of someone who has thought that way for a very long time, such as the ingrained patriotism of a 20-year military veteran.",
    "long": "Ingrained comes from the word grain, which in late Middle English referred to a certain kind of dye. This type of dye was indelible — unable to be removed — much like ingrained beliefs that are so firmly fixed that they'll never change."
  },
  "morosely": {
    "short": "When you do something morosely, you do it in a sullen, moody way. When you sit on the couch, sighing and looking sad because you didn't get invited to your friend's party, you are sitting there morosely.",
    "long": "Morose means gloomy or in a bad mood, so whenever the adverb morosely describes your actions, you're not feeling very cheerful. There is an element of crankiness in the word morosely, which you can even see it its Latin root, morosus, which means \"peevish\". So when you do something morosely, you're not just sad, but you're making sure everyone knows how you're feeling."
  },
  "nocturnal": {
    "short": "If something is nocturnal, it belongs to or is active at night. That includes vampires, owls that like to hunt by moonlight, and that roommate who stays up playing video games until the wee hours of the morning.",
    "long": "The adjective nocturnal comes from the Late Latin nocturnalis, which means “belonging to the night.\" You've probably heard of nocturnal animals, like bats and fireflies, who sleep during the day and come out to play when the sun goes down. The opposite of nocturnal is diurnal, meaning active during the daytime — but you probably won't be using that word much unless you're a zoologist."
  },
  "jovial": {
    "short": "Use jovial to describe people who show good humor and are full of joy. Santa Claus, with his constant \"ho-ho-hoing\" is a jovial figure.",
    "long": "Jocose and jocular are similar words, but they refer more to things that actually cause laughter. Jovial is derived from the Late Latin Iovialis, \"relating to Jupiter\" — the ancient Roman god of the sky.  In astrology, people born under the sign of Jupiter are said to be joyful."
  },
  "dispel": {
    "short": "To dispel is to get rid of something that's bothering or threatening you, regardless of whether that's warts, worries, or wild dogs.",
    "long": "The nifty thing about dispel is that you can use it when talking about emotional problems (such as worries and fears) as well as physical ones (such as wild dogs). Note, however, that when dispel is used in reference to physical foes, it often has the added meaning of scattering your opponents in all directions. So, while you can dispel a pack of wild dogs, you should just chase off or drive away a lone wolf. Good luck with that, by the way."
  },
  "wan": {
    "short": "Someone who is wan is visibly unwell and lacking in energy. If you’ve had the flu for over a week, and you finally get out of bed looking pale and tired, your mother might say that you look wan.",
    "long": "When your aunt comes to dinner and eats three helpings of dessert, she might seem a little wan as she drinks her tea, meaning she looks sickly and weak — and no wonder, after so many slices of pie! Wan can also describe a fading light — one that is sickly and weak, just like your aunt. When the light bulb in the living room burns out and leaves only wan twilight filtering in, you’ll find it impossible to read."
  },
  "blemish": {
    "short": "A blemish is a small flaw. If you borrow your brother's brand new bicycle, you'd better be careful — what might seem like the tiniest blemish to you might be a horribly ruined paint job to him.",
    "long": "The classic example of a blemish is a pimple or other mark on your skin, but you can call any small defect a blemish — like a worm hole in an apple or a scrape on the side of your car. A flaw or fault in your personality or morals can also be called a blemish. You might say that the one time your dog accidentally nipped you is the only blemish on his reputation as a sweet, gentle pet."

  "denigrate": {
    "short": "To denigrate is to say bad things — true or false — about a person or thing. Your reputation as a math whiz might be hurt if your jealous classmate manages to denigrate you, even though the accusations are unfounded.",
    "long": "The verb denigrate comes from the Latin word denigrare, which means “to blacken.” To sully or defame someone’s reputation, or to spread negative or hurtful information about a company or a situation, is to denigrate it. Your neighbors may denigrate your proposal for mandatory recycling in an attempt to stop your plan. Denigrate can also mean that you're making something seem less important, like when your brother tries to denigrate your athletic achievements."
  },
  "staggering": {
    "short": "A staggering amount is an astonishing, astounding, stupefying amount. Anything staggering blows your mind.",
    "long": "If you know that stagger means to stumble around uncertainly, then you're close to the meaning of staggering: this is a word for things that are so hard to believe you might fall down when you hear them. If the President gets shot, that's staggering news. If there's a major earthquake, that's staggering. Alien life contacting the Earth would be extremely staggering. Anything that knocks your socks off or makes your mind reel is staggering."
  },
  "collude": {
    "short": "When you collude with someone you secretly plot together to do something bad. You might collude with your twin sister to find out where all the birthday presents are hidden.",
    "long": "The word collude entered English in the 16th century from the Latin word colludere, meaning “have a secret agreement,” a combination of col-, meaning “together,” and ludere, meaning “to play.” When you collude with someone, it's like you’re playing together on the same team for the purpose of getting something you want, typically something illegal or harmful. Companies may collude to keep prices high, or politicians may collude to keep damaging information secret."
  },
  "irreconcilable": {
    "short": "Your dad wants Mozart in the car and you want Eminem? That's an irreconcilable difference right there — two tastes or ideas or preferences so different from each other there can be no compatibility or middle ground. Diplomacy can't help, only headphones.",
    "long": "Where would divorce lawyers be without this lovely word irreconcilable? Their clients don't just have differences with their spouses, they have \"irreconcilable differences\" — in other words, demands or points of view so distant from each other they can never be bought together. Bye-bye marriage, hello legal fees."
  },
  "ennui": {
    "short": "The French word ennui describes a feeling that combines tiredness and boredom. Ennui is one version of \"the blahs.\"",
    "long": "Though it sounds it little fancy — maybe because it comes from French — ennui is a common feeling that everybody experiences: being bored and tired. School and work fill lots of people with ennui. A terrible TV show could create ennui. If you feel like your life is going nowhere, ennui could set in. When you're feeling ennui, you might as well take a nap, because you're too drowsy and uninterested to do much of anything else."
  },
  "compliant": {
    "short": "If you are willing to submit to someone's request, then you are compliant. Parents like it when their teenagers are compliant and follow the rules. Teenagers, on the other hand, are probably not as compliant as parents would like to think!",
    "long": "The adjective compliant can also describe something that conforms or is agreeable. \"The lawyers made sure that the man's will was fully compliant with state law, so that his children could not contest his desire to leave his entire estate to his dog, Fluffy.\" If you buy computer software that is not compliant with your operating system, it won't work properly."
  },
  "equanimity": {
    "short": "If you take the news of your parakeet's death with equanimity, it means you take it calmly without breaking down. Equanimity refers to emotional calmness and balance in times of stress.",
    "long": "If equanimity reminds you of equal, that's because the words have a lot in common. The noun equanimity was borrowed from Latin aequanimitās, from aequanimus, \"even-tempered, fair,\" formed from aequus, \"even, level, equal,\" plus animus, \"mind.\" The archaic phrase to bear with equal mind means \"to bear with a calm mind,\" and is a translation from the Latin. The phrase a level mind also refers to calmness. A near synonym is composure."
  },
  "rejoicing": {
    "short": "Rejoicing is celebration or festivity. There will be great rejoicing when your favorite cousin comes home after his three years away in the Peace Corps.",
    "long": "You can use the word rejoicing as a noun, to mean jubilation and joy, or as an adjective to mean \"joyful.\" A rejoicing crowd is full of happiness and cheer, and a rejoicing child might jump up and down with excitement. Rejoicing comes from the verb rejoice, which is rooted in the Old French word rejoir, a combination of the intensive re and joir, \"be glad.\""
  },
  "impair": {
    "short": "If you make bad decisions in the morning after drinking coffee, you might conclude that caffeine tends to impair your judgment. When you impair something, you damage it or make it work poorly.",
    "long": "The root of the verb impair traces back to the Latin word pejorare, meaning “to make worse,” and that’s still what happens if you impair something. Whether it’s communication, visibility, or your marriage prospects, if you impair it, you make it worse. The word can be used for situations that describe something that has deteriorated, such as “Snow continued to impair driving conditions.”"
  },
  "sway": {
    "short": "Back and forth...back and forth...back and forth...are you sea-sick yet? The sway, or rocking motion, of a boat is too much for many stomachs.",
    "long": "People can sway if they're dizzy, tilting from side to side as they walk. On a windy day you can see trees swaying and bending in the wind. Swaying is usually a gentle motion, but if you're easily swayed, you're in trouble. That means you're easily influenced by others. People of power often \"hold sway\" over their followers, controlling them with the seeming ease of the breeze."
  },
  "reckoning": {
    "short": "A reckoning is a calculation or number you estimate. You might say, \"By my reckoning, there are now seventeen kids in the bouncy house, which might be a few too many.\"",
    "long": "The act of counting or tallying can be called a reckoning, and so can a person's opinion on something. You could describe an ancient astronomer's reckoning that the Earth was at the center of the universe or your own reckoning that guests should never stay more than three days. And if you and your estranged sister have a reckoning, it means you finally get together and hold each other accountable for past actions."
  },
  "garner": {
    "short": "To garner means to gather or earn. If you want to run for office without belonging to a political party, you must garner enough signatures — usually a few thousand — to get onto the ballot.",
    "long": "The word garner comes from the Latin granarium which means \"store-house,\" usually for grain. The current use of the word carries with it the sense of something being stored up. It’s not only that you can gather enough yes-votes to overcome the opposition, there is the sense that all the things you have garnered have some weight of their own. In its other use, garner means “earn” or \"merit.\" Think of movie stars garnering Oscar nominations for their excellent work."

    "short": "A flag is a piece of cloth that represents a country, group, or institution. If you're particularly proud of your Irish heritage, you might fly an Irish flag in your front yard.",
    "long": "A real flag enthusiast might fly the American flag, their state flag, their city's flag, and the flag of their parents' birth countries. There are also flags used for signaling on ships at sea and during races and sporting events, and flags that represent armies or advertise products. When flag is used as a verb, it means \"to lose energy or enthusiasm.\" When students start to flag in the afternoon, they tend to take a quick nap — sitting up at their desks."
  },
  "affiliated": {
    "short": "If two things are affiliated, they are closely associated or connected with one another. When you join a cause, you become affiliated with it and what it represents.  You learned to choose your battles more carefully after becoming affiliated with the \"Save the Pigeons\" campaign.",
    "long": "Coming from the verb \"affiliate,\" the adjective affiliated shares its history, starting with the Latin stem affiliare, meaning \"to adopt.\" As such, we \"adopt\" the ideals and goals of groups with which we join and become affiliated. You could be affiliated with a particular church or temple.  As a celebrity, you are affiliated with a number of charities. There is also a legal meaning, whereby a mother can affiliate a child, or declare its paternity."

    "long": "Samuel A. Maverick owned a lot of cattle, and he let them roam around Texas without a brand, or identification mark, seared into their skins. Samuel was a maverick for going against the common practice of tracking his animals, and his last name became part of the English language as both an adjective and a noun in the 19th century. Someone who acts very independently is a maverick, and individual actions that stand out are maverick, as in \"her maverick jumping style on the ice was both wild and delicate.\""
  },
  "specious": {
    "short": "Use specious to describe an argument that seems to be good, correct, or logical, but is not so. We live on the earth, therefore the earth must be the center of the universe has been proven to be a specious theory of the solar system.",
    "long": "Specious is pronounced \"SPEE-shuhs.\" Something that is specious is attractive in a deceptive way, and if you follow the word's etymology, you'll see why. In Middle English, this adjective meant \"attractive,\" from Latin speciōsus \"showy, beautiful,\" from speciēs \"appearance, kind, sort.\" Latin speciēs is also the source of English species."

  "syntax": {
    "short": "One of the hardest things about learning a new language is figuring out the syntax, or the basic rules for the way that words and phrases should be arranged in a sentence in order for it to make sense.",
    "long": "Syntax isn't necessarily something you think about when you're speaking, but the order of words in a sentence can make a huge difference to its meaning. If you aren't convinced, try telling a waiter that you'd like \"a slice of dessert for cake.\" And then, as the waiter stands there looking confused, try explaining that you don't think \"important is very syntax.\""

  "ornithology": {
    "short": "Ornithology is the scientific study of birds.",
    "long": "Zoology is the broad field that studies animals, but there are as many subfields as there are critters. One is ornithology: the study of birds. This includes tiny birds like finches and huge birds like vultures. Ornithologists study bird songs, feathers, migration patterns, and everything else about birds. People who are experts in ornithology — ornithologists — go to graduate school, but you don't have to study birds in school to be interested. Birdwatchers know a lot of ornithology too."

    "long": "Legerdemain can be used literally to describe a magic trick, or figuratively to describe some other kind of trickery or deceit. If you and some friends cook up a scheme that involves telling complicated lies so that you can stay out all night, you are guilty of legerdemain. The word comes from the French léger de main which means dexterous, or light of hand."

  "onomatopoeia": {
    "short": "Boom! Bang! Crash! When a word is formed from the sound that an associated thing makes, call it an example of onomatopoeia.",
    "long": "In Greek, onomatopoeia (on-uh-mah-tuh-PEE-ah) simply means \"word-making,\" but in English it refers to a very specific process of word-making: an attempt to capture the sound of something. Examples of onomatopoeia in English include burble, buzz, slosh, ratatat, and thud. Words created by onomatopoeia can seem totally natural, but they can be surprisingly different from language to language: in Japanese, dogs say wan wan, but in Greek they say gav gav."
  },
  "dilatory": {
    "short": "Something dilatory creates a delay. Remember when your math teacher asked you to work out a problem on the board and you tried to get her talking about her favorite theorems instead? That was a dilatory tactic.",
    "long": "The adjective dilatory comes from the Latin root word dilator, a noun that means \"someone who puts off things\" or \"a procrastinator.\" If you are always late to appointments, people may accuse you of being dilatory, especially if they think you don't have a good excuse."
  },
  "pathological": {
    "short": "If something is caused by a physical or mental disease, it is pathological. Someone with a pathological compulsion for cleanliness might scrub the floors for hours every night.",
    "long": "Pathological comes from a Greek word, pathologikos, which means “treating of diseases” — pathos means \"suffering.\" Anyone who studies or works with diseases, from their causes to their symptoms, identifies how the disease affects its victims, in other words, its pathological effects. Remember that this is a medical distinction. If a person has, for example, obsessive-compulsive disorder, his or her repetitive actions are pathological."
  },
  "overture": {
    "short": "An overture is a piece of music played by an orchestra at the beginning of an opera or play. When an overture begins, the actors take their places and wait for the curtain to rise.",
    "long": "The noun overture can also mean \"a suggestion or approach designed to get a reaction.\" Your romantic overture of singing to your girlfriend in the restaurant was met with an embarrassed stare. An overture can also be an event that comes first, like your story about how the after-school program has helped hundreds of kids, an overture to the plea for donations you made next."
  },
  "limerick": {
    "short": "A limerick is a humorous form of poetry that rhymes and has five lines. Many limericks are dirty.",
    "long": "When you study literature, you'll probably read some sonnets, sestinas, haiku, and plays written in verse: there might not be much attention given to limericks. That's because limericks are a more popular, non-literary form of poetry: they're mainly humorous and often sexual. A limerick has five lines and follows the rhyme scheme aabba, using what is called anapestic meter (which has to do with syllables). Many limericks involve a man from Nantucket, usually doing something unprintable with a bucket."
  },
  "liberal": {
    "short": "A liberal is someone on the left wing of politics — the opposite of a conservative. Also, a liberal attitude toward anything means more tolerance for change.",
    "long": "There are many meanings for liberal, but they mostly have to do with freedom and openness to change. A teacher with a liberal policy toward attendance is going to be forgiving of missed days. A bank with a liberal attitude toward your money would probably be bad: some things are awful if they're loose and free. But no one will give you a hard time if you use a liberal amount of catsup on your fries."
  },
  "compunction": {
    "short": "When you feel compunction you feel very, very sorry, usually for something you did to hurt someone or mess something up. When you feel no compunction, you're not at all sorry.",

    "long": "A mandatory action is something that is required, obligatory, or compulsory. Like letting your Great Aunt Edna pinch your cheeks or passing gym to get your diploma. Mandatory is often used in opposition to optional. If you want to compete with the swim team at school, weeknight practices are mandatory, meaning you have to go, though the Saturday dawn swim practice remains optional, meaning it's up to you."

    "short": "Indeterminate means not known or decided. When someone contracts a rare stomach parasite but has not been traveling internationally, you might say it had indeterminate origins.",
    "long": "It's important to distinguish indeterminate from undetermined, which means not yet decided.

  },
  "foible": {

    "long": "Sometimes a foible helps make a person who they are, even if the foible, or weakness (\"feeble\" is a close relative), is a little odd. Synonyms for foible in a negative sense are \"failing,\" \"shortcoming,\" and in a more positive sense \"quirk,\" \"eccentricity.\" It can likewise be annoying or endearing.

  },
  "approximate": {
    "short": "To approximate is to calculate the value of something based on informed knowledge. A computer program can approximate the value of a house based on square footage, number of rooms, year built, and other relevant factors.",
    "long": "As a verb, approximate means \"to estimate.\" Unlike the word guess, approximate implies the use of a logical or mathematical method. You might guess how tall a friend is based on the first number that comes to mind, but you could approximate his height by using your own height as a comparison. As an adjective, approximate can mean \"near\" or \"close together.\" If your friend calls to say he’s at a location approximate to your house, she’s in your neighborhood."
  },
  "succinct": {
    "short": "Something that is succinct is short and clear. If you're going to be interviewed on television about your new book and only have a five minute slot, you'll need to come up with a succinct version of your story.",
    "long": "Succinct, meaning \"short and to the point,\" is from the Latin succingere, \"to tuck up.\" Often after you write a long essay, you realize you probably could have said the same thing in one or two succinct pages. If something is too succinct, we might call it terse. Another synonym is concise, which implies that unnecessary material has been removed. It's the opposite of wordy."
  },
  "eulogy": {
    "short": "At every funeral, there comes a moment when someone speaks about the life of the person who died. The speaker is delivering what is known as a eulogy. A eulogy is a formal speech that praises a person who has died.",
    "long": "Usually a eulogy makes the dead person sound a lot more impressive than they really were. A couple of less common synonyms for this kind of \"praise the dead\" speech are panegyric and encomium. Sometimes the dead person was so unimpressive that there's nothing nice to say. And sometimes they were so awful that the only appropriate speech is a dyslogy that describes their faults and failings."
  },
  "steadfast": {
    "short": "Someone who is firm and determined in a belief or a position can be called steadfast in that view, like your mom when she thinks you really shouldn’t wear that outfit.",
    "long": "The word steadfast traces back to the Old English word stedefæst, a combination of stede, meaning \"place,\" and fæst, meaning \"firmly fixed.\" Picture a steadfast person standing firmly in place, not wavering or budging an inch, and you’ll have a good sense of what this word means. Someone can be steadfast in a belief, an effort, a plan, or even a refusal. Whatever it is, it means that the person will calmly hold firm to the chosen position and follow through with determination."

  },
  "ornery": {
    "short": "To be ornery is to be grumpy and hard to please. Oscar the Grouch? Definitely ornery.",
    "long": "The adjective ornery sprung up in the early 19th century when people started pronouncing ordinary with an accent.  The root of ordinary is the Latin word for “order,” and if you disrupt the orderly existence of an ornery person, prepare to get yelled at.  A person can have a consistently ornery personality, or maybe you’re feeling ornery today because you skipped breakfast.  Some synonyms for ornery are cantankerous and crotchety, words that sound as grumpy as the people they describe."
  },
  "peculate": {
    "short": "If you embezzle, especially if you steal public funds for your own private use, then you peculate that money. To peculate is, of course, illegal — if you're caught, you can serve jail time.",
    "long": "Peculate comes from the Latin word peculium, meaning private property, which itself has the root pecu, or cattle, so the literal meaning of peculium is \"property in cattle.\" Cattle were considered very valuable property in ancient times, and stealing them was a grave act. Other words that have pecu at their roots include \"peculiar\" and \"pecuniary.\" Despite the extremely similar spelling, the word \"speculate\" has totally different roots that have nothing to do with either cattle or embezzlement."

    "long": "Untoward also describes things that are not good for you, such as untoward advice from someone your parents always said was a bad influence. Think about what you do when you move toward something: you get closer to it. Suppose you're moving toward a goal. You are, as they say, \"on the right path.\" But when you add the prefix un- you reverse that, and you're no longer on the path to that goal — you're untoward."

  "affiliation": {
    "short": "An affiliation is an official connection to something. To have an affiliation to something is to be affiliated with it. The Tea Party pretty clearly has an affiliation with the Republican Party.",
    "long": "You can be connected to all sorts of things, but to have an affiliation is to have an official connection. A local church might have an affiliation with a larger religious organization. A bunch of small groups might share an affiliation with a larger one, as in the case of baseball teams and the leagues they belong to. Often you'll hear politicians denying any affiliation with certain groups, places, or companies, because they want to appear neutral. If you have an affiliation with something, you're likely to pay it extra attention."
  },
  "hortatory": {
    "short": "Hortatory is a word used to describe a behavior or action that is encouraging. In the face of great economic crisis, the president's speech takes on a hortatory or encouraging tone, at a time when people most need the reassurance.",
    "long": "Hortatory, pronounced hawr-tuh-tawr-ee, is probably not a word you hear a lot, but what it describes is common. Teachers often give hortatory speeches when students are most overwhelmed. Coaches scream hortatory remarks to their team in the locker room to keep the players motivated. When you're lying in bed in the morning ignoring your alarm, look for that little hortatory voice in your head, encouraging you to get up so that you're not late."
  },
  "cogent": {
    "short": "When you make a cogent argument, it means your argument is clear and persuasive. In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations of complex government policy, it’s hard to find a cogent argument amidst all the emotional outbursts.",
    "long": "Cogent comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool…well that’s not a cogent argument; it’s just random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with nature."
  },
  "precarious": {
    "short": "Grab for the adjective precarious when something is unstable, dangerous or difficult and likely to get worse. Are you totally broke and the people you owe money to keep calling? You're in a precarious financial situation!",
    "long": "The Latin root of precarious means \"obtained by asking or praying.\" This fits well as precarious always signals that help is needed desperately. If your life is precarious or you are in a precarious situation, things could become difficult, maybe even dangerous, for you. If your footing or hold on something is precarious, it is unstable or not firmly placed, so that you are likely to slip or lose your grip."

    "short": "The verb refute is to prove that something is wrong. When the kids you're babysitting swear they brushed their teeth, you can refute their claim by presenting the dry toothbrushes.",
    "long": "Evidence and arguments are used to refute something. So are facts. For example, if children who eat chocolate before going to bed go straight to sleep, that refutes the idea that sugar keeps them up. Refute comes from the Latin refutare for \"to check, suppress.\" A near synonym is confute, but save refute as an everyday word for proving something is false."
  },
  "divination": {
    "short": "The idea that you can see the future by supernatural means is called divination. When your friend tells your fortune by reading the tea leaves in your cup, she claims to have the power of divination.",
    "long": "The prediction or prophecy itself that's given through the act of fortune telling is also called divination. A psychic's divination that your aunt will soon start a family is much less impressive if your aunt is obviously pregnant. You can also use divination to refer to someone's unusual intuition, like a child who seems to know by divination when someone is feeling sad or upset."
  },
  "buoyant": {
    "short": "Something that is buoyant floats in water. Since floating is happier than sinking, buoyant also refers to things are fun and upbeat.",
    "long": "Someone with a buoyant personality is fun to be around, laughs a lot, smiles, and cheers other people up. Buoyant people are lively and lighthearted — the opposite of sad, depressed, and bummed out. Buoyant people are also called bubbly and cheerful, and it should help to remember that buoyant objects float — just like a buoyant person can seem like they're floating too (as in the expression \"floating on air\")."
  },
  "infatuated": {
    "short": "Think he has no faults? Blush when he walks by? You are infatuated. When you are infatuated, your crush is so severe that it's pretty darned foolish.",
    "long": "Infatuation comes from the Latin infature which means \"to make a fool of.\" You can be infatuated with a person, but you can also be infatuated with an idea: \"Nick was so infatuated with the idea of knighthood that he wore a suit of armor to the prom, and asked to be called 'Sir Nicholas the Brave.'\""
  },
  "fledgling": {
    "short": "A fledgling is a fuzzy baby bird just learning to fly, or someone (like a baby bird) who's brand new at doing something. Awww.",
    "long": "If you're not talking about a baby bird, fledgling is often used as an adjective describing a new participant in something, like a fledgling senator still learning the ropes of how to legislate, or a fledgling drama program trying to build audiences for its plays. It can also mean inexperienced and young, like the fledgling photographer for the school paper who accidentally erases all the pictures. If you're British, spell it fledgeling if you like, both spellings are correct."
  },
  "facilitate": {
    "short": "To facilitate means to make something easier. If your best friend is very shy, you could facilitate her efforts to meet new people.",
    "long": "Facilitate comes from the Latin facilis, for \"easy.\" It means to make something easier or more likely to happen. You facilitate growth or a process, as opposed to, say, dinner.  Often in business meetings someone will be assigned to facilitate a discussion so people don't just sit in awkward silence. Synonyms are ease, simplify, expedite, and assist."
  },
  "espy": {
    "short": "To espy something is to see it, or glimpse it. If you look through binoculars long enough, you might espy a colorful bird.",
    "long": "Though you can use the verb espy whenever you want to say \"see,\" \"spot,\" or \"notice,\" it's primarily a literary word that you'll mostly find in books. One character might espy another strolling in a garden, or a pipe-smoking detective might espy a clue behind a parlor door. Espy comes from the Old French espiier, \"observe, watch or spy on,\" from a Germanic root."
  },
  "toady": {
    "short": "You can call the kid who is always really nice to the teacher in hopes of getting a good grade a brown-noser or, if you want to sound clever, a toady.",
    "long": "The word toady has a gross, yet engaging history. Back when medicine was more trickery than science, traveling medicine men would come to a town. Their assistant would eat a toad (you read that right) that was assumed poisonous so that the medicine man could \"heal\" him. Who would want that job, right? So toad-eater, later shortened to toady, came to mean a person who would do anything to please his boss."
  },
  "orison": {
    "short": "An orison is a prayer or plea to a deity. You might make an orison if you wanted your sick mom to get better.",
    "long": "Some words are considered archaic — meaning they are not in common modern use. Such a word is orison, which means a prayer. Today, you'd be surprised to see the word outside of a poem or some liturgical reference. This comes from a Latin word meaning to speak, and it means to speak to God. It's a poetic word Shakespeare used in Romeo and Juliet, when Juliet says, \"I have need of many orisons\" as she prepares to deceive her parents."
  },
  "inveterate": {
    "short": "If you're an inveterate doodler, all your notebooks are covered with drawings. If you're an inveterate golf player, you probably get twitchy if you haven't been out on a course in a week.",
    "long": "Inveterate comes from the Latin root for “old,” and it describes old habits. In Middle English the word was associated with chronic disease. Now it simply refers to something that is a signature habit with a person. If you’ve loved books ever since you were a toddler, and you regularly check out big stacks from the library, you’re an inveterate reader. And if you're an inveterate nail-biter, nothing can cure you of the habit."
  },
  "imbue": {
    "short": "To imbue is to fill up with or become \"soaked\" in an idea or emotion, as a sponge takes in water. One visit to a sick relative in a hospital might be enough to imbue a child with a lifelong ambition to become a doctor.",
    "long": "You can use imbue in a similar way as \"saturate,\" or \"soak through,\" to describe a filling or absorbing. A \"hue\" is a color, and it rhymes with imbue. When you're imbued with something, you are, in a way, colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from a spaghetti bowl, the color and the oil soak in. To fill people with qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with strength or optimism."
  },
  "apotheosis": {
    "short": "If your teacher says the term paper you handed in last week is a work of genius that sets a new gold standard for the school, he's telling you your work is the apotheosis of term papers. The epitome. Perfection.",
    "long": "Hidden in the middle of apotheosis you'll find the Greek theos, meaning god. (Theology, the study of religion, has the same root.) Combine theos with apo \"from\" and you get a person, place, or thing that is so out-of-this-world amazing that it seems as if it's \"from God.\" It's divine. You could make the assertion that Leonardo da Vinci was the apotheosis of genius and that the Mona Lisa is the apotheosis of all his paintings."

  "rigor": {
    "short": "When a school boasts of its academic rigor, it means its students learn a lot and work really hard. Rigor means thoroughness and exhaustiveness — the gold standard for a good teacher.",
    "long": "You may have heard of \"rigor mortis\" — which is a medical term describing the stiffness of a body after death. Another meaning of rigor is \"sternness or severity\" — for many, the rigors of boot camp are not easy to endure."
  },
  "dissonance": {
    "short": "Disagreeable sounds can be called dissonance. You know it's dissonance if you have the strong desire to cover your ears with your hands.",
    "long": "Racket, noise, dissonance — all can describe sounds that are not pleasant. While some musicians purposely add a little dissonance into their melodies to create an unexpected sound, others, like someone who just started drum lessons, creates dissonance by accident. Dissonance can also be a conflict between people or opinions, like the dissonance you feel when you want to do something but your parents say \"no.\""
  },
  "nausea": {
    "short": "When you feel like you might throw up, that's nausea. I know you're feeling sea sick, but if our boat sinks, nausea will be the least of your problems.",
    "long": "Nausea gets its root from the Greek word for ship, naus, so it might have originally meant sea sickness in particular.  Remembering this origin might help you spell nausea correctly too, since it ends with “sea.”  But nausea can strike on dry land just as well, from eating the wrong thing, catching the flu, reading on a moving bus . . . just thinking of it all makes me sick to my stomach."
  },
  "rancor": {
    "short": "The word rancor is best when you're not just talking about anger, you're talking about a deep, twisted bitter type of anger in your heart. The open rancor in political discussion prevents cooperation between political parties.",
    "long": "The most helpful way to remember rancor with all its dark, miserable bitterness is to think of how rancor rhymes with canker, as in canker sore, the horrible painful burning on your lip. Or, you might want to remind yourself that rancor has its roots in the word rancid meaning \"rotten.\" Rancor refers particularly to the sort of ill-will associated with resentment, envy, slow-brewing anger, and a very personal sort of hatred."
  },
  "aversion": {
    "short": "If you have an aversion to something, you have an intense dislike for it. Commonly it's food, but you could have an aversion to black and white movies, driving with the windows open, or taking calls from salespeople.",
    "long": "An aversion is also the person or thing that is the object of such intense dislike: her aversions included all kinds of vegetables and fruits. This noun is from Latin avertio, ultimately from avertere \"to turn away,\" from the prefix a- \"from\" plus vertere \"to turn.\" Near synonyms are repugnance and antipathy."
  },
  "tribute": {
    "short": "A tribute is a sign of respect or admiration, an award to honor a person's accomplishments. A famous director receives a lifetime achievement award as a tribute to his many successful films.",
    "long": "We're most familiar with the use of the word tribute meaning to honor someone with words or an award. You can hear a tribute if you're lucky enough to attend an entertainment awards ceremony, or need to attend a funeral. Students will give a retiring teacher flowers as a tribute to her years of service in education. Tribute can also mean a kind of payment that's given from one nation to another."
  },
  "capricious": {
    "short": "Capricious is an adjective to describe a person or thing that's impulsive and unpredictable, like a bride who suddenly leaves her groom standing at the wedding altar.",
    "long": "You can criticize a fickle-minded person as capricious, but it could just as well describe quickly changing weather, as in \"capricious spring storms.\" It's the adjective form of the noun caprice, which means a sudden change of mood. Caprice might come from capra, the Italian word for \"goat\" (because goats are frisky), or from capo, \"head\" + riccio, \"hedgehog.\" Why bring hedgehogs into it? If you have a \"hedgehog head,\" you are so scared that your hair is standing straight on end. A scared person makes sudden starts this way and that, just as a capricious person does."
  },
  "implode": {
    "short": "When something implodes, it explodes inward — instead of outward. With extremely large buildings, it helps to implode them rather than explode them, because by falling inward they take up less space.",
    "long": "Why bother to have a word like implode when you already have explode? Well, imagine there is something deep beneath the sea, being subjected to the intense pressure there. If the pressure is high enough that the object bursts, it would collapse in rather than out. It would, in fact, implode. People also sometimes use implode to describe a person subjected to intense pressures who, emotionally at least, bursts inward: \"All that stress just made Jess implode.\""
  },
  "acerbity": {
    "short": "A lemon in your mouth, a mean-spirited neighbor, a roomful of sarcastic people: these are examples of acerbity, a type of harsh bitterness that can leave you stunned.",
    "long": "The Latin word acerbus means “sour-tasting,” and that is acerbity in a nutshell: sour.  Many foods have acerbity, like limes and pickles. Acerbity can also be a personality trait, like a professor who snaps at you if you talk in class. In Charles Dickens’s novel A Christmas Carol, the character Ebenezer Scrooge is a great example of acerbity.  He is a bitter, stingy businessman who won’t help anyone but himself.  Don’t worry; he learns his lesson in the end."
  },
  "circumlocution": {
    "short": "Circumlocution is a long, complicated word which means a long, complicated way of expressing something. To cut to the chase, circumlocution means to beat around the bush.",
    "long": "Circumlocution comes from the Latin words circum, \"circle,\" and loqui, \"to speak.\" So circumlocution is speaking in circles, going round and round in a wordy way without ever getting to the heart of the matter. It's an evasive style of argument, best employed when you really don't want to say what's on your mind."
  },
  "construe": {
    "short": "If you interpret something or make sense of it, you construe its meaning. If the new girl in your class asks to sit with you at lunch, you could construe that she wants to be friends. You can never have too many friends!",
    "long": "To make an assumption based on evidence is to construe. You could construe that eating an entire box of cookies might make you feel a bit sick. And you might not want to eat them again for a very long time. The opposite of construe is misconstrue, which means to falsely or wrongly interpret. If you get a poor grade on an essay, you shouldn't construe that your teacher dislikes you. If you do, you misconstrue your work for his feelings."
  },
  "coy": {
    "short": "Take the adjective coy for a person who pretends to be shy but really isn't, or someone who could give a definite answer but won't. Coy behavior can be playful or just plain annoying.",
    "long": "Originally meaning \"quiet and shy,\" today someone who is coy pretends to be shy in a playful manner — often as a form of flirting. If a politician is coy about something, he or she only gives vague statements on an issue for fear of committing to a position or angering his or her constituency. Common to both of these senses is the fact that a person uses coyness to subtly manipulate his or her audience."
  },
  "opportunistic": {
    "short": "To be opportunistic is to quickly take advantage of a situation, usually in a way that's just plain wrong.",
    "long": "You know how an opportunity is a chance to do something? When you're opportunistic, you take advantage of that chance, usually immediately. Most of the time, this word is not neutral: people described as opportunistic are also considered unethical, like a business taking advantage of employees or customers in an opportunistic way. If someone dropped their wallet and someone else found it and kept it, that would be opportunistic. Being opportunistic is shady and self-serving."
  },
  "gaudy": {
    "short": "Something that's gaudy is showy, bright and definitely tacky. So think twice about that gaudy rainbow-colored suit and shiny gold shoes ensemble.",
    "long": "Gaudy is an adjective that means \"ostentatious\" — in other words, flashy and in your face, and not in a good way. Someone in a gaudy outfit is probably trying too hard to be cool and stylish. Gaudy evolved from the Middle English gaud “deception, trick” in the 1520’s. That word, in turn, came from gaudi, used to describe a “large, ornamental bead in a rosary.”"

  "genial": {
    "short": "If you're friendly and outgoing, you're genial. You can be a genial host or a genial guest.",
    "long": "This is mainly a word for pleasant kindness. Besides people or animals, climates and weather can be genial, which means they too are warm and sunny — good for growing things. In older literature, genial might have something to do with marriage and family, and sometimes brilliance, as in genius. Those uses are very rare nowadays, as is the sense of genial as having to do with the jaw. These days, warmth and friendliness are the main meanings."
  },
  "decree": {
    "short": "Look carefully! A decree isn't something you get when you graduate. That one little letter change makes it something else altogether: a legally binding command or the announcement of such a thing.",
    "long": "If you go back far enough, a decree referred to a decision handed down by the Roman emperor. In more modern usage, a divorce decree is the document issued by a court that terminates a marriage. And if you want to go out with someone on a date, but things keep preventing you from having the chance to ask, you could say that fate did not decree it to be so."
  },
  "momentous": {
    "short": "Momentous describes an important event or moment in time. It is used for a time of great consequence or for a major accomplishment, and is almost always reserved for good things.",
    "long": "When a moment is so great you know you'll never forget it, you have just experienced something momentous. It can be personal — perhaps the day you were named prom queen; or something historic — like the day Elizabeth was named Queen of England. Momentous and momentary share the root word moment but momentary describes just one fleeting moment in time. A momentary occurrence can certainly be momentous, but it's not always the case."
  },
  "transitory": {
    "short": "If something is fleeting or lasts a short time, it is transitory. Your boss declared the company's restructuring to be transitory, and promised that the company would emerge stronger and better than ever.",
    "long": "The adjective transitory describes something that is fleeting, temporary, or brief. Even a transitory storm that passes quickly can get you drenched. Consider it an honor to be on the transitory team that helps the president make a smooth transfer of power. When you met your first love, your parents thought that the relationship was transitory — but fifty years later, you're still married!"
  },
  "apprise": {
    "short": "To apprise someone about something is to fill them in, to give them the scoop. If someone in your immediate family wins the mega-bucks lottery, you want to be the first one to be apprised of that event!",
    "long": "Don't confuse the verbs apprise and appraise. Appraise means to determine the value of something — either its quality or its monetary worth. Apprise, on the other hand, means to inform or make aware. This word has a rather formal, weighty tone. Presidents get apprised of foreign affairs, but you will most likely not get apprised of weather conditions or dinner plans."
  },
  "long-winded": {
    "short": "Someone who's long-winded takes way too long to tell a story or give a speech. Once your long-winded history teacher gets started on an anecdote about the Civil War, everyone in the class sighs deeply.",
    "long": "A long-winded explanation is one that uses many words when just a few would do. And your grandfather's long-winded toasts before Thanksgiving dinner inevitably end in everyone's food getting cold before they can start eating it. An older meaning of this word was \"able to do something for a long time without losing one's breath,\" but the modern definition dates from the 1580s, when it specifically meant \"given to lengthy speeches.\""
  },
  "exclaim": {
    "short": "The verb exclaim is from the Latin word exclamare, which means \"to cry out.\" The English meaning is similar, to cry out, but with the added element of a strong emotion such as fear, joy, surprise.",
    "long": "In writing, when someone exclaims something, the punctuation mark used to express this vehement outcry is usually the exclamation point: \"Stop!\" you exclaim when your toddler climbs precariously on a chair stacked with books. \"Not in this lifetime!\" you cry out when your teenager wants to borrow the new car. You will exclaim \"I'm so proud!\" when your child graduates college."
  },
  "whet": {
    "short": "To whet is to sharpen. You could whet a knife's blade with a whetting stone, or you could whet your appetite by having some Doritos.",
    "long": "The verb whet can mean \"to stimulate or make more acute,\" and the word is often used in the phrase \"whet [your] appetite,\" which can be used literally or figuratively. You could serve light appetizers to whet everyone's appetite for dinner or you could whet an actor's appetite by giving him a small role that inspires him for greater roles. You can whet other things in this sense as well — such as curiosity, fear, or pleasure."
  },
  "enchant": {
    "short": "To enchant is to cast a spell over someone, like a witch might do. It also means to attract or catch someone's attention in a less mystical way.",
    "long": "Enchanting has a few meanings, but they all involve seduction. A witch or warlock enchants people they wish to influence through magic spells. A real person enchants in different ways: through jokes, good looks, and charisma. Not only people, but also engrossing songs or shows can be said \"to enchant.\""
  },
  "blandishment": {
    "short": "When you hear a blandishment come your way, you may feel flattered, as that's what a blandisher intends to do. However, beware because that flattery may come with the underlying intention of persuading you to do something!",
    "long": "The noun blandishment is related to the old-fashioned verb blandish meaning \"to coax with flattery, or kind words.\" A blandishment is often teasing in tone, and the intention to persuade is usually thinly veiled. Your brother may use a blandishment or two to get you to do his chores, and you're going to know exactly what he's after. But the saying \"You get more flies with honey\" just might hold true if you find yourself taking out the trash when it's not your turn."
  },
  "dilettante": {
    "short": "Though dilettante might sound like a nice French word, don't use it on your friend who thinks he can play the guitar after several short lessons. A dilettante is an amateur, often one who pretends to be very knowledgeable.",
    "long": "The meaning of dilettante has changed since it was borrowed from the Italian in the mid 1700s. Originally, it meant \"lover of the arts,\" but began to take on a negative slant as the idea of doing something as a professional took hold strongly during the 18th century. A dilettante was a mere lover of art as opposed to one who did it professionally. Today, the word implies you're pretending to be more of an artist than you're interested in or capable of being, so if you call your friend who likes to paint a dilettante, it's like you're calling him or her a poser."

    "long": "A charlatan is one who pretends to possess knowledge he or she lacks. From the 16th century Italian ciarlatano \"a quack,\" the usage of charlatan has not shifted much. Other words for charlatan are impostor, cheat, or pretender. Charlatans are marked by the elaborate schemes they cook up. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov said, \"No psychologist should pretend to understand what he does not understand...Only fools and charlatans know everything and understand nothing.\""

  "digest": {
    "short": "When your stomach breaks down food, it digests it.  To digest is to process food so it can be absorbed into the body or information so the mind can absorb it.",
    "long": "If you tell your mother some bad news, like say, that you failed your math test after studying so hard, she might say, \"Let me take a moment to digest that information.\" She's not going to swallow the paper and let her stomach do the work. Instead, she's going to take a moment to sit with the news and understand it. As a noun, a digest is a magazine that breaks down information into understandable summaries."

  "petulant": {
    "short": "Choose the adjective petulant to describe a person or behavior that is irritable in a childish way.",
    "long": "The adjective, petulant, is a disapproving term used to describe a bad-tempered child, an adult behaving like an angry child or behavior of this type. Angry or annoyed mean the same thing, but if you choose the word, petulant, you are indicating that it is unreasonable or unjustified. Petulant came to English in the late 16th century from the Latin petulantem \"forward, insolent\" but was not recorded to mean childishly irritable until the late 1700s."
  },
  "acrid": {
    "short": "Acrid is almost always used to describe a smell, and it ain't a pretty one. Acrid is the nasty sting that you feel in your nose when you walk by a building that just burned down — it's sulfur mixed with smoke.",
    "long": "You can also use acrid to describe someone's tone or general demeanor when they are being nasty. Someone about to do something evil might first give an acrid sneer, or speak in a chillingly acrid tone of voice, or even shudder as if they'd just bit into something with an acrid taste."

  "hedonistic": {
    "short": "A hedonistic person is committed to seeking sensual pleasure — the type of guy you might find in a massage parlor or at an all-you-can-eat buffet.",
    "long": "This term — along with the related words hedonist and hedonistic — is derived from the Greek word hedone, \"pleasure.\" The Cyreniacs taught that physical gratification is superior to the mental satisfaction offered by anticipation and remembrance. That's why hedonistic folks revel in pleasure, and demand it in the present tense."
  },
  "incursion": {
    "short": "When an army crosses a border into another country for battle, they are making an incursion into enemy territory. An incursion is an invasion as well as an attack.",
    "long": "Incursion can also be used to describe other things that rush in like an army such as an invasive species into a new region or floodwaters entering your home. When an airplane heads onto a runway it is not supposed to land on, risking airport safety, it is known as a runway incursion. And an incursion of cold air could make September feel like December."

  "pathogenic": {
    "short": "Something that's pathogenic makes you sick, like a virus you pick up after riding on a bus full of coughing people.",
    "long": "Pathogenic is a medical term that describes viruses, bacteria, and other types of germs that can cause some kind of disease. The flu, various parasites, and athlete's foot fungus are all considered to be pathogenic.

    "short": "Watch a bomb fulminate or explode and hope you're under safe cover. Have your parents fulminate or blow up at you for coming home past curfew and hope you're not grounded for too long.",
    "long": "The word fulminate is made up of the Latin root fulmen meaning \"lightning flash.\" Look up at the sky during a violent thunderstorm and chances are you'll catch thunder and lightning fulminate or explode loudly and violently overhead. But you needn't look to the sky alone for this kind of intensity. If you find yourself in a room with passionate Republicans and Democrats debating, you might see them fulminate or severely rail against each other's beliefs."

  "complement": {
    "short": "A complement is something that makes up a satisfying whole with something else. Those shiny red shoes you just bought complement your shiny red purse.",
    "long": "Complement comes from the Latin complementum, \"something that fills up or completes.\" Complement keeps both the e and the meaning. It's also a verb; if you and your partner complement each other, you make a perfect pair. Something that complements completes or adds a little something."
  },
  "imperative": {
    "short": "When something absolutely has to be done and cannot be put off, use the adjective imperative.",
    "long": "Imperative is from Latin imperare, \"to command,\" and its original use was for a verb form expressing a command: \"Do it!\" is an imperative sentence. The word is still used that way, but it's more commonly applied to something so pressing it cannot be put off: \"It's imperative that we hire more workers if we want to complete the job on time.\"  Imperative has more immediate force than pressing but less than urgent."
  },
  "polymath": {

    "long": "You can think of a polymath as a classic \"Renaissance man.\" Imagine Leonardo da Vinci, for example, who was not only an amazing artist, but also an engineer, inventor, mathematician, and much more. When a person's knowledge covers many different areas, he or she is a polymath. The Greek word for it is polymathes, \"having learned much,\" with poly meaning \"much,\" and manthanein meaning \"learn.\""
  },
  "conduct": {
    "short": "The noun conduct refers to behavior, like how students are rewarded for good conduct. The verb conduct means carry something through, as in \"to conduct a survey.\" And if you lead an orchestra, you conduct it.",
    "long": "Your conduct (accent on the first syllable), or your own behavior, is the way you conduct (accent on the second syllable), or lead, yourself. Keep the accent on the second syllable to conduct, or lead, an orchestra, and to conduct an interview by asking someone questions. Also, metals like copper or gold conduct electricity by letting the electricity pass through."

The verb duplicate is pronounced differently, with a long a sound, and it means to make a copy of or to multiply times two. The Latin root, duplicatus, means \"to double.\""

  "crease": {
    "short": "A crease is a fold, wrinkle, or line, like the crease in your perfectly ironed pants or the worried crease in your dad's forehead when he sees you heading out into the snow without a hat and scarf.",
    "long": "A crease can be straight and sharp — think of the creases in a folded paper airplane — or something more like a soft indentation, like the crease in your blankets telling you your cat was just there. It's a verb too: \"If you lie on the floor, you'll crease your ball gown!\" Etymologists guess that crease comes from crest and its root, which means \"to turn or bend.\""

  "revolt": {
    "short": "Revolt means to rise up against an authority in an act of rebellion. You might see an opposition group revolt against a government, or you might revolt against your oppressive 10:00 curfew.",
    "long": "Revolt has a noun form as well to describe that kind of rebellious uprising. Your revolt is successful if you get permission to stay out past 11:00. Revolt can also mean to disgust or sicken, either physically or in terms of your sensibilities. Your stomach may revolt at the idea of eating cauliflower again. You could combine the two meanings of revolt if you stage a revolt in the kitchen to stop from having to eat vegetables that revolt you."
  },
  "efficacy": {
    "short": "The degree to which a method or medicine brings about a specific result is its efficacy. You might not like to eat it, but you can't question the efficacy of broccoli as a health benefit.",
    "long": "Efficacy is a more formal way to say effectiveness, both of which stem from the Latin verb efficere \"to work out, accomplish.\" The effectiveness, or efficacy, of something is how well it works or brings the results you hoped for. A scientist does research to determine the efficacy of a vaccine or medicine under development. If it is efficacious, it will cure or prevent a disease."
  },
  "drawl": {
    "short": "A drawl is a distinctively slow, drawn-out way of talking that's especially common in the U.S. South. A writer might describe a cowboy as speaking in a lazy drawl.",
    "long": "A drawl tends to lengthen and extend vowel sounds in particular, so that words like \"pet\" or \"pen\" might be pronounced with two syllables, rather than one short one. While the Southern states are best known for inhabitants with drawls, Australian and New Zealand natives are also sometimes said to drawl. The word probably stems from the Dutch dralen, \"delay\" or \"linger.\""
  },
  "tendentious": {
    "short": "If you are writing a report on climate change and you ignore evidence that the earth is warming, the paper might be called tendentious. Tendentious means promoting a specific, and controversial, point of view.",
    "long": "When something is tendentious, it shows a bias towards a particular point of view, especially one that people disagree about. It shares a root with the word tendency, which means \"an inclination toward acting a certain way.\" If you have the tendency to talk in a tendentious manner about politics, people might tend to avoid you at parties."
  },
  "flabby": {
    "short": "If you're flabby, you're out of shape, with a soft, slack body. Some people join a gym when they're feeling a little flabby.",
    "long": "People who are flabby aren't star athletes — you may be flabby after a long, cold winter spent mostly indoors, or feel flabby as you struggle to hike up a mountain. You can describe other things as figuratively flabby too, if they're a little sloppy or weak. Flabby writing is messy and disorganized, and a flabby politician is ineffective. Flabby started as flappy, \"softly fleshy,\" in the 16th century."
  },
  "disdain": {
    "short": "If you feel that something isn't worthy of your consideration, you may disdain it (or treat it with disdain).",
    "long": "In Old French, deignier meant \"to treat something as worthy.\" To disdain something, then, is to treat it with contempt: \"Management at [the company] displayed a certain disdain for safety and appeared to regard safety-conscious workers as wimps in the organization.\" As a verb, disdain carries an air of self-righteousness not associated with similar words like despise, abhor, detest, loathe and scorn. So if you disdain something, you might reject it with a haughty scoff, \"Ha!\""
  },
  "rescind": {
    "short": "If you get a call saying a company has decided to rescind your job offer, it's back to the classifieds for you. Rescind means to cancel or revoke.",
    "long": "Things that are rescinded: policies, court decisions, regulations, and official statements. What all these examples have in common is that they are on the record. Also, rescind usually refers to promises instead of tangible objects. You can't rescind a shirt a friend has borrowed from you, but you can rescind your offer to loan her your jeans."
  },
  "aphorism": {
    "short": "Use the noun aphorism when you have something compact and astute to say, such as \"People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.\"",
    "long": "An aphorism is a statement or saying that is both efficiently presented and either witty or wise. While there are loads of trite and silly statements, a good aphorism is supposed to stand the test of time and remain true and elegant — a very difficult task! Friedrich Schlegel even wrote an aphorism about aphorisms: \"An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.\""
  },
  "ingratiate": {
    "short": "To ingratiate is to make obvious efforts to gain someone's favor, in other words — to kiss up to someone.",
    "long": "Ingratiate has not strayed much from its Latin roots, in gratiam, (in plus gratia meaning \"favor\") which means \"in favor\" or \"for the favor of.\"  To ingratiate is to gain the favor of someone by doing lots of favors to the point of being a nudge. Like the teacher's pet who answers every question, stays after class to clean the chalkboard, and brings the teacher an apple every day. When you ingratiate yourself to people, you risk annoying them — like a little dog nipping at their heels."
  },
  "herald": {
    "short": "A herald is a sign of things to come. A chilly day in October is a herald of the coming winter.",
    "long": "Years ago, a herald was an official who announced important news to the people. This is why many newspapers today have herald in their name. Nowadays, the noun herald refers to an early indicator that something is about to happen. Herald can also be used as a verb meaning \"to praise\" or \"to greet enthusiastically.\" If you've been away from home for a long time, your family might herald your return, especially if you come bearing gifts."
  },
  "usable": {
    "short": "Something that's usable can be successfully used right away for its intended purpose. If your car is usable, it's running just fine.",
    "long": "A usable tent has all of its poles and is more or less waterproof, and a usable pair of shoes fits well and doesn't have holes. Describing something as usable can sometimes be faint praise: \"Well, this basketball is usable, but just barely.\" When information is described as usable, it usually means it's actively available, and not just stored in a computer, for example. This is a relatively new adjective, first appearing around 1840."
  },
  "rumination": {
    "short": "If someone asks you to make a difficult decision — like what to have for dinner — it might lead to rumination, or a long period of deep thought.",
    "long": "Use the noun rumination when there's thoughtful consideration going on. If your grandfather answers every question by saying, \"Hmm. Let me think about that,\" he is a fan of rumination. It comes from the verb ruminate, which means \"to think deeply,\" but also means \"to chew the cud.\" Both words come from the Latin word ruminatus, which has the same meaning and which is rooted in rumen, or \"gullet.\""
  },
  "baffle": {
    "short": "To baffle is to confuse. If you are completely puzzled as to what baffle means, you might say that this word baffles you.",
    "long": "Baffle means \"confuse,\" but it can also mean \"amaze.\" A magician might baffle you with an impressive magic trick. Additionally, this verb can mean \"to spoil, thwart, or defeat by means of confusion.\" In a debate, you might baffle the opposition by introducing new information that your opponents are not familiar with. Baffle can also be used like stump. If you are stumped by a question on a test, then you’ve been baffled by that question."
  },
  "monolithic": {
    "short": "When something is monolithic it's big, and made of one thing. A large piece of stone jutting from the earth is a monolith, and Detroit's economy when it depended entirely on the auto industry was monolithic.",
    "long": "Broken into its roots mono and lithic, monolithic means simply \"one stone.\" When monolithic is used to describe something societal — like a religion or an organization — it has a slightly negative connotation. For example, a monolithic society is rigid and homogenous, not open to new ideas. Being monolithic is good for rocks, but not so good for groups of people."
  },
  "capitalism": {
    "short": "Capitalism is an economic system featuring the private ownership of business wealth and the free and unfettered operation of trade markets.",
    "long": "Capital is usually understood to be money that is put into a business, accumulated by a business, or used in some way to produce more money. In a capitalist economy, the capital is owned by private individuals, as opposed to the government or state (as in socialism or communism). Another important aspect of capitalism is the \"free market,\" where in theory natural competition always leads to innovation and price controls."
  },
  "elevator": {
    "short": "An elevator is a machine that carries passengers to higher and lower floors in a tall building. Even though you usually take the stairs to your apartment, when you're exhausted you might decide to take the elevator instead.",
    "long": "Most elevators run on electricity, although in the 19th century the first elevators used steam power to move heavy goods in coal mines. Today, elevators are legally required in tall buildings, so that people who aren't able to climb stairs have access to all floors. In the 1640's, elevator meant \"muscles used to raise the body,\" from the Latin elevator, \"one who raises up.\""
  },
  "adverse": {
    "short": "Steer clear of anything adverse. If it's adverse, it's working against you — like adverse weather conditions or the adverse effects of eating too much sugar.",
    "long": "Coming from the Latin adversus meaning \"turned against,\" adverse is an adjective describing a factor that seems to work against or actively harm something. Think of the related word, adversary, which means \"enemy or opponent,\" so that if something is adverse, it acts as if it were the enemy. If you have an adverse reaction to an antibiotic, your doctor will need to prescribe a new medication."
  },
  "complementary": {
    "short": "If something is complementary, then it somehow completes or enhances the qualities of something else. If your beautiful voice is completely complementary to your brother's song writing skills, you should form a family band!",
    "long": "You’ve probably heard of “complementary colors,” colors that are opposite in hue on the color wheel but actually go well together. When combined, they make a harmonious palette. People’s personalities can also be complementary, as can certain food pairings. But be careful not to confuse this adjective with the closely spelled complimentary, which means “supplied free of charge.”"
  },
  "ornate": {
    "short": "If something is ornate — whether it's a ball gown, a set of dishes, or a poem — it seems to be covered in ornaments. It's lavish, flowery, or heavily adorned.",
    "long": "Look at the first four letters of ornate, and you'll spot the beginning of its close relative ornament. Ornate most often describes how something looks, but it doesn't have to be visual. The prose in Victorian love letters was more ornate than the email messages people send today. The ornate gilded mirrors and enormous chandeliers in the palace at Versailles were the height of fashion in Marie Antoinette's time, but home decor is simpler today. Now, it seems too ornate."
  },
  "conflagration": {
    "short": "A conflagration isn't just a few flames; it's an especially large and destructive fire that causes devastation.",
    "long": "That tiny campfire that somehow turned into a raging forest inferno? You could call that intense, uncontrolled blaze a conflagration. Mrs. O'Leary's cow knew a thing or two about conflagrations: It was that unknowing animal that kicked over a kerosene lamp in the night, setting the O'Leary's barn on fire and sending four square miles of the Windy City into that blistering conflagration known as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871."
  },
  "cult": {
    "short": "People argue about whether the major religions of the world are just well-established cults — that, age and size aside, they are no different from any group that follows a spiritual leader.",
    "long": "A cult is group of people defined by a \"religious\" devotion to something — often a self-appointed leader. Most people view cults as strange and frightening, mostly because cults have, over the years, done some strange and frightening things, including murders and mass suicides. Sometimes, too, you'll see cult used as an adjective to describe something or someone with a small, devoted fan-base. John Water's movies are cult favorites, adored by a select group of film lovers but not by the public at large."
  },
  "pragmatic": {
    "short": "To describe a person or a solution that takes a realistic approach, consider the adjective pragmatic. The four-year-old who wants a unicorn for her birthday isn't being very pragmatic.",
    "long": "The opposite of idealistic is pragmatic, a word that describes a philosophy of \"doing what works best.\" From Greek pragma, \"deed,\" the word has historically described philosophers and politicians who were concerned more with real-world application of ideas than with abstract notions. A pragmatic person is sensible, grounded, and practical — and doesn't expect a birthday celebration filled with magical creatures."
  },
  "interregnum": {
    "short": "Interregnum describes the period between the reigns of two leaders. If you're a rebel leader, you may try to gain power during an interregnum.",
    "long": "Pronounce interregnum with the accent on the third syllable: \"in-ter-REG-num.\" It comes from Latin: inter- means \"between\" and regnum means \"kingship, dominion, rule, realm.\" An interregnum can be marked by no government at all, or it can refer to a different kind of leadership between two similar regimes."
  },
  "maudlin": {
    "short": "You can use maudlin to describe something that brings tears to your eyes, or makes you feel very emotional. Tearjerkers like \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Titanic\" can be described as maudlin.",
    "long": "Maudlin was a form of the name Mary Magdalene, a character from the Bible represented in paintings as a weeping sinner asking forgiveness from Jesus. Maudlin is often paired with sentimental, or even schlocky, to describe cry-fests, as in \"I can't watch another second of that overly-sentimental, maudlin soap opera. Turn that schlock off.\""
  },
  "metaphor": {
    "short": "If you brag that \"the world's your oyster,\" you're using a metaphor from Shakespeare, who knew a thing or two about figures of speech.",
    "long": "Good writers know their way around a metaphor, where you make an analogy between two things to show how one resembles the other in some way. When a character from Shakespeare calls the world his oyster, that's his  boastful way of saying that all the riches of the world are his for the taking, like plucking a pearl from an oyster shell. Shakespeare also wrote, \"All the world's a stage.\" Oyster? Stage? Come on, Will, get your metaphors straight!"
  },
  "swindle": {
    "short": "To swindle is to cheat or steal. You can swindle money, goods, ideas, and anything else that can be stolen, but be careful, because someone can also swindle you.",
    "long": "In the late 1700s, the verb swindle formed from swindler, which means “giddy person, cheat.” Swindle can be a noun or a verb. When you get something by less than honest means, that’s a swindle. A successful act of swindle often involves some scheme or rigging of the system. Hollywood loves a good swindle — think of all the movies that show a bank robbery or people lying about who they are.  Another funny word for swindle is bamboozle."
  },
  "stupefy": {
    "short": "Don't be embarrassed if the magician's tricks stupefy you. It means you're amazed. Who doesn't want to be stopped in his tracks sometimes?",
    "long": "Stupefy looks a lot like stupid. But intelligence has nothing to do with being stupefied, which comes from Latin and means \"to make stunned.\" Anyone can be stupefied by something scary, mysterious, or just plain remarkable. Think of tourists visiting New York City for the first time. They stare up at the skyscrapers, lost in wonder. Taking that moment to let themselves be amazed? Nothing stupid about it, unless they step on someone's foot, of course."
  },
  "remedy": {
    "short": "A remedy is something that relieves or cures a problem or illness. Aloe vera is a common remedy for sunburn.",
    "long": "If you're having trouble sleeping, the first remedy you might try is a hot bath and a cup of chamomile tea. If that doesn't help, you may resort to something stronger, like a sedative. If a streetlight shining in your window is part of the problem, you can remedy the situation with some room-darkening shades. But if it's your upstairs neighbors and their all-night partying that's keeping you awake, you may have to consider a legal remedy."
  },
  "haphazard": {
    "short": "Anything haphazard is random, disorganized, slipshod, or hit-or-miss. A tent erected haphazardly might look more like a big nylon bag of dirty laundry than a place to sleep.",
    "long": "Ever heard the expression \"I'll hazard a guess?\" In it, the word hazard means \"chance,\" as in \"take a chance.\"  Think of the hap in haphazard as short for \"happen.\" Combine hap- and -hazard and you get something that happens (or appears to have happened) by chance. If you approach a math problem with haphazard reasoning, you're likely to get it wrong."
  },
  "paean": {
    "short": "A paean is a hymn of praise or thanksgiving. You might sing a paean in church, where many hymns extol the greatness of God.",
    "long": "Paean was originally a song of praise for Apollo, or Paian as he was sometimes called. You can now use paean to mean any song of praise, regardless of the deity, or to mean a formal expression of praise, like a eulogy. At your mother's birthday dinner, it might be nice for you and your brothers and sisters to write and sing a paean to her good-natured love and support of you over many years."
  },
  "consternate": {
    "short": "To consternate someone is to worry or alarm them. If your talented pitcher suddenly loses the ability to pitch a single strike, it will consternate the other players on your softball team.",
    "long": "Things that consternate you cause you concern and dismay, sending you into a startled state of confusion. The word comes from the Latin consternat- (\"terrified or prostrated\"), which derives from another word meaning \"throw down.\" If something is so disorienting and anxiety-provoking that you feel you've been flung to the ground, it consternates you. A pop quiz in your hardest class might consternate you, as might suddenly remembering you have to give a speech you haven't prepared for."
  },
  "unequivocal": {
    "short": "If there is no doubt about it, it's unequivocal. An unequivocal response to a marriage proposal? \"Yes. Yes! A thousand times yes!\"",
    "long": "Equivocal is from a Latin word meaning of equal voice, so unequivocal means of unequal voice — unmistakable, unambiguous, without question. There might be unequivocal evidence tying a suspect to a crime, or unequivocal support for a popular leader. If you explain something in unequivocal terms, then your words should be clear to everyone."
  },
  "temporal": {
    "short": "Our time on earth is limited, or temporal.",
    "long": "Temporal comes from the Latin word temporalis which means \"of time\" and is usually applied to words that mean not having much of it, such as the temp who works at an office for a set amount of time, because temporary situations don't last long. A less common word, temporality also means \"having limited time,\" and it rhymes with mortality! (Don't remind us.) Temporal implies \"of this earth,\" too — temporal boundaries keep us from being able to fly around the clouds, but spiritual beings can zing around at will. Temporal can also refer to temples, the ones on the side of your head that are probably aching by now."
  },
  "rampant": {
    "short": "Rampant means wild or out of control. Unruly children might run rampant at the supermarket, knocking cereal boxes off shelves and thoroughly annoying the customers.",
    "long": "If you're running rampant, you're on a rampage. Both come from the French word ramper meaning \"to climb, creep\" like an animal on hind legs, paws in climbing-mode, or like wild plants such as the kudzu that ran rampant over an old barn until the entire thing was covered. There can also be rampant wildfires that destroy houses in the Southwest, or robots that run rampant in the lab after the janitor accidentally sets them free."
  },
  "guileless": {
    "short": "If you are guileless, you are not a liar; you are innocent, and you might be a touch on the gullible side.",
    "long": "To be guileless is to be without guile. Guile is \"deceit, duplicity and trickery.\" The young and uninitiated are the ones we call guileless, and they are the ones who often get stung by the more heartless among us. You might recall being a guileless freshman trying out for the school play, and being told by a veteran performer that it would be best to come to the audition for Our Town in a chicken costume, so you did."
  },
  "truculence": {
    "short": "If you get into fights all of the time, you might be accused of truculence and sent for anger management classes. Truculence is showing a fierce kind of aggression.",
    "long": "If your basketball team wins a game by sheer truculence, it means that they win not by skill or talent, but by playing with ferocious aggression. It would be a dirty win, one with lots of fouls and thrown elbows. Truculence comes from the Latin word for trux meaning \"fierce or wild.\""
  },
  "vim": {
    "short": "Vim is energy and enthusiasm. If you've got vim, then you probably pack a little extra oomph in your life!",
    "long": "Vim is an odd-looking word, but it stands for a simple concept: being ready for activity, especially vigorous activity. Someone who is always playing sports or going on trips is full of vim. Someone who lies on the couch watching TV all day shows very little vim. This word often appears in the phrase \"vim and vigor.\" If you have vim, you have energy and you're ready to put that energy into all sorts of activities; you're up for anything."
  },
  "sovereign": {
    "short": "Put simply, your sovereign is your king or queen. George III was the sovereign of Great Britain and her colonies — including the American ones. At least he was until a little thing called the Revolutionary War upset everything.",
    "long": "Sovereign as an adjective can be used to indicate the ultimate power of a state, whether a monarchy or not, as in \"Peru exercised its sovereign rights to all minerals within its borders.\" A sovereign is also a British gold coin with a face value of one pound sterling (with the monarch's face on it). But don't sell it for a pound, because it's worth its weight in gold — quite literally — which is a lot more than a pound is worth."
  },
  "variability": {
    "short": "The weather in San Francisco is known for its variability. One minute it's summer and the next, winter. Variability means the tendency to shift or change — of being \"variable.\"",
    "long": "There are many words that contain vari-, and they almost all have to do with change or difference. Variability is the noun version of this idea. The variability of the weather means that you never know exactly what to wear. T-shirt or sweater: the choices vary along with the weather. Many things are known for their variability: the taste of teenagers, the talent of the singers on \"American Idol,\" Frank Sinatra's moods. These are just some of the things that exhibit real variability."
  },
  "schism": {
    "short": "The sound of the word schism reminds some people of the sound of a piece of paper being torn in two; which makes sense –– when a group has a big fight and the group is torn in two, that's a schism.",
    "long": "Although the Spanish club could have a schism over taco night versus tamale fest, schism often refers to splits in the church. You might have heard of the Great Schism of 1074, when the eastern Christian church, headquartered in Byzantium (now Istanbul), broke away from the western one headquartered in Rome."
  },
  "erroneous": {
    "short": "The adjective erroneous describes something or someone as mistaken and incorrect. Early explorers had the erroneous notion that the oceans were full of dragons.",
    "long": "When we talk about being on the \"straight and narrow path\" we aim to live a truthful and moral life. The Latin root of erroneous, or \"to be incorrect\" as well as \"to be immoral,\" is errare, which means \"to wander.\" It's clear that we make connections between behavior and direction or space. These two ideas have been linked for a very long time!"

  "trepidation": {
    "short": "When plain old \"fear\" isn't enough to get across a deep feeling of dread about something on the horizon, use the more formal word trepidation.",
    "long": "\"It was with a certain trepidation that I attended an advance screening of Rob Zombie's Halloween in Hollywood last night,\" wrote a film reviewer. Some dictionaries note that trepidation carries connotations of apprehension about an upcoming threat. In most cases, though, you can get by with the simpler word  fear — why use three syllables when you could make do with one? The word comes from the Latin verb trepidare, \"to tremble.\""
  },
  "harrow": {
    "short": "To harrow is to cause worry and upset, the way a truly scary movie might harrow you, making it hard to sleep without turning on the light.",
    "long": "Harrow is an uncommon verb that was originally used in a religious context. You're much more likely to hear the adjective harrowing used for things that are extremely distressing. But if your cat torments you nightly with her incessant meowing, you might try yelling, \"Why do you harrow me?\" In agriculture, harrow has a completely different meaning: it's a device that helps up break up the soil. And if you harrow your land, you use such a device."
  },
  "destitute": {
    "short": "When you think of the word destitute, which means poor or lacking other necessities of life, think of someone who is in desperate straits. A very, very tight budget is poor. Living on the streets is destitute.",
    "long": "Destitute essentially means not having something. When you're destitute in the sense of being poor, you're technically \"destitute of money.\" You can be destitute of other things as well. If all your friends have abandoned you, you're \"destitute of friends.\" If you are applying for a job as a waitress but have never worked in a restaurant in any capacity, you're \"destitute of experience.\""
  },
  "exhaustive": {
    "short": "Exhaustive means performed comprehensively and completely. When you recruit a new employee (or spouse), you undertake an exhaustive search for the best talent.",
    "long": "When you are exhaustive about something, you are testing all possibilities or considering all elements. If you want to become an attorney you will need an exhaustive knowledge of the leather bound books in the law library. When you exhaust something, you use it up entirely, so something exhaustive is complete. After your exhaustive tour of Rome, you're exhausted."
  },
  "malign": {
    "short": "If you malign someone, you badmouth them — just like the jilted girlfriend who tells the whole school her ex has bad breath and head lice.",
    "long": "When you habitually malign people, you risk being described as \"a malign influence\" — in this case, malign is an adjective that describes a harmful or even evil person or thing. Whichever way you use the word, its connection to wickedness can be found in its Latin root, malignus, \"wicked or bad-natured,\" which combines male, or \"badly\" and -gnus, \"born.\""
  },
  "ineluctable": {
    "short": "Huh? Are you scratching your head at this word? The ineluctable conclusion is that you haven't the faintest idea what it means. Ineluctable means impossible to avoid.",
    "long": "A five syllable beauty like ineluctable is obviously not the kind of word you throw around in daily speech. It's far more often used as a written word, as in the common phrase \"ineluctable conclusion.\" Used interchangeably with the more common unavoidable, though ineluctable implies an unsuccessful attempt to battle against whatever is ineluctable: after all, it comes from the Latin word \"to struggle.\""
  },
  "gambol": {
    "short": "To gambol is to run around playing excitedly. Although the word sounds like \"gamble,\" when you gambol you never lose — you just have a great time!",
    "long": "If you've ever sprinted around, jumping up and down, yelling \"woo-hoo!,\" you already know how to gambol. Being really excited or even just slap-happy makes people gambol, and it's so energizing that animals do it too. Dogs gambol when they rise on two legs to greet each other, and squirrels gambol when they chase each other up and down trees. And when springtime comes after a long winter, it seems to make every living thing gambol with extra life."

  "unwieldy": {
    "short": "If you see an unwieldy person coming down the aisle of the bus with an unwieldy box, you may want to step aside because that's a double dose of clumsy. It's an awkward person carrying a box that is difficult to manage.",
    "long": "Something that is wieldy is easy to control or handle, so something unwieldy is not. However, the un- form of the word is much more common. The base word wieldy has its roots in Old English, meaning \"to handle or control\" — used usually in reference to a weapon. You would not want an unwieldy person attempting to wield an unwieldy sword!"

  "pugnacious": {
    "short": "Pugnacious means ready for a fight. If you're pugnacious, you might find it hard to make friends. On the other hand, you might be a very successful professional boxer one day.",
    "long": "Your brother is a pugnacious thug — always ready to use his fists to settle arguments, and he has the strength to do so. That’s the literal sense of pugnacious. You can use pugnacious figuratively, too. When two candidates face off in a debate during a close election, one or the other might be pugnacious. He looks to pick a fight with his opponent and is willing to say almost anything, no matter how outrageous, to make his opponent look bad."
  },
  "vulgar": {
    "short": "Someone who's vulgar has bad taste, and could also be called unrefined or unsophisticated. Your snobby neighbor might mutter about your family's vulgar taste if you paint your house with hot pink stripes.",
    "long": "From the Latin vulgus, meaning \"the common people,\" vulgar is an adjective that can describe anything from the sexually explicit to the merely ugly and crass. A crude joke could be considered vulgar, as could a breach of etiquette at a dinner party. Your dad might love the lights and glamour of Times Square, while your mom finds all the brightly colored corporate logos to be vulgar."
  },
  "holocaust": {
    "short": "The noun holocaust means \"total destruction.\" However, this word has become inextricably connected with World War II and the mass murder of Jews by the Nazis (in this usage, Holocaust is capitalized).",
    "long": "When holocaust entered the English language in the thirteenth century, it referred to burnt offerings described in the Old Testament. The original Greek word meant \"burnt whole\" (note the relationship to the word caustic). Since at least 1942, though, the word is most often used to describe the extermination of Jews by the Nazis. Some people object to the religious connotations of the word, though, preferring to use the Hebrew Shoah (catastrophe) instead."
  },
  "flaunt": {
    "short": "Flaunt is \"to display proudly or show off,\" like when you flaunt your new Italian leather jacket by wearing it to the beach and pretending you're cold to make sure everyone sees it.",
    "long": "Although we love it when a peacock flaunts his colorful feathers, when a person does the same thing we feel bad. Flaunt is like bragging, which can bum people out because they don't have whatever you're showing off, like that cool jacket. When rich people flaunt their wealth by speeding past you in their limo, they may as well splash a mud puddle on your white clothes. Leave the flaunting for peacocks and stars in bad reality TV shows."
  },
  "puissance": {
    "short": "Puissance is the power to influence what other people do or believe. A celebrity who is extremely popular with teens has puissance to help end problems like bullying just by talking about it in interviews.",
    "long": "Puissance is a French word that describes being powerful. When you have a strong influence over someone, you have puissance. It's an uncommon but poetic way to describe power, especially the power to convince someone to do something, like an older sibling's puissance. Another meaning of puissance is a show jumping horse's ability to jump large hurdles."
  },
  "vital": {
    "short": "A patient's vital signs are their important body functions, such as pulse rate, that shows they are still alive. Use the adjective vital to describe something that is important and necessary, or a person full of energy.",
    "long": "Vital descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Latin vītālis, from vīta, \"life.\" If you are vital to the organization you work for, it means they cannot live without you — or at least that you're an important part of the team. If you're a vital force in your church volunteer group, you probably are a leader with lots of energy to give."
  },
  "rhetorical": {
    "short": "If you ask a rhetorical question it means you don’t necessarily expect an answer, but you do want an occasion to talk about something.",
    "long": "Rhetoric is the art of written or spoken communication. If you went to school a hundred years ago, your English class would have been called Rhetoric. But nowadays if we say something is rhetorical, we usually mean that it’s only good for talking. If you speak beautifully about carpentry but can’t ever actually build a cabinet, we might say you have lots of rhetorical flare, but very little real skill."
  },
  "umbrage": {
    "short": "When someone takes umbrage at something, they find it offensive, and it probably makes them angry.",
    "long": "Umbrage comes from the same source as umbrella, the Latin umbra, \"shade, shadow.\" The umbrella was invented to keep you in shade, and when you take umbrage at something, you're casting a shadow over the person or thing responsible for the offense. I take umbrage at the suggestion that I'm not a nice person: it's offensive and infuriating. After having devoted my life to helping animals, I might take umbrage at the notion that I've been doing it for publicity purposes: I resent the idea that it was for any other reason than my love of animals."
  },
  "animus": {
    "short": "Saying you have animus toward a person is a fancy way of saying that you hate their guts. You could also say that an animus exists between two people. That's when they hate each others' guts.",
    "long": "If you're familiar with the word animosity, meaning bad feelings, you're only a hop, skip, or jump away from understanding animus. But then it gets tricky. The word can also mean a motivating force — you could refer to the fear of infection as the animus behind a movement to sterilize public buildings."
  },
  "conspicuous": {
    "short": "Keep your eye on the adjective conspicuous for something that stands out so much you notice it right away — like that zit in the center of your friend's forehead.",
    "long": "Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb, conspicere, meaning \"to look at.\" Conspicuous can mean either very obvious to the eye (like something that is conspicuous from a distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If you are doing something wrong, it's wise not to be conspicuous about it!"
  },
  "waver": {
    "short": "To waver is to move back and forth, like when you waver, one minute thinking you'll stay home, planning to go meet your friends the next, until you finally make your decision.",
    "long": "Waver comes from the Old English word wæfre, which means “restless.” When the wind blows, it makes the leaves and flowers waver, or move, in that same direction. A person who wavers is much the same — affected by any influence or change. He or she isn't sure what to do or may be too shy to express a preference until time is just about up and a decision must be made."
  },
  "defamatory": {
    "short": "Defamatory is a word used to describe statements that are untrue, slanderous, or libelous. Defamatory language often consists of harmful lies.",
    "long": "Defamatory words — that is, words which defame — are words that can cause real damage. If someone said you were a secret unicorn hunter, that would be a silly, not defamatory, lie. If someone said you were a thief or a traitor, and you weren't, that would be defamatory. Public figures, like celebrities and politicians, are especially sensitive to defamatory statements about them."
  },
  "emanate": {
    "short": "Emanate means to give off, like the sound of laughter that emanates from your sister's room during her slumber party. If spooky sounds emanate from the closet, don’t open the door!",
    "long": "The word emanate comes from the Latin emanare, which means “to flow out.” Things that emanate come from somewhere. Heat emanates from a fire, and smoke emanates from a chimney. This word can also be used figuratively: for example, you might say that your upbeat and optimistic best friend emanates positivity."
  },
  "order": {
    "short": "Order is the formal arrangement of things — putting that pile of paper on your desk into neat stacks of bills, papers, letters, to-do lists and napkin poems.",
    "long": "Order has many meanings. You can put a line of people in order from tallest to shortest, or from youngest to oldest. As a very, order also means command: Talk out of turn in court and the judge will order you to be quiet. In a restaurant you give the waiter your order, which is what you want to eat, not your idea of how to organize the pantry. An order is also a group, like the Freemasons or the Order of St. Benedict."
  },
  "insubordinate": {
    "short": "If you want to be insubordinate, go ahead and break the rules, ignore orders, and act like a disobedient rebel.",
    "long": "Words that have similar meanings to insubordinate include \"rebellious\" and \"mutinous.\" But while insubordinate people don't follow orders, rebellious folks openly defy them and mutinous groups try to overthrow the authority that created them. When baseball player Jackie Robinson objected to racial discrimination in the Army in the 1940s, he was accused of being insubordinate. He was court martialed, but found innocent and acquitted."
  },
  "exorbitant": {
    "short": "Use the adjective exorbitant when you want to describe something that is really just too much! You'll often hear people griping about exorbitant bank fees or exorbitant interest rates.",
    "long": "The adjective exorbitant was originally a legal term to describe a case that was outside the bounds of the law. It comes from the Latin roots — the prefix ex, meaning \"out of,\" and orbita, meaning \"wheel track.\" You can see how the word now has come to be described as something that has gone way off the beaten track, especially in terms of price and value."
  },
  "aptitude": {
    "short": "An aptitude is something you're good at. A rock star might have an aptitude for energizing an audience, or for trashing his hotel room.",
    "long": "When you have a talent or do something well, people say that you have an aptitude for it. But you don't have to be born with an aptitude; you can also acquire your abilities. You are probably already well acquainted with this word, since the zillions of standardized tests you have taken in school are usually called aptitude tests."
  },
  "unfathomable": {
    "short": "Unfathomable means impossible to ever understand. For most people, the field of quantum mechanics is unfathomable.",
    "long": "Fathoms are seafaring units of measure equaling about six feet. So something that is unfathomable is also immeasurable, especially when it comes to depth. If your sonar isn't bouncing anything back to you, you're dealing with an unfathomable distance. Metaphorically, unfathomable can refer to something that resembles an abyss, some figurative notion that's so deep you can't even measure it."
  },
  "malfeasance": {
    "short": "Whenever you see the prefix \"mal-,\" you know it's not good. Malfeasance is bad behavior, especially from officials or people who should know better.",
    "long": "If nothing else, the mal- in malfeasance will alert you to the fact that something bad is going on. If you know French, fease-, faise- will ring a bell, as it often means \"to do.\" You can probably then infer that malfeasance means \"to do bad.\" Today, it's usually a bad deed done by an official or an organization. You wouldn't accuse a dog who peed on the carpet of malfeasance, but you would accuse a mayor who took a bribe of malfeasance."
  },
  "luxuriant": {
    "short": "You can use the adjective luxuriant to describe something really luxurious or full and lush. If you walk through a dense forest after it rains, it's really luxuriant with green plants overgrowing the paths.",
    "long": "Natural, growing things are luxuriant when they're fertile and full of life. People and places that show a fullness of life and wealth are also luxuriant. If you enter a room full of deep, plush couches and expensive decorations you're in a luxuriant space. And anything really enjoyable to the senses — whether costly or not — can be luxuriant, like a really rich and creamy piece of warm vanilla cake with a large hot chocolate: that's luxuriant."
  },
  "nadir": {
    "short": "If a highly forgetful person loses his phone, his wallet, and then his car keys in separate instances all in one day, you could say that he has reached an organizational nadir. This means “lowest point.”",
    "long": "This was originally strictly an astronomical term and is the opposite of the word zenith, which is the part of the sky located directly above a person’s head or, “high point.”  In fact, nadir is derived from the Arabic nazir, which means “opposite to.” It is still used in astronomy to indicate the part of the celestial sphere located directly below an observer, but also more generally to describe the worst point of someone’s life or career."
  },
  "democracy": {
    "short": "Whether you're talking about your glee club or a powerful nation, the word democracy describes government based on participation of the people, either directly or through elected representatives.",
    "long": "Democracy traces back to the Greek words demos, meaning \"people,\" and kratia, meaning \"power.\" \"People power\" remains central to democracy, whether you're describing a country or a much smaller organization. If your glee club is run as a democracy, then everybody gets to vote on questions like what you're going to sing and what kind of outfits you’re going to wear. Because democracy assumes some idea of equality, it's often used to mean a just society, one in which everyone is treated equally."
  },
  "ingest": {
    "short": "When you ingest something, you swallow it or otherwise consume it. If you don't ingest enough iron, you'll feel tired and weak and you'll look pale.",
    "long": "Trees ingest carbon dioxide, and humans ingest the oxygen that trees in turn produce. We also ingest a lot of other things, like French fries, ice cream, and root beer. You can also use this word to mean \"take in information,\" like when you ingest the details of your history book. Ingest has a Latin root, ingestus, \"poured in,\" from in-, \"into,\" and gerere, \"to carry.\""
  },
  "peddle": {
    "short": "When you peddle something, you go out and try to sell it. It's cute when a little kid peddles his homemade birthday cards around the neighborhood, but if an adult did that it might be annoying.",
    "long": "The classic image of someone who peddles is an old-fashioned \"peddler\" or \"tinker\" traveling from village to village selling goods. The verb peddle, in fact, comes from the word \"peddler,\" whose origin is a mystery. Any time you sell something by going from place to place, like selling Girl Scout cookies to all your neighbors, you peddle."

  },
  "deprecate": {
    "short": "To deprecate is to show disapproval or to make someone feel unimportant by speaking to them disrespectfully, like seniors who deprecate younger students just for fun.",
    "long": "To deprecate is to diminish, or to oppose, like when someone deprecates your dream of climbing Mt. Everest by calling it \"a little walk up a hill.\" Some people deprecate themselves, which is called being self-deprecating. People who are self-deprecating downplay their abilities because they are humble — or want to appear that way. So if you do climb Everest and you are self-deprecating, you'll say it wasn't such a big deal, even if it was the proudest moment of your life."
  },
  "equilibrium": {
    "short": "Equilibrium is a state of balance. If you play sports so much that you don't have time for your studies, you need to study more and play less, until sports and studying reach a point of equilibrium. Or become a professional athlete.",
    "long": "The word equilibrium is commonly used to refer to mental or emotional balance, and a near synonym in this sense is composure. In chemistry, equilibrium is the condition existing when a chemical reaction and its reverse reaction occur at equal rates. This noun is from Latin aequilībrium, from the prefix aequi- \"equal\" plus lībra \"a balance, scale.\""
  },
  "conifer": {
    "short": "A conifer is a type of tree that produces cones and evergreen needles. Spot a pile of cones beneath a tree and you've found yourself a conifer.",
    "long": "With the word cone embedded in it, it's no surprise that conifer is the term used for cone-producing trees. Conifers can often be identified by their typically long needle-shaped leaves like the kind you find on a Christmas tree. Mostly found in northern forests where the winters are cold, the tough prickly leaves on conifers make them adaptable to the weather."
  },
  "extol": {
    "short": "If you have a crush on a guy who likes your best friend, it can be very depressing to listen to him extol your friend's virtues, while you just nod and smile. If you extol something, you praise it very highly.",
    "long": "The Bible says: \"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven...\" Nebuchadnezzar II was king of the second Babylonian Empire, the one who sent the Jews into exile. In some translations of the Bible, the word honor is replaced with glorify. Praise, extol, honor, glorify all mean about the same. The Bible often uses five words when one would be enough."
  },
  "conjunction": {
    "short": "\"Conjunction Junction, what's your function? Hooking up words and phrases and clauses.\" These lyrics from Schoolhouse Rock sum it up: a conjunction is all about joining things together.",
    "long": "The words and, but, and or are conjunctions, linking words and phrases together to form sentences. Other kinds of conjunctions bring groups together, such as organizations working in conjunction to present a big event; or bring objects together, like a conjunction in a house's plumbing system where pipes meet. Conjunction could also mean things happening at the same time, such as free Schoolhouse Rock screenings that are presented in conjunction with a National Grammar Day celebration."
  },
  "lizard": {
    "short": "A lizard is a type of reptile that has scales for skin, a long body, a pointy tail, and usually four legs.  And they breathe fire.  Okay, maybe not that last part, but that would be awesome.",
    "long": "Lizards can be smaller than an inch long, or massive in size and weight — like the Komodo dragon, which can grow over ten feet in length.  A type of lizard called a chameleon can change colors whenever it wants, and the Jesus lizard can walk on water.  Most lizards live in deserts or jungles, however the word lizard comes from the Latin lacertus, which means “sea fish” — perhaps because they look like a monster that crawled out of the ocean."
  },
  "interplay": {
    "short": "Interplay is a kind of back-and-forth interaction in which each side affects the other. A beautiful piece of music has the perfect interplay between melody, rhythm, and harmony.",
    "long": "You can think of interplay as if you're watching an actual play on a stage: the way two characters communicate, whether they're cooperating or clashing with each other, is a kind of interplay. This word is often used in a less concrete way, so you might hear a sociologist talk about the interplay between race and class or a film critic discuss the interplay between violence and comedy in a movie."

  "ardent": {
    "short": "If you are ardent, you are passionate about something. A pop star's ardent admirers might go so crazy at his concert that they faint from excitement.",
    "long": "Ardent is most often used to modify words like supporter, fan, advocate, admirer, and defender — but also opponent. Although you can either ardently support or oppose something, \"support\" appears more often in common usage. The word literally means \"burning\" or \"glowing\" — it's from the Latin verb ardere, \"to burn.\" In poetic use, the word is sometimes used to mean \"glowing,\" as Alexander Pope meant it in his 1718 translation of Homer's Iliad: \"From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes.\""
  },
  "notion": {
    "short": "If you have a notion that you can swim across the ocean, you are probably wrong. A notion is an idea, often vague and sometimes fanciful.",
    "long": "A notion is lighter than a theory and embraces a whimsy that a simple idea never could. You might have the notion that you can slow global warming by taking public transportation and reusing plastic bags. If you share a far-fetched idea with others, someone might respond with a \"Where'd you get that notion?!\" Notions can also refer to the buttons, thread, zippers, and pins necessary for sewing things. So if you have a notion to create your own Halloween costume, you better pick up some notions from the craft store."
  },
  "outline": {
    "short": "The gist, the essence, the major parts of something — that's its outline.",
    "long": "The origins of outline come from the artistic practice of marking a line around the outer edge of a person or shape in a picture before filling it in. Only later, in the 1800s, did it come to be applied to verbal descriptions, too. Technically an outline suggests a condensed form of something, but as any high school or college student knows, course outlines have a habit of being pretty darn long. In 1919 H.G. Wells wrote a book called An Outline of History. Its length? 1,324 pages."
  },
  "protect": {
    "short": "Whether it’s your reputation or your jewelry, when you protect something you keep it safe from anything that might threaten or harm it.",
    "long": "The word protect came into English by way of the Latin verb protegere, a combination of pro- meaning “in front,” and tegere, meaning “to cover.” When you protect something, in a way you’re covering it or shielding it from harm. Often the word is used in the sense of protecting something, like a valued item or a person, but you can also protect against something. For example, you might get a flu shot to protect against the flu virus."
  },
  "prohibitive": {
    "short": "That expensive Ferrari in the showroom? You may want it, but its price is prohibitive — which means the price is discouragingly high and likely to deter you from buying.",
    "long": "Prohibitive originally referred to something (often a law) that prohibits or forbids something, but it came to mean conditions (often prices or taxes) so high or great they restrict or prevent something: \"To some, the cost of child care is prohibitive.\" The stress is on the second syllable, just like the verb: pro-HIB-i-tive. If it's a matter of expense, a synonym is exorbitant."
  },
  "latitude": {
    "short": "Use the word latitude to describe how much freedom you have in making choices. For example, if a teacher gives you latitude in writing your paper, you might get to choose the topic and how many sources to include.",
    "long": "Latitude is related to the Latin word latitudo, meaning \"breadth, width, extent, size.\" You might already know that latitude is used to indicate the distance an object is from the equator, measured from north to south. Latitude can also be used to mean \"be given the space to act and decide for oneself,\" like the latitude parents might give responsible kids."

    "long": "In the military, a corporal is a soldier who rose through the ranks as an enlisted soldier, not going to one of the military colleges. Elsewhere, this word has to do with physical things and beings. A ghost is not corporal — it has no body. In a horror movie, corporal monsters like zombies and vampires can do more damage. You can also talk about corporal pleasures, like eating and drinking. When you see the word corporal (or corporeal), think body."
  },
  "qualified": {
    "short": "Qualified means something depends on another action occurring. If your friend receives a qualified offer on her house, that means something else has to happen — like a bank approving the loan — before it's sold.",
    "long": "Qualified is an adjective with multiple meanings. Employers seek the most qualified applicants, meaning those who have the most experience and relevant training. Being qualified might also mean you have paperwork that shows you had certain training or meet certain standards. Or qualified can mean \"partial\" or \"incomplete.\" If you approve of something but others need to agree before it's final, you would give your qualified approval."
  },
  "categorical": {
    "short": "If someone accuses you of stealing their lunch and you give a categorical denial, it means that you absolutely deny having anything to do with the theft. Categorical means absolute, unqualified, unconditional.",
    "long": "If you ask someone to marry you and she says maybe, you might be able to persuade her. If it's no, you might still have a chance. But if she gives you a categorical no, she will never change her mind. Less often, categorical is used to describe something that is part of a certain category or group. A Doberman at the Westminster Dog Show might be the categorical winner, meaning it is the best Doberman but not the winner of the show."

  "placate": {

    "long": "If your little sister is mad that the dog ate her favorite teddy bear, you could placate her by buying her an ice cream cone. A near synonym for placate is appease. The origin of placate is Latin placare, \"to calm or soothe.\" The related Latin verb placere is the source of English please."

  "preface": {

    "long": "The preface is a place for extra context, thoughts, or even disclaimers about the text that follows. In his preface to Lyrical Ballads, the famous poet William Wordsworth wrote, “The majority of the following poems are to be considered as experiments.” In other words, “Don’t judge me too harshly!” Preface can also be used as a verb meaning \"introduce.\" When you preface a statement with, “No offense but... ,” the person you’re talking to braces for criticism."

  },
  "fatuous": {
    "short": "Fatuous means lacking intelligence. When your mother outlaws calling your brother stupid, use fatuous instead.",
    "long": "Fatuous derives from the Latin fatuus meaning \"foolish.\" It sounds like it should have something to do with being fat, but it actually has no relation to size. Fatuus itself comes from a root that also gave us \"debate\" and this might be a good way to remember it. You want to debate someone who's fatuous, because they are unintelligent, silly and even a bit conceited, so they probably won't be very persuasive debaters. Just don't call them fatuous to their face. Even if they don't know what it means, it's just not nice!"
  },
  "sketchy": {
    "short": "Something sketchy is incomplete: it includes the major points but lacks detail. If a political candidate avoids going into detail about her political views, you might say her platform is sketchy.",
    "long": "A sketch is a quick drawing that doesn't have a lot of detail. That definition should help you remember that sketchy things are incomplete. A sketchy speech from the President will outline some important ideas but be short on specifics. A sketchy plan for the weekend would be \"Let's go out to eat.\" That's sketchy because it has the general idea but no specifics, such as the time or place."

  "hysteria": {
    "short": "Hysteria is a medical condition or general state of extreme fear and panic. When hysteria sets in, people are out of control.",
    "long": "In a medical sense, people who are feeling hysteria may be violent and having trouble perceiving reality. In a more general sense, when someone is hysterical, they're out of control — freaking out. Hysteria is the opposite of calmness. It's really a state of emotional chaos that often takes over during natural disasters and scary moments. Or if you're a 13 year old girl, when you go to a concert for your favorite boy band."

    "long": "Vex can be used as an adjective: for example, a vexing issue is not easily solved. The verb vex, the corresponding adjective vexatious, and the noun vexation are all slightly old-fashioned though still in current use. Vex descends through Middle English from Latin vexare, \"to shake, attack, trouble.\""

  "levity": {
    "short": "Joking that your dead grandmother \"never looked better\" could inject some levity, or frivolity, into her funeral, but your relatives might find your joke inappropriate to the occasion.",
    "long": "Levity literally means \"lightness,\" and it's often an attempt to inject some lightness or humor into an otherwise somber situation. Telling your Aunt Edna a joke while she recuperates from a skiing accident could provide the levity needed to brighten her mood.

  "dilate": {
    "short": "To dilate something is to make it wider. When the light fades, the pupil of your eye will dilate, meaning it looks bigger.",
    "long": "The verb dilate comes from the Latin word dilatare, which means “enlarge” or “spread out.” When something stretches, expands, or becomes wider, it is said to dilate. Usually the word dilate is used when the opening of something circular becomes larger, but every so often you might hear someone refer to the need to dilate someone's understanding of quantum physics, global warming, livestock breeding, or any other topic."

  "honorific": {
    "short": "If you greet your bus driver every day by saying, \"Good Morning, Ms. Smith!\" then you're familiar with honorifics, the respectful titles we add to people's names. In Ms. Smith's case, the honorific is Ms.",
    "long": "The most common honorifics in English are the ones we put in front of names, like Mr., Dr., and Reverend and even new coinages like the gender-neutral Mx., which was first attested in the late 1970s. There are military honorifics such as Captain and General, and religious honorifics, including Rabbi, Father, and Imam. Some honorifics come at the end of a person's name: \"Mateo Garcia, PhD,\" and \"Angela Smith, DDS,\" for example. The word honorific is also an adjective meaning \"showing respect,\" as in an honorific award or an honorific title."

  "cave": {
    "short": "A cave is hollow space underground that's big enough for a person to walk or crawl into. People who explore caves often wear battery-powered headlamps.",
    "long": "You might see a small cave in the side of a cliff as you hike up a mountain, or swim into an underwater cave when you go snorkeling. In either case, a cave is a deep, carved-out chamber that opens above ground — or in the water. People who regularly explore caves are called spelunkers, or cavers. The Latin root word is cavea, \"hollow.\""
  },
  "composure": {
    "short": "When you stay calm under pressure, you keep your composure. Keeping your composure for a skinned knee? Easy. Keeping your composure during an avalanche? Not so easy.",
    "long": "The word composure is from the related word composed, but don't think of the word in the musical sense. In this case, composed means calm. What's the difference between the two? Well, composed is an adjective, so you simply are composed. Composure, on the other hand, is a noun, so you can lose, keep, regain, or maintain your composure — your ability to stay calm. If you lose your composure, you're freaking out."
  },
  "problematic": {
    "short": "Something problematic poses a problem or causes difficulties. Your ambitions to become the next great leader of Spain are great, but your inability to speak Spanish might prove problematic.",
    "long": "Around 1600, the word problematical was shortened and problematic was born. Perhaps they wanted to make it less problematic for spellers. It's an adjective that means tough, hard to solve, or even questionable. A flat tire in the middle of the desert would certainly be problematic, as would a star witness with a history of telling lies."
  },
  "oblivious": {
    "short": "If you don't notice or aren't aware, it means that the adjective oblivious applies to you!",
    "long": "When we think of the adjective oblivious, it is usually in situations that involve being totally unaware of what's staring us right in the face. It can also mean being forgetful and absent-minded. The cartoon character Mr. Magoo is a perfect example of someone who is oblivious; his eyesight is so bad that he always gets himself into various scrapes and mishaps. For example, Mr. Magoo mistakes an airplane for a theater and instead of watching a movie, he takes a seat on a departing airplane!"
  },
  "aquarium": {
    "short": "Aquarium can either describe a small tank, or an entire building that houses fish and other aquatic life. Your goldfish will probably feel right at home in the aquarium that's sitting on your desk, but a whale would be better off in a big aquarium where people buy tickets to see marine life.",
    "long": "An aquarium can be small enough to fit in the average house, or big enough to house whales and accommodate millions of tourists each year. If you're talking about more than one of those tanks filled with fish and other marine life, you could say aquariums, but aquaria, from the original Latin term, is also an acceptable plural."
  },
  "tentative": {
    "short": "Choose the adjective tentative to describe something you are unsure or hesitant about. On Monday, you can make tentative plans for the weekend, but it's too early to commit to one party or another.",
    "long": "Tentative, from the Latin tentātīvus, \"testing, trying,\" always describes something that is uncertain. If you make a tentative appointment, write it down in pencil, not pen, because it might have to be changed. Here the opposite of tentative is definite or set. If someone gives you a tentative smile or nod, the person feels hesitant or unsure about something. In this case, its opposite is confident."
  },
  "dexterous": {
    "short": "If you're dexterous, you're good with your hands. To be dexterous is an essential trait for knitters and sleight-of-hand magicians.",
    "long": "The adjective dexterous often refers to skill and agility with the hands, but it can mean any skillful or clever physical movement. A kid's dexterous ball handling and footwork can aid him on the soccer field. Dexterous can also be used to describe mental skill and agility — like the dexterous handling of an uncomfortable situation at work."
  },
  "welter": {
    "short": "Use the noun welter to describe an enormous, messy pile, like the jumble of papers, coffee mugs, pens, and food wrappers on the desk of the messiest person in the office.",
    "long": "Welter can also be a verb — the items in the pile on the messy desk welter every time someone tries to pull something out. This means they roll and get tossed around. Maybe the person isn't as messy as you think. Possibly his projects keep him so weltered — meaning \"deeply involved\" — that he doesn't have the time or energy to deal with the mess."
  },
  "obscure": {
    "short": "If something is obscure, it's vague and hard to see. Be careful if you're driving in heavy rain — the painted lines can be obscure.",
    "long": "Obscure comes from Latin obscurus, which can mean \"dark, dim,\" \"unclear, hard to understand,\" or \"insignificant, humble.\" We tend to use obscure in the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and probably insignificant. Obscure can also be used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a debate, your embarrassing twitches and shaking hands can obscure your argument."
  },
  "impetuous": {
    "short": "Someone impetuous acts too hastily or carelessly. Hotheaded, impulsive folks are impetuous.",
    "long": "If you're a careful person who thinks everything through and doesn't act rashly, then you're not very impetuous. Impetuous has to do with doing things on the spur of the moment — and not good things. Being impetuous usually goes along with being impatient and easily angered. If you're impetuous, you act quickly and thoughtlessly when you should just take a deep breath, relax, and think about the best thing to do."
  },
  "condone": {
    "short": "If you condone something, you allow it, approve of it, or at least can live with it. Some teachers condone chewing gum, and some don't.",
    "long": "Things that are condoned are allowed, even if everyone isn't exactly thrilled about it. People often say, \"I don't condone what he did, but I understand it.\" Condoning is like excusing something. People seem to talk more about things they don't condone than things they do condone. Your mom might say, \"I don't condone you staying up till 10, but I know you need to read.\" That's a way of giving approval and not giving approval at the same time."
  },
  "impartial": {
    "short": "If you're in a contest, you'd better hope the judges are impartial. That means that they aren't biased toward one competitor over another.",
    "long": "If you’re partial to the color green, you love green and wear it all the time. If you’re impartial to colors, you don’t care what color you wear. To be impartial is to be objective, so you don’t mind one way or another how something is going to turn out. It’s important for jurors to be impartial when reaching a verdict, rather than allowing biases and preconceptions affect their judgment."
  },
  "resist": {
    "short": "To resist something is to keep it at bay or to fend off its influence or advance. You might not be able to resist the temptation to sneak out to the dance in spite of your parents' objections.",
    "long": "The verb resist comes from the Latin word resistere, meaning “to take a stand,” or “withstand.” People who are able to put up a wall — be it mental, physical, philosophical, emotional, or otherwise — to defend themselves or their group against a threat can be said to resist. The Amish community is still able to resist the influence of technology. Many a child will resist the suggestion to use a napkin. You might resist a second helping of pie."
  },
  "obliterate": {
    "short": "When you see obliterate, think of evil alien invaders that zap a planet with a destructive ray. In one blast, the planet and all of the people on it are vaporized. The planet is truly obliterated, or completely wiped out.",
    "long": "A long time ago, obliterate had to do with blotting out words on a page. This is why you see the word literate in there. Today it means to erase or destroy completely so that there is nothing left. While you can still obliterate text, you can also obliterate hope, an opponent, or all traces of your presence. Whatever you obliterate is completely gone."
  },
  "redolent": {
    "short": "When something is redolent of something, it makes you think of that thing by making a pretty strong impression on you. He had a shifty eye redolent of years of lying and petty crime.",
    "long": "People used to use redolent of something with a strong, distinctive odor. Now, think of it as \"stinks of\" — but in a fancy way. If you're touring an old castle, you might say that the worn carpet and handsome woodwork are redolent of the place's former glory, though otherwise it's a dump."

  "mace": {
    "short": "You might see the leader of a royal procession carrying a mace, or ceremonial staff. The word mace can also refer to two very different weapons: a long stick with spikes on the end or a chemical irritant that you spray in someone's eyes. Ouch!",
    "long": "Ever see a film about medieval knights battling one another? The spiked weapon that some knights used was called a mace — and it could put quite a dent in your skull. Because we’re all much more civilized now, we don’t use iron maces anymore, but police officers and riot police do use a chemical spray called Mace, which has much the same effect. It was invented in 1968, just in time to deal with pesky student agitators and the like. Get that in your eyes and it’ll ruin your day."

    "long": "If you embody someone, you put him or her \"in-body,\" as when an actor gives a complete and compelling representation of a character. You can also use embody to describe character traits you see in a person, like, “He embodies truth,” or, “She is the embodiment of goodness.”"
  },
  "consternation": {
    "short": "Consternation is a noun that can stop you in your tracks because it means \"a sudden, alarming amazement or dread that results in utter confusion; dismay.\"",
    "long": "If you have a sense of consternation you have become afraid, disoriented, or completely befuddled. It comes from the Latin roots con- and -sternare, which means \"spread out.\" Picture all of your thoughts strewn about, nothing makes sense and you might experience a state of consternation. Like the nightmare about the class you forgot to go to in high school and now you have to take the final exam!"
  },
  "browbeat": {
    "short": "To browbeat is to intimidate with language. Picture yourself in a police station. The cops are trying to get you to talk by using tough, even abusive, language. They are browbeating you.",
    "long": "When someone browbeats you, they're giving you a beating with their mouth and their mind. If your parents have to browbeat you into cleaning your room, they nag you, yell at you and they may even make fun of you and your bad cleaning habits. While the word brow means forehead, think that they're using their head, or brow, to beat you down. It's a figurative, rather than a literal, beating."
  },
  "accelerate": {
    "short": "Accelerate means to speed up. A car accelerates when you step on the gas. You can accelerate the process of getting a visa if you happen to know someone who works in the consulate.",
    "long": "The fastest Amtrak trains are called the Acela line, a made-up word intended to suggest accelerate and therefore communicate that these trains are fast. If you are standing close to one when it zooms by, you may find yourself having an accelerated heart rate — they move pretty fast!"

  "annual": {
    "short": "When something is annual, it happens once a year. An annual holiday party should be a time for fun, but it also can be a sad yearly reminder of the passage of time.",
    "long": "An annual event happens every year: \"I always forget to take sunglasses to my annual eye exam and am left wearing those horrible disposable shades.\" Annual earnings are made over the course of a year: \"His annual income is on a steady decline.\"  And an annual plant lives for only a year: \"My neighbor Shirley always plants the most garishly bright annuals instead of more subdued perennials.\" Whether it's eye exams, income, or plants, you can expect to see something annual again in about 365 days."
  },
  "halcyon": {
    "short": "An old man watching his grandchildren play might look back fondly on his halcyon days, remembering the peaceful, happy time of his youth.",
    "long": "The word halcyon comes from a story in Greek mythology about the halcyon bird, which had the power to calm the rough ocean waves every December so she could nest. Like those calm waters, halcyon has come to mean a sense of peace or tranquility. People often use the phrase halcyon days to refer idyllically to a calmer, more peaceful time in their past."
  },
  "anonymity": {
    "short": "If you want a little bit of invisibility, you might seek anonymity, or being anonymous and nameless. He was a very wealthy man, and he gave most of his money away with quiet anonymity, so no one knew who was helping.",
    "long": "The noun anonymity comes from a Greek word meaning \"without a name.\" If you have anonymity, you have namelessness, and people will not know who you are. Some words that are the opposite of anonymity are \"celebrity\" and \"fame.\" Sometimes people request anonymity, as in \"he phoned the police to report the break-in across the street but requested anonymity so the burglars wouldn't know who turned them in.\""
  },
  "privy": {
    "short": "If you're privy to something, you've been let in on a secret or know about something that most people don't. Not many people are privy to what those top secret documents are all about, for example.",
    "long": "The adjective privy comes from the Latin privatus, meaning “private,” and describes someone who has knowledge of secret or confidential information. But watch out: If you use privy as a noun, it can mean “outhouse” or “toilet,” which actually might be a good place to hide your diary if you don't want anyone else to be privy to its contents."

  "enamored": {
    "short": "The rock star wasn't enamored, or in love, with the idea of performing old-fashioned ballads, until his agent told him there'd be no big paycheck until he started crooning out those romantic tunes.",
    "long": "Being enamored of something or with someone goes far beyond liking them, and it's even more flowery than love. Enamored means smitten with, or totally infatuated. Someone enamored with another will perhaps even swoon. A man who's in love sends the object of his affection a dozen roses, but if he is enamored with her, he covers her entire front lawn with a blanket of rose petals."

  "reconvene": {
    "short": "When you meet up again, you reconvene. School may be out for the summer, but it will reconvene in the fall.",
    "long": "The verb reconvene is used most often when a club, government body, or business meeting comes together again after a pause or a break of some length. The United States Congress reconvenes after a summer recess, and your book group might reconvene after a month or two. The Latin root is convenire, \"unite, agree, or assemble,\" which in turn comes from com, \"together,\" and venire, \"to come.\""

  "intractable": {
    "short": "Can't manage your stubborn little brother who won't do what anyone says? You could call him intractable, or you could call your mother. Problems are intractable when they can't be solved.",
    "long": "Intractable means not tractable. Helpful, right? No? Let's break it down. In both words you see the word tract. A contract is a written document that explains how a legal situation is to be managed together. When someone is tractable they are able to be managed or handled. When they are intractable, they are as unmanageable as a hungry two-year old."

  "permeate": {
    "short": "When you live in a big city like New York, you know all too well how the smells of spices and cooking meats can permeate a hallway, easily passing through those thin apartment doors to make your mouth water.",
    "long": "The verb permeate literally means to \"pass through.\" It's often used to describe smells or liquids that not only pass through, but also spread to fill an entire area. When you bake cookies, you'll notice that the rich, sweet smell of those cookies isn't confined just to your oven — it permeates the entire kitchen and even the whole house. In science class, you might have learned about a permeable membrane — a thin material that is porous enough to let liquids or gases to pass through."

  "feign": {
    "short": "For a more formal way to say pretend to or imitate, choose the verb feign. You might feign indifference when you hear about some gossip, but you're probably dying to know.",
    "long": "Feign comes from the Latin fingere \"to devise, fabricate.\" The word fiction comes from the same source, so if you feign something such as sleep, you give off the fiction that you are sleeping. This can be done to be polite but also to deceive such as when you feign an injury or the flu so you can stay home from school or work. You can also feign an accent, though some are better at this than others."
  },
  "reproach": {
    "short": "Reproach means to mildly criticize. If you show poor manners at your grandmother's dinner table, she will reproach you.",
    "long": "The verb reproach means to express disapproval or criticism of; as a noun it means blame or criticism. If you are beyond reproach that means no one could find anything to criticize about you. Synonyms for reproach are the verbs admonish, reprove, rebuke, reprimand. As a noun, reproach can also be shame. If you are caught lying, it is a reproach that might bother you for a while."
  },
  "zenith": {
    "short": "Zenith means the high point — it comes from astronomy, where it describes the highest point in an arc traveled by a star or a planet or another celestial body. The sun reaches its zenith when it is as high in the sky as it is going to go on that day.",
    "long": "Zenith — and its opposite, nadir — have been appropriated by non-astronomers and are used to describe high and low points in non-astronomical contexts. For example, you can say that the high school quarterback hit his zenith in high school, and it was all downhill from there. Do yourself a favor and try to delay your zenith so you'll have something to look forward to in your future!"

  "nonconformist": {
    "short": "A nonconformist is someone who doesn’t conform to other people’s ideas of how things should be. Activists, artists, street performers, your wacky uncle Marvin — anyone who marches to the beat of a different drummer is a nonconformist.",
    "long": "Nonconformist is one of those words that has both a noun and an adjective form. The noun describes someone who acts apart from the masses, and the adjective describes people or other things that have those same nonconformist qualities. If your actions mark you as a nonconformist, chances are you'll take a nonconformist approach when it comes to planning your next vacation."

  "fragment": {
    "short": "A fragment is a small piece that’s come off a larger whole, and to fragment is to break. If your teacher writes \"frag\" on your paper, you've got an incomplete sentence.",
    "long": "Fragment, meaning \"a tiny, brittle shard,\" first appeared as a noun and later as a verb. That afternoon you hacked away at the fireplace in your parents’ living room in search of secret treasure as a child? Those dusty chunks of brick you scattered all over their shag carpet were fragments of a once-intact wall, and a happier time before you were grounded. Not only did you cause physical damage that day, but you also fragmented their trust in you."

The beauty of music or nature can be awe-inspiring, but sublime is also useful for describing everything from an impressive serve in tennis to a jaw-droppingly good taste sensation."

  "repeal": {
    "short": "To repeal something — usually a law, ordinance or public policy — is to take it back.  For example, dog lovers might want the town council to repeal the law that says residents can have no more than four dogs.",
    "long": "The verb repeal comes from the Anglo-French word repeler, “to call back.” Repeal is almost always used in the context of law: When a government decides to get rid of an ordinance or law, that ordinance or law is repealed. That means it is no longer in effect, like if the weather becomes unseasonably hot, the schools might repeal the part of the dress code to permit students to wear shorts."
  },
  "forgo": {
    "short": "The verb forgo means to give up or lose the right to something.",
    "long": "The word forgo can be traced back to the Old English word forgān, which meant to pass away or to die, which is sometimes referred to as \"giving up the ghost.\" Perhaps it was this idea of relinquishing something that led to our modern-day use of the word forgo to mean to give up, waive, or forfeit something. For example, someone charged with a crime might decide to forgo the right to remain silent and instead confess."

  "patronize": {
    "short": "If you patronize a business, you shop there regularly. But if someone patronizes you, it's not so pleasant — they talk to you as if you were inferior or not very intelligent.",
    "long": "Patronize comes from Latin patronus \"protector, master,\" related to pater \"father.\" So if you patronize a person, you talk down to them like a father might do to his child or a master to his apprentice. If you want to take an advanced class and your advisor warns you of all the hard work, you can tell him to stop patronizing you — you know a hard class involves hard work. This sounds much better than saying, \"I'm not stupid!\""

  "distill": {
    "short": "When you distill something, you are boiling it down to its essence — its most important part. Whether it's alcohol or ideas, the distilled part is the most powerful.",
    "long": "The original meaning of distill comes from the process of making alcohol, known as distilling, in which all the impurities of a substance are vaporized and its pure, high-alcohol condensation collected. Distill eventually came to mean any process in which the essence of something is revealed. If you take notes at a lecture and then turn them into an essay for your professor, you're distilling your notes into something more pure and exact. At least, that's what you hope you're doing."

    "long": "Interrogate comes from the Latin prefix inter-, “between” added to the Latin verb rogare, “to ask.” To interrogate someone is not just asking a few polite questions over a cup of tea. When you interrogate someone there is usually a method to the questioning with a specific mission in mind, like determining a criminal's motive or where she stashed the loot. Your college entrance interview may feel like an interrogation, but their mission is really just to get to know you."

A mosaic is a style of art where a larger image is created by arranging bits of clay, glass, or other materials in a pattern.

Rough seas are choppy and turbulent, and might make you seasick. On a rough day, lots of things go wrong. A rough person (who could be called \"a rough\") tends to get into fights.

    "long": "When your habits or views have solidified into inflexible patterns — especially if those views are conservative — you can describe yourself as ossified. It's not a compliment to call someone ossified, since it implies an inability to change or bend or even to consider another person's viewpoint.

    "long": "In the late 17th century, during a conflict in Jena, Germany, between townspeople and students, someone referred to the townspeople as “Philistines.” Since then, philistine has described someone who stands against learning and the arts. And if you don’t start reading the great Russian authors, someone might suggest that you have a philistine attitude toward literature — the word can also be used as an adjective describing a person or thing that displays indifference to the arts and intellectual pursuits."

  "wardrobe": {
    "short": "All of the clothes in your closet make up your wardrobe. If you're tired of your wardrobe,  it just might be time to go shopping.",
    "long": "From the words warder, meaning “to protect”, and robe, meaning a “piece of clothing,” wardrobe originally meant an entire room where a person's clothing was stored. Nowadays, most people don’t have an entire room for their clothes, so the word wardrobe has downsized to just a large cabinet, or the clothing itself.

    "long": "In literature, a travesty is a work that humorously and crudely imitates another work or style. But you can also use this word to describe anything that seems to mock, distort, or poorly imitate something else. A travesty of justice, for example, is a court case that makes a mockery of the judicial system — or so you might think, if the verdict isn't in your favor. Travesty comes from the French travesti, meaning \"dressed in disguise.\""

  "dumbfound": {
    "short": "The verb dumbfound means to puzzle, mystify, or amaze. If people never expected you to amount to much in high school, but you grew up to be a rocket scientist, you will surely dumbfound your former classmates at your next reunion.",
    "long": "The word dumbfound is a combination of the words dumb and confound. Dumb, in the original sense, means unable to speak. Confound is from the Latin word confundere, which means to mix together as well as to confuse. Thus the blended word dumbfound has the sense of to confuse to the point of speechlessness. If you see a solar eclipse for the first time, it might dumbfound you."
  },
  "morbid": {
    "short": "If the first section of the newspaper you read is the obituaries, you could be considered morbid. Morbid is a word used to describe anyone who spends too much time thinking about death or disease.",
    "long": "A lot of English words relating to medicine and science come from Latin, and the adjective morbid is one of them; it comes from the root morbidus, meaning \"diseased\" or \"sick.\" Morbid can also be used to describe other nouns besides people. If you wear Goth clothing, your wardrobe might be described as morbid. And if you hang tombstones on your walls, your taste in art could also be described as morbid."
  },
  "extirpate": {
    "short": "The verb extirpate originally meant \"to weed out by the roots.\" Now you can use it more broadly to describe getting rid of something completely.",
    "long": "Use the verb extirpate when you mean to destroy completely or get rid of completely. If you came home from vacation with your luggage infested by bedbugs, you will need to call an exterminator to extirpate them. The dodo bird was extirpated due to hunting and the introduction of predators in their habitat."
  },
  "natal": {
    "short": "Use the adjective natal to describe something that has to do with birth, like an adopted child's natal family, or birth parents.",
    "long": "The word natal shows up a lot when doctors talk about birth and pregnancy, especially in \"prenatal,\" which describes what happens before a baby is born. You can also use natal for things that occur at the same time as a birth, like the position of the stars on that day or the town in which a child is born — her natal city. In the fourteenth century, natal meant \"pertaining to birthdays,\" from the Latin word natus, \"to be born.\""
  },
  "baroque": {
    "short": "Something baroque is overly ornate, like a paisley red velvet jacket with tassels, or music that has a lot going on and might include a harpsichord.",
    "long": "Anything with a complicated design can be baroque but it also refers to a style of art, music, and architecture from 17th Century Italy (and is then sometimes capitalized). Although it has roots in the Portuguese word barroco meaning \"imperfect pearl\" not everything baroque is imperfect. Caravaggio and Rubens are considered baroque painters, and baroque composers include Vivaldi, Bach, and Handel. Although rococo and baroque both describe something over-the-top, sticklers will save baroque for something with heft and use rococo for lighter designs, like that velvet jacket. Historically, Rococo comes after the Baroque period."

  "vigilant": {
    "short": "Use vigilant to describe someone who keeps awake and alert in order to avoid danger or problems. When taking the subway, be vigilant about your wallet — always know where it is, or someone might steal it from you.",
    "long": "Vigilant descends from the Latin vigilare, \"to be awake, watch,\" from vigil, \"awake, alert.\" If you stay awake vigilantly all night, you're keeping watch or keeping a vigil. A vigilante (pronounced vij-uh-LAN-tee) is a person who acts outside the legal system to punish crime."

    "long": "A simple way to remember the meaning of avow is that it sounds and looks a whole lot like \"a vow,\" to which it's closely related. At the end of almost every wedding, the couple takes their vows, in which they avow their commitment to each other. To take a vow is to avow the things that you say in that vow. Be sure that you mean what you say when you avow something, because people will hold you to it. And don't mutter or mumble. That's no way to avow something."

    "short": "If you get a letter stamped confidential, that means you're not supposed to tell anyone else what it says. It's private and you're not supposed to blab about it.",
    "long": "Confidential suggests that you're being let in on a secret — as in Kitchen Confidential, the title of a book by Anthony Bourdain, a famous chef, in which he tells unappetizing stories about the restaurant industry. If you confide in someone, you are trusting him or her with confidential or secret information. Choose your confidants wisely!"
  },
  "mollify": {
    "short": "To mollify is to calm someone down, talk them off the ledge, make amends, maybe even apologize.",
    "long": "Mollify comes from the Latin mollificare to \"make soft,\" and that's still at the heart of the word. When you mollify someone, you smooth things over, even if you're maybe still a little mad: \"I was angry that the guy took my seat, but I was mollified when he offered me one closer to the band.\" Unlike the sharp sounds of antagonize, there are only soft sounds in this word that means to make someone feel soft and cuddly. Although dryer sheets might soften your clothes, they don't mollify them (unless your clothes were really mad at you before)."
  },
  "repulse": {
    "short": "To repulse something is to repel it or drive it back. When you repulse your sister, you disgust her. When you repulse the enemy in battle or someone in conversation, you force them back or make them turn away.",
    "long": "Repulse is related to the word repel, and they mean similar things: to repulse an advance — romantic or warring — is to repel, or fend off, its advance. To repulse someone by being disgusting is to be repellent. You could repulse a person's attempts at conversation if you repulse him by picking your nose. Repulse is now most frequently used in the gross-out sense, but Jane Austin often had her characters repulse each others’ attempts at conversation or civility."
  },
  "deposition": {
    "short": "A deposition is a statement made in court. A deposition can be made outside of court, too — after a crime, a witness might give a deposition. Then that written or recorded deposition can be used as evidence in the courtroom.",
    "long": "The word deposition is often used in a legal context, but a deposition can also be more like a deposit, as in the deposition of sediment on the bottom of a lake. And in the sense of depose, a deposition can refer to getting rid of a person of authority. The deposition of a king is the same thing as a dethronement. Deposition is a busy word, but it’s most often used in court."

  "blatant": {
    "short": "Something blatant is very obvious and offensive. Don't get caught in a blatant lie, because you won't be able to weasel your way out of it.",
    "long": "Blatant acts are done without trying to hide them. This adjective is probably from Latin blaterare \"to chatter, croak\" or Latin blatīre \"to chatter, gossip.\" A near synonym is flagrant."
  },
  "receptive": {
    "short": "To be receptive is to be open to new ideas or change. If you’re responsive to other people’s suggestions and not set in your ways, then you’re not only receptive, but flexible.",
    "long": "The adjective receptive actually comes from a Latin word that means receive. So a receptive person is willing to receive things, especially opposing arguments, constructive criticism, and helpful hints. How receptive you are speaks to your willingness to have an impression made upon you. It can be good to be large and in charge sometimes, but you can also benefit from stepping back and being receptive to what life brings."
  },
  "impassive": {
    "short": "Someone who doesn't seem to react — who is always \"taking a pass\" in the conversation of life can be described as impassive.",
    "long": "Impassive is tricky, as it sounds it should be the opposite of passive. It's not, though. The fact is you can be passive and impassive at the same time. When a passive person gets passed over for a promotion at work, their face might remain impassive upon hearing the news."
  },
  "acuity": {
    "short": "Acuity has to do with sharpness and smartness. Do you always get top grades in math? Then you have an acuity for numbers.",
    "long": "People often talk about \"mental acuity\" which is a fancy way of saying intelligence, brains, or smartness. There are specific kinds of acuity, too. As people become very old, they tend to lose their acuity in many areas, including their vision, which is one reason very old people don't drive as well. A 40-year-old quarterback isn't going to have the same acuity for seeing receivers and throwing the ball as a 25-year-old quarterback."
  },
  "sordid": {
    "short": "Describe a person's actions as sordid if they are so immoral or unethical that they seem dirty. Think of the worst parts of a bad soap opera!",
    "long": "Sordid comes from the Latin word sordes, \"dirt.\" Something that is filthy or run down such as a neighborhood or someone's living conditions can be called sordid, but it is usually used figuratively to mean immoral or dishonest. If you want to hear the sordid details of someone's actions, it's because they were extremely dishonest or immoral and also because they were supposed to be kept a secret."
  },
  "insularity": {
    "short": "The noun insularity refers to the quality of being isolated or detached. In fact, the word is based on the Latin word insula, for \"island.\" The phrase \"no man is an island\" means that no one can be completely separate from others.",
    "long": "The word insularity has a sense of detachment and insulation, but sometimes the meaning is extended to mean being narrow-minded. Parents always try to protect their kids from harm, but sometimes their insularity goes too far. If you grew up in the 1950s, for example, your parents may have wanted to protect you from the evils of Elvis and rock and roll."
  },
  "spectrum": {
    "short": "A spectrum is a broad range of similar things or qualities, like the wide spectrum of political beliefs in this country, ranging anywhere from super conservative to über-liberal and everything in between.",
    "long": "Our modern definition of spectrum started out in the 1600s, when scientists used it to refer to the band of colors formed by a beam of light, like a rainbow. In physics, it’s a word that describes the distribution of something, like energy or atomic particles. We still use those scientific meanings today, but spectrum can also apply to non-science related groupings or ranges of related things."
  },
  "genealogy": {
    "short": "Your genealogy is the story of your ancestry, sometimes referred to as your family tree. Most Americans can trace their genealogy back to Europe, Africa, and Asia, but that's not a hard and fast rule.",
    "long": "The first clue to the meaning of the word genealogy is in the root \"gene,\" as in \"passed on through the genes.\" Add to that the suffix -logy, which means \"study,\" and you get genealogy, the study of one's origins. While some folks are eager to understand their genealogy, others prefer to forget their family history. But these days, knowing one's genealogy can have real advantages, especially medical: knowing your genetic history can help you maintain your health."
  },
  "inert": {
    "short": "Something that's unable to move or moving without much energy can be described as inert. Wind up in a body cast and you’ll find yourself not only itchy, but totally inert.",
    "long": "When motion is restricted or sluggish, or when something or someone appears lifeless, the adjective to use is inert. A dog who's playing dead is inert, as is a really boring movie. Or for those of you paying attention in chemistry class, you may have heard of inert gases — those elements that won't react with other elements or form chemical compounds."
  },
  "tedium": {
    "short": "Tedium is the state of being really bored while doing something repetitive. You may loathe the tedium of eating dinner with the family — after all, what is more boring than talking to mom and dad, especially if you could be texting friends?",
    "long": "The noun tedium comes from the Latin root word taedere, meaning \"to weary of,\" and that's still what tedium means today: bored and weary of it all. The noun can also mean a tedious period of time — school concerts and assemblies are always two hours of tedium. Tedious is a related adjective form of the word. In order to relieve the tedium of homework, you should pick less tedious tasks, try fencing or painting to add some excitement to the day."
  },
  "handsome": {
    "short": "If your father is described as handsome, it means he is good-looking, attractive in a classically masculine way. If your mother is also called handsome, it means while she's striking, if not exactly pretty.",
    "long": "Handsome is always a compliment, an admiring way of describing someone, although it's sometimes used as a way to describe a woman who's not conventionally attractive but is still interesting-looking. You can use it to describe an object as well as a person, in which case you are most likely talking about something that's really well-made, or of an obviously high quality, like a particularly handsome oak dining-room table. Occasionally, people talk about a handsome amount of money or a handsome number of votes; this is a generally admiring way of describing almost anything."
  },
  "furtive": {
    "short": "If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly or secret, sneak in furtive. Let's hope the teacher doesn't see your furtive attempts to pass notes in class!",
    "long": "The adjective, furtive, is related to fūrtum, the Latin word for theft or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions \"to give someone a furtive glance\" and \"to steal a glance at someone\" mean the same thing. If a person's manner is furtive, he or she is acting suspiciously. Secret, stealthy and sly are all similar in meaning, but they lack this image of a thief's actions."
  },
  "gesticulate": {
    "short": "When you gesticulate, you make sweeping and excited movements with your hands when speaking. Someone describing a scary car accident might gesticulate wildly.",
    "long": "The verb gesticulate is related to the noun gesture. Gesture has stress on the first syllable, and gesticulate has the stress on the second syllable. Gesticulate, which comes from the Latin gesticulus meaning \"to mimic,\" describes animated movements people make in conversation — with and without words. People who gesticulate could be said to talk with their hands!"
  },
  "complicity": {
    "short": "Complicity is involvement in a wrongful act — like when you drove your newly-turned-vegetarian friend to a fast food joint so that she could scarf down a hamburger.",
    "long": "Complicity refers to the act of helping someone else behave inappropriately or illegally. If you find yourself accused of complicity, it's often helpful to show that you were unaware of the other person's intentions. In the case of the trip to the fast food restaurant, that's going to be hard to prove. You'll probably be scorned for being an accomplice, or someone who is complicit, in your friend's shameful act."
  },
  "manifest": {
    "short": "Choose the verb manifest when someone shows something for everyone to notice. You might manifest your dislike of school food by stirring it around into a big pile of slop on your tray.",
    "long": "Coming from the Latin manifestus, \"caught in the act,\" manifest can be used as an adjective or a noun as well as a verb. As an adjective, manifest is a formal way to say that something is apparent to the senses and is synonymous with evident, apparent, or clear. If you have strong feelings about something, they will be manifest on your face. A ship or plane's manifest is the list of cargo or passengers on a particular trip."
  },
  "affinity": {
    "short": "If you get along with someone very well, you have an affinity with them. Sometimes opposites attract, so you might feel a strange affinity to someone who is seemingly very different from you.",
    "long": "When you are attracted to someone or something a great deal, we say that you have an affinity, a natural connection. Likewise, scientists use affinity to describe organisms that are alike or resemble each other. Interestingly, the Middle English word, affinite, originally applied to people who were connected or related by marriage, rather than by biology."
  },
  "propriety": {
    "short": "Propriety is following what is socially acceptable in speech and behavior. Your little brother might offend your sense of propriety by burping loudly at the dinner table.",
    "long": "Propriety is like the noun form of \"proper\" and \"appropriate.\" It comes from the same root as the word property, in the sense of \"a distinctive character or quality.\" The opposite of propriety is impropriety, meaning \"rude or inappropriate.\" If you're someone who is overly concerned with propriety, your friends beg you to loosen up now and then."
  },
  "incendiary": {
    "short": "An incendiary device is a bomb. An incendiary statement is, \"You're ugly and stupid.\" Both are likely to produce an explosion of one kind or another.",
    "long": "Incendiary means more than flammable. It means explosive, in both a literal and figurative way. If you're a radical who changes the world by exciting people and makes as many enemies as followers, you're an incendiary figure. The speeches you give that rile people up are incendiary. The fires you set are also incendiary, and by setting them you are also likely to be called an incendiary — someone who burns things, more commonly known as an arsonist."
  },
  "stymie": {
    "short": "The verb stymie means to obstruct or hinder. Constantly texting with your friends will stymie your effort to finish your homework.",
    "long": "Stymie was first used on the golf course in Scotland, where it referred to an opponent's ball blocking your own ball’s path to the cup. From there a verb sense developed, until finally stymie came to mean blocking with any obstacle, not just a golf ball."
  },
  "vulnerable": {
    "short": "Use the adjective vulnerable to describe something or someone open to being physically or emotionally wounded, like a newborn chick or an overly sensitive teenager.",
    "long": "Vulnerable is from Latin and is based on vulnus, \"wound.\" From its literal meaning, it has come to be more often used for someone who is easily hurt or likely to succumb to temptation. It's best used for a person whose feelings are so delicate that they can't withstand any criticism or pressure: \"Don't speak harshly to her, she's very vulnerable today.\""
  },
  "oratorio": {
    "short": "An oratorio is a musical piece that is usually lengthy and based on some Biblical or religious event. It is a performance for voice and orchestra, but the story is told through the music, and not with scenery, costumes, and action.",
    "long": "In Rome, musical services were presented in the church of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri. An oratory, from the Latin word oratorium, meant \"place of prayer.\" These sorts of musical services spawned the type of music known as oratorios. Handel's Messiah is a well known oratorio that is often performed at Christmas. You are probably familiar with the part that goes \"Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\""
  },
  "antithetical": {
    "short": "Something is antithetical when it is in complete and utter opposition to the character of something. If you’re a vegetarian, eating giant T-bone steaks is antithetical to your beliefs.",
    "long": "You’ll find that antithetical is a useful word when you’re trying to express an extreme contrast. If someone is trying to convince you to do something you don’t believe in, or to allow an organization you’re involved with to adopt measures you are strongly against, you can use antithetical. You go out to vote because sitting out of the voting process is antithetical to what you believe in.  If you find that your club wants to adopt exclusive measures when it is supposed to be open, you'll tell them that that's antithetical to the club's purpose."
  },
  "militate": {
    "short": "Your father's loss of his job may militate against the big family vacation your parents had been planning. To militate is to be a deciding factor for or against.",
    "long": "The word militate descends from the same Latin word as military. Imagine armed soldiers at a check point. Their presence might militate against your plan of crossing the border, or it might militate for their bringing you in for questioning. When you are young, sometimes your age works for you, and sometimes it militates against you."
  },
  "ironic": {
    "short": "If something is ironic it's unexpected, often in an amusing way. If you're the world chess champion, it would be pretty ironic if you lost a match to someone who just learned to play yesterday.",
    "long": "Ironic is the adjective for the noun irony. In contemporary speech, when we call something ironic, we often mean sarcastic. If you spill coffee all over drawings you've been working on all morning, you might ironically tell your coworker, \"I've done something wonderful!\"  An ironic outcome is the opposite of what's intended. Having someone splash mud on you is always annoying, but it would be ironic if they had splashed you because they were running up to wipe dirt off you."
  },
  "obstetrician": {
    "short": "If you were born in the United States, probably the first doctor you ever laid eyes on was an obstetrician, a medical doctor who delivers babies.",
    "long": "In many parts of the world, it’s more likely that a midwife would welcome you into the world. But even though an obstetrician is a medical doctor and can be  male or female, the name goes back to the Latin word for midwife, obstetrix, the woman who \"stands in front [of the woman having the baby].\" Obstetricians are often called “O.B.,” for short, and an O.B. who also treats diseases of the female reproductive system is called an “O.B.-G.Y.N.,” “obstetrician-gynecologist.”"
  },
  "propagate": {
    "short": "To propagate is to be fruitful and multiply, by the usual routes of reproduction, or by spreading something around — like a rumor.",
    "long": "Propagate comes from the Latin word propagare, which means \"to reproduce plants, breed.\" Plants love to propagate, especially when someone with a green thumb starts off with a jade plant stem in water and ends up with a garden full of the succulents. Plants aren't the only things to propagate like bunnies: in some apocalyptic movies, a virus propagates quickly, killing almost everyone in the world. Sound and light can also spread, or propagate, through the air."
  },
  "begrudging": {
    "short": "To begrudge someone for something is to wish them ill for it or to envy them. Try not to begrudge his getting the promotion over you — he's been at the company longer.",
    "long": "An understudy might begrudge the lead her role and even go so far as to put glass in her shoes so she can't perform. An easy way to remember the meaning of this verb is to note the noun grudge lurking inside it. A grudge is ill will that you hold toward someone: to begrudge is to hold that grudge. If you begrudge your friend his happiness because he got the nicer car, your friendship will suffer."
  },
  "devolve": {
    "short": "You've probably heard that organisms evolve over time. Well, life is complicated, and sometimes things devolve instead — to devolve is to get worse instead of better.",
    "long": "The de- in devolve is a clue to its meaning. When things devolve, they deteriorate, degenerate, fall apart, go to the dogs, and generally end up worse. When a classroom gets loud and rowdy, a teacher might say the class has devolved. There is another, less negative, meaning of devolve. You can devolve responsibilities: for example, the U.S. government could devolve a certain responsibility to the states. The non-negative meaning of devolve is kind of like passing things on in a will. If I devolve something to you, you inherit it."
  },
  "clan": {
    "short": "A clan is an extended family. Your clan might include your parents and siblings, but also your cousins and second cousins, aunts and uncles, and grandparents.",
    "long": "Families that are related to each other, whether through marriage or as distant cousins, are members of the same clan. If you get together with a big family group every summer, you can say you vacation with your clan. In Scotland, a person's clan has a specific name, like \"clan MacLachlan.\" The word comes from the Gaelic clann, \"family\" or \"offspring,\" with the Latin root planta, \"offshoot.\""
  },
  "livid": {
    "short": "If you're livid, you're furious, in a black cloud of anger. The Latin root this word comes from means \"bluish-gray\" or \"slate-colored,\" and you can also use livid to describe the color, such as a livid bruise or a livid sea.",
    "long": "Livid, even when it means \"bluish-gray,\" has the sense of something not quite right. If the sky is livid, there's something ominous about it. Similarly, if your skin is livid, there's something wrong — you're either covered with bruises or you're at death's door, anemic and ashen. But livid is used most often to describe fury. What if you waited in line 15 hours and the person in front of you got the last seat for the hottest concert of the summer? You'd be livid!"
  },
  "tirade": {
    "short": "A tirade is a speech, usually consisting of a long string of violent, emotionally charged words. Borrow and lose your roommate’s clothes one too many times, and you can bet you’ll be treated to a heated tirade.",
    "long": "The noun tirade is related to the Italian word tirata, which means \"volley.\" So imagine a very angry person lobbing harsh words and strings of profanity in your direction when you want to remember what  tirade means. Although, tirades don't necessarily have to include bad words — any long, drawn out speech or epic declaration can be called a tirade."
  },
  "convey": {
    "short": "When you convey something, you carry or deliver it. Little Red Riding Hood conveyed a basket of muffins to her grandmother. Your sad smile might convey more about your feelings than words ever could.",
    "long": "You can also convey a message or information, which means that you communicate it to someone directly or indirectly through your words or actions. In law, the word convey means to transfer or pass property to someone. This verb is from Middle English conveyen, from Old French conveier, ultimately from the Latin prefix com-, \"together,\" plus via, \"way.\""
  },
  "engender": {
    "short": "Engender is a fancy way of saying \"to make happen,\" like when you engender the spirit of teamwork and cooperation by encouraging others and doing your share of the group's work.",
    "long": "The verb engender has nothing to do with being male or female, though originally, it did mean \"beget, procreate.\" Today, engender means \"to produce or bring about.\" When students come to class prepared, meaning they've read their assignment, this engenders better class discussions, just as mutual trust and the desire to help each other engenders a meaningful friendship."
  },
  "restive": {
    "short": "To be restive is to be impatient or on edge — it's an edgy state. When you feel like your skin is too tight and your nerves are ready to snap, when you feel ready to explode, you are restive.",
    "long": "It's not only people who can be restive: the world suffers from much turmoil, and there are restive areas, where people are unhappy or oppressed and desperate for change. It's that need for change and movement that makes someone restive or eager to move, frustrated at being stuck in one place. This sense of being stuck is obvious in the history of the word, which was first used in the 15th century. It evolved from the Anglo-French adjective restif, which meant \"refusing to move ahead.\" Picture a restive horse, refusing to take a jump."
  },
  "plaintive": {
    "short": "Plaintive is an adjective for describing someone or something with a pleading, sorrowful, desperate tone. If you have ever heard the plaintive howl of a wolf, then you know what we are getting at here.",
    "long": "A plaint, as in complaint, is an expression of sorrow or grief. This word has also been bent a little at the ends to become plaintiff or complainant — the sufferer — in a lawsuit. So, whether you are hearing a plaintive tone in a courtroom, at a funeral, or in the wild (as in an animal's plaintive howl), you can be assured that someone or something desires something desperately."
  },
  "sinecure": {
    "short": "If you have a cushy job — one that pays, but involves minimal work — then you have a sinecure. \"Because he was the brother of the CEO, he was offered a sinecure in the company: he showed up each day and collected a paycheck, but others actually did his work.\"",
    "long": "The noun sinecure comes from the Latin root words sine cura meaning \"without care.\" It originally was used to describe a church position that did not include caring for the souls of parishioners, but that meaning is considered archaic now. The word is now usually associated with political appointments."
  },
  "ruminate": {
    "short": "When you ruminate, it means you are thinking very deeply about something. You're likely to be so lost in thought that you stare off into space and don't hear people when they call your name.",
    "long": "Another meaning of ruminate is to \"chew the cud,\" which can mean \"to turn it over and over in your mind.\" Or, if you're a cow, to turn food over and over in your stomachs in order to digest it. Whether you're a human or a cow, if you ruminate, it will take a LONG time."
  },
  "obstinate": {
    "short": "When someone is beyond stubborn, use the word obstinate instead: \"You obstinate old mule! Get out of my way!\"",
    "long": "While stubborn may have positive or negative connotations, obstinate is most definitely negative, because it implies a kind of hard-headed determination not to change your mind even when it might be best to rethink your position. \"The obstinate Man does not hold Opinions, but they hold him,\" wrote Samuel Butler way back in the seventeenth century. The word still does the trick if you want a put-down for someone you think is being a pig-headed fool or a stick in the mud."

  "temporary": {
    "short": "Use the adjective temporary to describe something that is not permanent. \"Oh my goodness! That's a tattoo,\" your mother might shriek. You might tell her not to worry, since it's only temporary, and will wear off in a few days.",
    "long": "The adjective temporary is used to describe something that isn't permanent or lasts only a short time. Its roots are in the Latin word tempus, meaning \"time or season.\" An employee who isn't a permanent addition to the staff is temporary and in this use, the word is often shortened to temp. The lull in the wind and rain is only temporary, because you know you are in the eye of the storm."
  },
  "vociferous": {
    "short": "Vociferous describes loudmouths, such as the vociferous mob at the soccer game.",
    "long": "Vociferous is from the Latin vociferari, meaning \"to shout, yell.\" If you break it down to the first part, take vox, meaning \"voice\" and add it to ferre, meaning \"to carry,\" then vociferous describes voices that carry; you can hear a vociferous person from across the room at a dance party. Vociferous isn't just loud, but annoying, too, like when the vociferous fans of the opposing team chant insults in unison. Try yanking a cookie out of a little kid's hand if you want to hear a vociferous reaction."
  },
  "palliative": {
    "short": "That which is palliative relieves and soothes, but isn’t expected to cure. A heating pack is a commonly employed palliative for temporarily reducing the pain of strained muscles.",
    "long": "From the French palliatif, which in turn came from the Middle Latin palliates, palliative was first recorded as an adjective in the 1540’s, and then later as a noun in 1724. To palliate is to alleviate without curing, so it makes sense that a palliative is the agent for this type of relief. “Life as we find it, is too hard for us: it brings us too many pains, disappointments and impossible tasks,” said the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud. “In order to bear it, we cannot dispense with palliative measures…”"
  },
  "brisk": {
    "short": "Brisk is one of those delightful words that sounds like what it means: quick, lively, bracing, and refreshing. There's nothing like a brisk walk in the morning to get the blood flowing and the spirit ready for the day.",
    "long": "Anything brisk is happening quickly but not too fast. Probably taken from the French brusque, which also means \"quick,\" but in a more negative way, brisk can be used to describe not only physical actions but also more conceptual notions, such as brisk business around the holidays or brisk interactions at a speed-dating event. The soft-drink called Brisk must be called that for a good reason. Perhaps it picks you up!"
  },
  "pervade": {
    "short": "To pervade means to be present throughout, to exist in every part of. If you have too many cats, the horrible smell of cat pee will pervade your house.",
    "long": "You can use pervade both for external things like smells and sickness, and for more internal things like feelings. For instance, you can say that a feeling of doom pervaded the army as they caught sight of the opposition’s superior forces. Despite efforts to prevent bullying, peer pressure and clique mentalities pervade the school environment."
  },
  "banal": {
    "short": "If something is boring and unoriginal, it's banal. Banal things are dull as dishwater.",
    "long": "Ever notice how some TV shows, songs, and even phrases are boring and unoriginal? It's like you've seen or heard the same thing a million times. Anything that's unoriginal and dull is banal — a fancy word for things that bore you to tears. When you're writing, try not to be banal. Clichés and dull topics are banal. New ideas, fresh language, and unusual subject matter can keep your writing from being dreary and banal."
  },
  "sober": {
    "short": "This adjective means the opposite of playful or drunk. When attending a funeral, you are expected to be sober in both senses.",
    "long": "The most common meaning of sober is \"not drunk\" — people who drive need to be sober. Sober sounds a lot like somber, and it often means sad and quiet too, or sometimes too serious. Another meaning is to be logical or realistic about something. Sometimes sober means drab: a grey station wagon is a more sober vehicle than a hot red convertible. All of these meanings are quiet and restrained — unlike a person who has had a lot to drink."
  },
  "belie": {
    "short": "To belie means to contradict. If you are 93 but look like you are 53, then your young looks belie your age.",
    "long": "We get belie from the Old English beleogan, which meant \"to deceive by lying.\" It suggests characteristics or behavior that inadvertently or deliberately hide the truth. To remember it, just think \"be lying.\" Snow White's decision to barge into the Seven Dwarfs' home without invitation belied her gentle nature."
  },
  "germinate": {
    "short": "To germinate is to grow or to develop. When a tiny seedling cracks through a seed casing and sprouts, it has germinated. The term is used for other things too, like when an idea germinates into a film or book.",
    "long": "Sometimes you want things to germinate, like the heirloom tomato seeds in your backyard garden. Sometimes what germinates is not desirable — like how joblessness, economic problems, and generations of anti-Semitism provided a fertile ground for Nazism to germinate in pre-war Germany. The word's roots are in botany, but it has grown, or dare we say germinated, to be used for any time something grows and develops."
  },
  "irate": {
    "short": "On the anger scale, first comes annoyed, then vexed, then irate. When cartoon characters are irate, they're so mad that smoke comes out of their ears.",
    "long": "The first syllable of irate is ir for ire, related to the Greek word oistros which means \"thing causing madness.\" An irate investor might sell all his or her stock in a company. Let's hope you thanked your aunt for the birthday check — otherwise you might get an irate phone call from her. When your mother is irate, you'd best get out of the way, and get busy cleaning your room."
  },
  "foolhardy": {
    "short": "If you decide you are going to scale Mt. Everest next weekend without any training or experience, that would be a foolhardy decision. Use the adjective foolhardy to describe someone who rushes into action without considering the consequences.",
    "long": "Foolhardy is a combination of the noun fool and the adjective hardy, meaning \"brave\" or \"bold.\" Put them together and you’ve got “foolishly brave.” Someone who is foolhardy throws caution to the wind and takes reckless chances. A foolhardy mistake is typically the result of this kind of impulsive behavior. But foolhardy doesn’t always imply foolishness or stupidity; foolhardy can convey courage and romance, as in the case of a foolhardy passion or desire."
  },
  "rein": {
    "short": "Rein is both a noun and a verb for guiding and restraining. You can use the long strap, or rein, on a horse to control its speed and direction, and you can rein in your own tongue by closing your mouth.",
    "long": "Rein rhymes with rain but the two words describe very different things. Rain comes down all over the place, uncontrolled, while a rein holds things in place or controls what comes out. As a noun, rein is often used as a plural word \"reins\" when talking about actual leather restraints used in horse riding, but a rein also is something non-physical like when you put a rein on spending by shopping less."
  },
  "misconstrue": {
    "short": "To misconstrue is to get the wrong idea about something. If you misconstrue a friend’s silence, you might get mad at him for ignoring you — until you find out he has a sore throat and can’t talk.",
    "long": "The verb misconstrue comes from mis- meaning \"wrong\" and construe meaning \"construction.\" Combined they mean \"to put a wrong construction on\" — in other words, to interpret in the wrong way. Sometimes people can intentionally allow others to misconstrue something for personal gain. For example, a politician may let voters misconstrue her voting record if she believes doing so will help her get elected."
  },
  "apprehension": {
    "short": "Apprehension is fear or anxiety about something, like the apprehension you feel about an upcoming test. Apprehension is also the capture of a criminal — that is, when the criminal is apprehended. Finally, apprehension can mean one's understanding of an idea.  Get it?",
    "long": "Given the crook's record of evading arrest, the chief had real apprehensions about being able to catch him. Eventually though, she activated the whole police force in an effort to ensure the crook's apprehension. And it paid off! They caught him red-handed. But it wasn't until he saw the video of the crime in progress that the guy apprehended just how much trouble he was in. It was that apprehension that led him to make a deal with the district attorney."
  },
  "meager": {
    "short": "Meager means small and often applies to portions. Your mother may only allow you a meager serving of chocolate cake, and you may need to eat a meager serving of veggies in order to deserve that dessert.",
    "long": "Meager doesn't mean adequate — it means not enough. People with a limited supply of food may try to subsist on meager portions. People who make a meager amount of money probably have a hard time making rent. Meager and emaciated both derive from the Old French maigre. If you can remember that you will look emaciated if your diet is meager, you’ll use the word correctly."
  },
  "provincial": {
    "short": "A provincial person comes from the backwaters. Someone from a small province outside of Provence, France, might seem a little more provincial and less worldly than someone from, say, Paris.",
    "long": "Something or someone provincial belongs to a province, or region outside of the city. Provincial has a straightforward meaning when describing where someone is from, but it has some other shades of meaning too. Something provincial can be quaint and in a pleasing rural or country style, but it also can imply someone less sophisticated, as in someone with provincial, or simple, tastes. Individuals or groups of people who are considered narrow-minded are often labeled provincial, even if they're from the city."
  },
  "fatalist": {
    "short": "A fatalist is someone who feels that no matter what he or she does, the outcome will be the same because it's predetermined. Fatalists share a sense of being powerless to change the world.",
    "long": "In philosophy, a fatalist is someone who holds specific beliefs about life, destiny, and the future. Fatalists share the certainty that fate has already been laid out in front of them, and that they have no real control over what will happen. Sometimes fatalists have a flat or unemotional reaction even to frightening circumstances because of these beliefs. The Latin root is fatalis, \"ordained by fate or destined.\""
  },
  "contiguous": {
    "short": "Use the adjective contiguous when you want to describe one thing touching another thing, or next to it but not actually touching.",
    "long": "Things that are contiguous are near or next to but not actually touching and yet they are also defined as \"touching, sharing a border.\" You can use this adjective to describe people or things related to and nearby others. It comes from the Latin word contiguus, which means pretty much the same thing, \"bordering upon.\" Because the word has two meanings that are very similar but not always the same it can be a bit confusing. This is an example of what's called \"semantic ambiguity,\" when something can mean more than one thing or a word or phrase is not precise."
  },
  "desuetude": {
    "short": "Use the noun desuetude to say that something is not active or not being used, like the desuetude of a neglected park, with its overgrown ballfields and broken playground equipment.",
    "long": "There are two ways to correctly pronounce desuetude: \"DES-wuh-tude\" or \"de-SUE-uh-tude.\" It comes from Latin: de- means \"away, from\" and suescere means \"become accustomed.\" So if people or things are not used — out of custom — desuetude is the result, carrying with it a sense of neglect, disrepair, and inaction."
  },
  "sedition": {
    "short": "Sedition is the illegal act of inciting people to resist or rebel against the government in power. It's what the southern states did at the start of the Civil War.",
    "long": "Sedition is the rebellious talk and encouragement that might lead to a mutiny, and can be charged as a crime, like treason. The Alien and Sedition Acts passed into law in the late 1700s were challenged by none other than Thomas Jefferson as a violation of Americans' First Amendment rights to free speech. The Sedition Act quietly expired a few years later but was essentially replaced in the early 1900s by what is called the Espionage Act, which was later repealed as well. Proving sedition can become a murky business: when should the expression of one's activism be considered free speech and when should it be considered sedition?"
  },
  "culinary": {
    "short": "Culinary means having to do with cooking or the kitchen. If you go to culinary school, you're learning how to cook, most likely because you want to work as a chef.",
    "long": "If you have a culinary streak, you might love cooking for your friends or maybe just watching cooking shows on TV. If your culinary repertoire includes nothing beyond tuna sandwiches and mac-and-cheese out of the box, you have a lot to learn, culinarily speaking!"
  },
  "cosmos": {
    "short": "The cosmos is the sum total of everything — pretty big. It's hard to wrap your mind around the cosmos, as it extends far beyond the Milky Way, or far-off galaxies, or even our own universe.",
    "long": "Cosmos is originally a Greek word, meaning both \"order\" and \"world,\" because the ancient Greeks thought that the world was perfectly harmonious and impeccably put in order. We now use cosmos without the idea of perfect order. Now it means, \"all of creation,\" and particularly on the scale of the stars, the planets, the black holes, the other universes, and all the stuff we don't know about. It's also, totally separately, the name of a pretty, flowering Mexican herb."
  },
  "descry": {
    "short": "If you spot something, you descry it. When you spy it, you descry it. It's a good verb to use when you catch a glimpse of a rare bird in the trees. Or when you finally spot Waldo in a \"Where's Waldo?\" book.",
    "long": "Descry is very similar to \"see\" or \"discern,\" but involves more than just keeping your eyes open. Usually you descry something after observing carefully for a while. Wrote Ovid, the Ancient Roman poet and author: “Time on time revolving we descry, so moments flit, so moments fly.” Apparently, even in antiquity people complained about seeing the time go by too quickly."
  },
  "insipid": {
    "short": "Something insipid is lacking in flavor or interest. You'll probably find the generic poems inside of greeting cards insipid.",
    "long": "Insipid comes from the Latin insipidus, the opposite of sapidus which means flavorful. Because spices and salts are left out, hospital food is usually considered insipid. The most common use of the word is in a metaphorical sense for dull or flat. You might think that your goody-two-shoes cousin is the most insipid girl you've ever met."
  },
  "detestable": {
    "short": "Anything that's so hateful or disgusting that you can't bear to think about it is detestable. Many little kids find all green vegetables to be utterly detestable.",
    "long": "It's pretty common for people to find hate speech detestable, as well as stepping on slugs in bare feet and the pungent smell of garbage. The verb detest means \"hate\" or \"strongly dislike,\" and the adjective detestable brings in an element of disgust or offensiveness. The Latin root, detestabilis, means \"abominable,\" from detestari, \"curse or express abhorrence for.\""
  },
  "beneficent": {
    "short": "Beneficent is the type of act that helps others. If you're a beneficent person, you probably spend a lot of your time volunteering at soup kitchens or homeless shelters, helping people who are less fortunate than you are.",
    "long": "Beneficent shares the same root and sentiment with its fellow adjective, benevolent, which also means something that is good. The two words are so closely related that they also share the same Latin origin. Another related word, benefactor, is someone who gives support to an organization or institution or someone who takes care of another person. Kind, generous, and giving are all synonyms of beneficent."
  },
  "iconoclast": {
    "short": "Are you always challenging the establishment? Or provoking popular thought by attacking traditions and institutions? Then you're definitely an iconoclast.",
    "long": "To be called an iconoclast today is usually kind of cool — they're rugged individualists, bold thinkers who don't give a hoot what tradition calls for. But back in medieval Greece, the iconoclasts had a more thuggish reputation. Stemming from the Greek words eikon, meaning  \"image,\" and klastes, meaning \"breaker,\" an iconoclast was someone who destroyed religious sculptures and paintings."
  },
  "dehumanize": {
    "short": "To dehumanize someone is to make them either feel or appear somehow less than human. Laboring under terrible conditions can dehumanize workers, making them feel more like robots than people.",
    "long": "War can dehumanize people in a few different ways. Violent or seemingly endless fighting might dehumanize soldiers, causing them to stop feeling normal human emotions. War propaganda might dehumanize the enemy, making people more willing to fight against and kill them. At the heart of dehumanize is human, and its Latin root humanus, which means both \"human\" and \"humane, kind, or civilized.\""
  },
  "autocracy": {
    "short": "An autocracy is a government controlled by one person with absolute power. As unlimited power doesn't usually bring out the best in people, autocracies are often brutal regimes.",
    "long": "The word autocracy comes from the Greek roots auto (\"self\") and kratos (\"power\"). If your boss dictates your every move and leaves you no say at all in how you do your work, then you're not in a democratic workplace, you're in an autocracy."
  },
  "capacious": {
    "short": "When something is really big and holds a lot it is capacious, like a capacious purse that is so big, people mistake it for a piece of luggage.",
    "long": "Have you ever seen a Fourth of July hot dog eating contest? As you watch people wolf down 60 or more hot dogs in a matter of minutes, you must be thinking, \"Where do they put all that food?\" Well, it helps to have a capacious stomach. The suffix -ous adds \"full of\" to capacity; capacious is literally \"full of capacity.\"  If something is capacious, it has plenty of extra room."
  },
  "agile": {
    "short": "On water skis she was agile and made sharp turns and long arcs cutting through the water, but she was a lot less agile on the snowboard, landing on her face and hands as she clunked down the slopes.",
    "long": "People and things can be agile, or quick and graceful. Car commercials talk of \"agile handling,\" and nature-shows feature spry creatures who survive by being agile among more slow-footed and clumsy animals. Human and virtual minds also earn the description agile when they're sharp and grasp ideas or reason with speed and easy logic. Things that are agile often are thought to be light, but even heavy machines like trains and large people like sumo wrestlers can be agile."
  },
  "facetious": {
    "short": "Don’t take a facetious comment seriously because it’s supposed to be funny. Anything facetious is a joke. If you've just won a hotdog-eating contest and someone asks if you'd like to go out for burgers, they’re probably being facetious.",
    "long": "If you forget how to spell facetious, notice that it has all five vowels in a row. The word facetious comes from the French facétie, “joke,” and it has come to describe a joke with a little drop of sarcasm. It used to simply mean “funny and witty,” but now it often implies that someone is being inappropriately funny about a serious topic."
  },
  "connote": {
    "short": "Often your body language can connote or imply how you feel without you having to saying it directly. For example, if you fold your arms and look away from someone as he speaks to you, you are connoting your discomfort.",
    "long": "When you act a certain way to show how you feel rather than just outright saying it, you're connoting or suggesting that emotion. Words can often connote or suggest certain meanings or ideas.  The word turbulent connotes the image of a bumpy ride on an airplane, for example. Connote is also used in formal logic. If A connotes B, then for A to be true, B has to also be true."
  },
  "ungainly": {
    "short": "Ungainly is the opposite of graceful, convenient, or easy. A clumsy dancer boogies in an ungainly or awkward fashion.",
    "long": "Though you see gain in ungainly, the word does not have to do with growing, or getting ahead. Ungainly comes from an Old Norse word meaning \"not convenient\" or \"awkward.\" If you want to impress your gym teacher or sports coach, first appear ungainly and then surprise her with your great athletic ability. Applying to college can be an ungainly process without an advisor to help."
  },
  "licentious": {
    "short": "Someone who is licentious behaves or speaks inappropriately, usually in regards to sex.",
    "long": "What some might call a licentious senior citizen, others would simply refer to as \"a dirty old man\" (or woman). We usually talk about licentious behavior, but there also can be licentious photographs. Besides being inappropriate, licentious behavior is also usually regarded as immoral. If at all possible, therefore, licentious is a description you should seek to avoid for yourself."
  },
  "bleak": {
    "short": "Something that is bleak is gloomy and depressing. If it's raining and dark, you might describe the night as bleak. If you have looked for work and no one will hire you, you could describe your prospects as bleak.",
    "long": "If you and the ten people sharing your lifeboat have been adrift for ten days and are down to your last cracker, your situation is bleak. A near synonym is dismal. Bleak is from Middle English bleik, from Old Norse bleikr \"white, pale.\" This word is related to the English word bleach."
  },
  "pare": {
    "short": "To pare is to trim — like when you pare branches on a tree or pare down your expenses to save money.",
    "long": "Pare comes from the Latin word parare, meaning \"to prepare.\"  Think of peeling potatoes, which you might do with a paring knife, or paring your nails so you'll make a neat appearance. In each case, you are trimming something gradually. If you pare down your expectations, you might be pleasantly surprised."
  },
  "besiege": {
    "short": "To besiege means to attack with an army, or to pester with many requests. When all your teachers ask you to hand in assignments on the same day, you can end up feeling besieged.",
    "long": "The source of the word besiege in its military sense is the Latin word for \"seat.\" When an army settles down in front of a fort or other site of attack, they are besieging it or taking a seat there. Picture them continually bombarding the fortress with arrows and cannon shot, and you've got the picture of the figurative sense of the word, \"to pester with requests, etc.\" If you get a lot of spam in your e-mail, you are besieged with advertisements — and maybe also besieged with worries that you'll get a virus!"
  },
  "supplicate": {
    "short": "If you don’t get the grade you were hoping for on your paper, you could try to rewrite it, or you could meet with your teacher and supplicate. Your humble requests for an ‘A’ may or may not work.",
    "long": "This verb is derived from the Latin supplicare, “to kneel.” People often supplicate to God for help in the form of prayer, or supplicate to a judge for a lesser sentence. It is usually an earnest petition made to an authority figure and can be perfectly respectable or can be somewhat pitiful, like begging."

  "candle": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "cogitation": {
    "short": "Cogitation is meditation or deep thinking. Big decisions should be made after cogitation. If people bug you while you’re thinking, impress them by telling them to wait until you’re done with your cogitation. When you’re done, you might shout, “Eureka!”",
    "long": "This word — like the similar cognitive — has to do with thinking. Cogitation is an example of thinking, especially deep thinking. If someone is trying hard to remember something, they are deep in cogitation. Most people find cogitation easier in a quiet place, like a library. Engaging in cogitation is the opposite of acting rashly without thinking. If you like to ponder or mull things over, you enjoy cogitation. Cogitation means something similar to reflection and consideration."
  },
  "stench": {
    "short": "When you pass a dump, you might hold your nose and say, \"Oh, I can't handle the stench.\" A stench is a bad smell.",
    "long": "Stench can also be used metaphorically. If it is discovered that many members of a police force have been taking money from mob bosses so that they can continue their life of crime, a new chief may be brought in to remove the stench of corruption from the office. In either sense, stench is the kind of smell that takes work to get rid of."
  },
  "disingenuous": {
    "short": "Use the adjective disingenuous to describe behavior that's not totally honest or sincere. It's disingenuous when people pretend to know less about something than they really do.",
    "long": "Disingenuous combines dis-, meaning \"not,\" with ingenuous (from the Latin gen-, meaning \"born\") which was originally used to distinguish free-born Romans from slaves, and later came to mean honest or straightforward. So disingenuous means dishonest. Ingenuous is less common now than disingenuous, but we still use it for someone who is sincere to the point of naiveté.  A good synonym is insincere."
  },
  "plod": {
    "short": "When you plod, you walk slowly, heavily, and deliberately. You might need to plod through the snow to get to the bus stop on time.",
    "long": "Plod evokes a difficulty in walking — like when you trudge through mud or walk slowly up a steep hill. You might plod home at the end of a long day, or plod through an overgrown field on a hot afternoon. You can also use plod figuratively to mean \"work on something boring or monotonous.\" The origin of plod is unknown, but it may have come from the sound of feet on the ground — the sound you make when you plod."
  },
  "gratification": {
    "short": "Pleasure is gratification, whether it’s given or received.  Everyone has desires, and when those desires get fulfilled, that’s gratification.",
    "long": "You’re reading this sentence to understand the word gratification, and soon you’ll know it back and forth, which will give you a feeling of gratification.  The word comes from the Latin gratificari, meaning “give or do as a favor,” and a deeper root is gratus, which means “pleasing, thankful.”  Doing a favor for someone is a surefire ways to create a sense of gratification, both for them and for yourself, being such a kind, giving person."
  },
  "circumstantial": {
    "short": "Circumstantial is a word that refers to specific details about something: in other words, about circumstances. Circumstantial evidence might implicate someone's guilt, but it certainly doesn't prove them guilty.",
    "long": "The word circumstances refers to the facts of your life: everyone has different circumstances. So the word circumstantial refers to the specific details of some situation. This word is most often heard in the term circumstantial evidence, which you may have heard on a TV crime or trial program. Circumstantial evidence might lead a detective to suspect someone's guilt, but eyewitness testimony may be needed to convince the jury."
  },
  "lax": {
    "short": "Those parents who let their kids eat all their Halloween candy the night of October 31st? Their parenting style might be described as lax. A paperclip chain used as a bike lock? That's an example of lax security.",
    "long": "While contemplating the word lax, you may note that it's the same as the first syllable in laxative. This is not a coincidence: lax entered English as a noun describing a substance taken or administered to relax the bowels. Interestingly, the modern definition of lax is closer to the Latin source word, laxus — an adjective meaning \"loose.\" Now, lax can refer to any phenomenon that is insufficiently stringent or so slack as to be basically ineffectual. For example, \"The entire class performed incredibly well on the test, largely due to the sleepy professor's lax supervision.\""
  },
  "investiture": {
    "short": "Investiture is what happens when a government official, a judge, or a head of state is formally put into office or promoted to a higher rank. The investiture of a king or queen involves an elaborate, lengthy ceremony.",
    "long": "The noun investiture is good for describing the process of naming a judge or a church bishop, for example, to office. Investitures tend to include ritual ceremony and the symbolic transfer of a position from one person to the next. In the U.S., Supreme Court justices are invested with the position — which literally means \"clothed in the official robes of office.\" Both words stem from the Latin investire, \"clothe in\" or \"cover.\""
  },
  "ostracize": {
    "short": "If you banish someone or ignore him, you ostracize him. When the Iranian president claimed that the Holocaust was a hoax, he was ostracized by the international community.",
    "long": "Ostraka is an ancient Greek word for pottery shard.  Thousands of years ago, in the Greek city of Athens, there was a public process where you would write the name of someone you wanted to kick out of town on a broken ceramic fragment.  If enough Athenians wrote the same name, that person was sent away for ten years. This process was called an ostracism."
  },
  "alleviate": {
    "short": "Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to alleviate, or relieve, your pain.",
    "long": "The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis \"light\" and is related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate — both words implying a lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world hunger."
  },
  "innovative": {
    "short": "Something innovative is new and original. If you love to experiment and find new ways to do things, you are an innovative person.",
    "long": "Innovative, like nova, novel, and novice, comes from the Latin novus, which means new. Something innovative renews or alters the way something has been done. You can use innovative to describe the thing or the person that made it. If your English teacher objects to your experimental writing style, tell him, \"I'm an innovative writer making innovative sentences!\" Antonyms are unoriginal and hackneyed."
  },
  "instructive": {
    "short": "Instructive means \"useful and informative.\" Say you're visiting Paris and looking for the Eiffel Tower when a friendly Parisian native helpfully stops to draw you a map. \"Merci,\" you say. \"This map is very instructive.\"",
    "long": "In English, anything that informs or enlightens is instructive, but in the Finnish language there's something called the instructive case, which is a whole separate way of saying \"by the means of.\" An example would be a sentence like \"I traveled here by horse,\" which you would say differently than any other kind of sentence you might utter. You would also be speaking Finnish, so the information would only be instructive to Finns."
  },
  "dearth": {
    "short": "If there is a dearth of something, there is not enough of it. A dearth of cupcakes is unfortunate, but a dearth of nutritious food is a serious problem.",
    "long": "Dearth is an Old English noun formed from the adjective deore, \"precious, costly,\" and the noun-forming suffix -th. Though the relationship of dearth meaning \"lack, insufficient amount\" to the adjective dear is not so obvious, it is still easy to imagine that something precious is probably also in short supply. Dearth is used almost exclusively in the phrase \"a dearth of.\""
  },
  "penury": {
    "short": "Penury means extreme poverty to the point of homelessness and begging in the streets. Economic downturns, job loss, shopping sprees, and weekends at the high rollers' table in Vegas can lead to penury.",
    "long": "Penury comes from the Latin word penuria, which, though it sounds like something contagious, actually means scarcity. It's not a word that turns up often in casual conversation or even on nightly newscasts. You're more apt to spot it in a college textbook or maybe an editorial in The New York Times."
  },
  "audacity": {
    "short": "If you have audacity then you're one daring — and perhaps reckless — character. Running a red light with three previous tickets under your belt certainly shows audacity. And stupidity.",
    "long": "The noun audacity developed from the Latin word audacitas, which means “boldness.\" So someone who shows audacity makes bold moves — and isn't afraid of the consequences. Audacity can be admired or frowned upon, depending how far it's taken and how it rears its head. But as former British Prime Minister and novelist Benjamin Disraeli once said, “Success is the child of audacity.”"
  },
  "atrocity": {
    "short": "Atrocities, acts of outrageous cruelty, are often committed during wars and armed conflicts.",
    "long": "The word atrocity describes both the act of cruelty as well as the sense of cruelty. If you go to visit a poorly run prison, you might be overwhelmed by the atrocity of the place when you see that no one is treated with respect, and torture is rampant. The word atrocity is also often used in the context of warfare and frequently as a plural. There were numerous atrocities on both sides, as the war raged on and the fighters’ capacity for cruelty seemed to increase."
  },
  "aesthete": {
    "short": "Someone who claims to be concerned only with matters of art and beauty is known as an aesthete. Depending on the way he goes about it, he might also be known as a snob.",
    "long": "The Greeks considered an aisthētḗs as \"one who feels.\" It's from this idea of emotional sensitivity that the word aesthete came about in the late 19th Century as a noun for someone who greatly appreciates beauty and the arts.  An aesthete doesn’t have to be wealthy or highly educated. You can be a hotel maid who stops cleaning to absorb a strain of Beethoven and be as much an aesthete as the poet who writes about the splendor of a leaf."
  },
  "portentous": {
    "short": "The black crows slowly circling the front entrance to your office building at 6:00 am may have a portentous quality, meaning it seems like they’re an omen indicating something bad will happen.",
    "long": "Use the adjective portentous to describe something that seems to be a sign related to a future event — generally an ominous sign. Something that is portentous often seems to hint at or warn of a future disaster. For example, in a movie ominous music playing in the background while someone turns a dark corner can have a portentous quality, predicting doom for the hapless character."
  },
  "politics": {
    "short": "Your friend who's obsessed with watching Congressional debates and listening to experts discuss the bills being voted on in the Senate has a keen interest in politics, or the details of governing or managing a state or a country.",
    "long": "While politics usually refers to the government of a city, state, or country — or the relationship between countries — it can also be used to talk about the way people use their positions in a company or organization to gain power or authority. This is often called office politics. Another similar phrase is playing politics, which means doing something in order to become more powerful rather than doing what's right."
  },
  "expiate": {
    "short": "In the fairy tale, the baker must expiate his father’s sins by bringing the witch three ingredients for a magic potion: a cow, a cape and a slipper. Expiate means to make amends or atone for a wrong you or someone else has committed.",
    "long": "After the incident on the hill, a mortified Jill expiated her guilt by buying Jack a brand new crown.  The shiny new crown served as compensation, or expiation, for the broken one. That it cost her so dearly made the expiatory gesture especially meaningful to poor Jack."
  },
  "misapprehension": {
    "short": "When you have a misapprehension, you make a mistake trying to understand something, which leads you to believe something that isn't true. You may have a misapprehension about your brother's motives for being so nice to you this week.",
    "long": "You may have an uncle who is famous for his misapprehension of luck and probability, which must be why he’s lost so much money gambling. He also has a misapprehension of geography, so he thinks he can get from his house in Maryland to your house in New Hampshire in under four hours — by bus! No one ever said your uncle was stupid — he just has a misapprehension of some basic things that the rest of the family gets."
  },
  "primordial": {
    "short": "Primordial, an adjective, describes something that has been around forever, like cockroaches.",
    "long": "Primordial comes from the Latin words primus, meaning \"first\" and ordiri, \"to begin.\" So it is easy to see that this adjective means \"first of all, original.\" When something is primordial, it has existed since the earliest time, like the primordial mud some scientists believe was the source of all life on Earth. Remember that is it a scientific term — don't call your teacher primordial just because she's been teaching at your school since it opened."
  },
  "inauspicious": {
    "short": "Reaching into your hat to pull out a rabbit and instead removing a sock can seem like an inauspicious start to your magic show. Inauspicious describes something that seems unpromising or unlikely to be successful.",
    "long": "If it's unlucky, badly timed, or it seems to point to an unhappy outcome, it's inauspicious. A dark, stormy sky on the day of a wedding can be seen as inauspicious, and so can an awkward job interview. The opposite of inauspicious is auspicious, which means lucky or promising. Both words come from the Latin auspicium, which has to do with predicting the future by observing the flight of birds."
  },
  "estrange": {
    "short": "To estrange people may sound like adding wobbly antennae and an extra eyeball to their faces. Really, estrange means to push apart people who were once close to each other and cause them to be like strangers.",
    "long": "The verb estrange comes from the Old French estranger, \"to treat like a stranger.” Estrange is often used when talking about family members who are no longer in contact with each other. You can also speak about wanting to estrange the neighbor’s dog from your flowerbed or a writer who estranges her readers by using too many big words. If you're looking for a synonym that is less “strange” but more “alien,” try alienate."
  },
  "document": {
    "short": "A document is a piece of paper that contains official information. Don't you wish you had a document saying that the bank owed you $5 million?",
    "long": "Document comes from the Latin verb meaning \"to teach,\" so a document instructs you with the information it contains. Legal documents such as contracts contain instructions on how the people signing it will act. Passports, driver’s licenses and birth certificates are all official documents. As a verb, document means \"to record in detail,\" or \"offer supporting evidence for.\" If you call a company to complain about something, make sure to document your phone calls by noting the date you called, who you spoke to and what was said."
  },
  "malinger": {
    "short": "When you malinger, you pretend to be sick. If you ever claimed to have a stomach ache in order to stay home from school, you know what it means to malinger.",
    "long": "The word malinger comes from the French malingre, which can mean \"ailing or sickly,\" but its exact origin is uncertain. One theory says that mal, or \"wrongly,\" suggests the sick person is just faking. Lying about a stomach ache, holding the thermometer near a light bulb, refusing to get out of bed, moaning — these are classic tactics of those who malinger, or pretend to be too sick to do anything but lie around the house."
  },
  "proclaim": {
    "short": "\"I proclaim the Olympic Games open.\" Every two years with words similar to these, the Olympic games officially begin. To proclaim is to exclaim or declare.",
    "long": "When you proclaim something, you are saying it loud and clear and in public. A doctor can proclaim you healthy after you have recovered from a long illness. The panel of judges may have trouble proclaiming the winner in a very tight race. What you are saying out loud can be called a proclamation. Proclamations were once only made by Kings or other ruling leaders which is why the word proclaim has an official feeling to it."
  },
  "autonomous": {
    "short": "Autonomous describes things that function separately or independently. Once you move out of your parents' house and get your own job, you will be an autonomous member of the family.",
    "long": "This adjective autonomous is often used of countries, regions, or groups that have the right to govern themselves: Vatican City, where the Catholic pope lives, is an autonomous territory located within the city limits of Rome. The corresponding noun is autonomy, referring to the state of existing or functioning independently. Autonomous comes from the Greek roots autos, \"self,\" and nomos, \"law.\""
  },
  "acme": {
    "short": "When something is at the very peak of perfection, reach for this noun from Greek: acme. A brilliant violinist might reach the acme of her career, but eventually she might become unstrung.",
    "long": "This noun referring to the highest point of something might sound comical because it has shown up so often in cartoons as the name of a company, such as the one that makes Wile E. Coyote's contraptions in the old Warner Brothers cartoons. But the word is actually a serious-minded import from Greek. Near synonyms for high points include zenith, summit, pinnacle, apex, and peak, but acme has a special nuance for an ultimate point of perfection."
  },
  "prospect": {
    "short": "A prospect is the possibility that something fabulous will happen. After you graduate top of your class at Harvard, for example, your job prospects look great.",
    "long": "Prospect is from the Latin word  prospectus  which means a \"view or outlook.\" A prospect is still a way of looking ahead and expecting good things. It's like potential in that it's something that might be but isn't yet. There is also the potential for something bad to happen, but prospects usually look good. In the 1800s, when men in floppy brown hats started saying \"There's gold in them there hills!\" the noun became a verb — to prospect is to search for gold. Either way, when you have prospects, you have a golden future."
  },
  "promenade": {
    "short": "Promenade is a fancy word for going out walking. If you like to stroll through town in a leisurely way, then you like to take promenades.",
    "long": "Besides meaning the nice walk you just took, the noun promenade can also mean a special walking place for pedestrians, like a boardwalk. You can also use it as a verb, and go promenading. In Square Dance, promenade is a move where the couples walk around in a circle, and you might be familiar with the promenade at your high school — or did you just call it \"Prom\"?"
  },
  "utilitarian": {
    "short": "The adjective utilitarian describes something that is useful or functional. If you are attracted to a car for its storage space and gas mileage — as opposed to its sparkly tire rims — then chances are you value a car's utilitarian features.",
    "long": "The word utilitarian was coined by the philosopher and judge Jeremy Bentham, who argued that his principle of utility would create the \"greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\" The noun form of utilitarian refers to a person who adheres to this philosophy of usefulness. \"They couldn't agree on the decor for their living room. She wanted whimsy — delicate tables, fragile statues of fairies and unicorns, and cushions on the floor to sit on. He wanted something more utilitarian and useful — comfortable chairs, a giant TV, and sturdy tables to put your feet on.\""
  },
  "conniving": {
    "short": "Someone conniving is calculating, scheming, and shrewd — in other words, sneaky and up to no good.",
    "long": "Do you know anyone who is always trying to get away with things? Do they constantly look for ways to get out of trouble or work? Those kind of people are conniving. This is a word for secretive, shifty behavior. However, being conniving isn't the worst thing in the world — it's negative, but you probably wouldn't say a murderer is conniving. It's usually reserved for con men, shady business moguls, and manipulative social climbers."
  },
  "outstrip": {
    "short": "While outstrip might make you think about undressing, it really means outdoing. If the productivity of your garden outstrips your neighbor's, expect the neighborhood to come calling for fresh vegetables.",
    "long": "If one thing outstrips another, it exceeds it or goes beyond it. When you outstrip someone during a race, you pass them. When one company’s profits outstrip another’s, they make more money. When the productivity  of one nation outstrips the neighboring nation, they will have a bigger Gross National Product."
  },
  "truant": {
    "short": "A truant is a student who is out of school without permission. If you skip school to go shopping with your friends, you are a truant.",
    "long": "A person can be a truant, and behavior can be described as truant too, since it's both a noun and an adjective. Your teacher might call you a truant if you skip school and if you didn't show up at your donut shop job, you would also be a truant donut slinger. In fact, anyone who's unexpectedly absent can be described as truant. The Old French truant describes a beggar, especially one who lives this way by choice."
  },
  "bemused": {
    "short": "If you're bemused, you're muddled or preoccupied. It happens when you're lost in thought, dazed, or overwhelmed (say, on the first day of high school).",
    "long": "Find the word \"muse\" inside  bemused and imagine being under the spell of one of the muses of Greek mythology. You're so inspired to write poetry that you can't keep your mind on work or remember how to get home. Or think Wile E. Coyote, Sylvester, or another cartoon character staggering off with a vague smile after getting hit over the head by a frying pan and you'll grasp the meaning of a bemused expression."
  },
  "digression": {
    "short": "When your essay about French cooking starts describing a childhood trip to Disneyland, it's taken a digression — it's strayed from the main topic.",
    "long": "\"But I digress\" is a phrase often used by people when they realize they're no longer \"on-topic.\" A digression is like a tangent, only digression often describes speech patterns, whereas tangent comes to us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of digression is its relationship to the word progression. A progression is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same direction; a digression, logically enough, is an idea that goes off in another direction."
  },
  "obsidian": {
    "short": "Obsidian is a type of black or dark glass formed from cooling lava. So if you find a shiny, hard, dark piece of glass next time you’re hanging around a volcano, it’s probably a piece of obsidian.",
    "long": "The word obsidian essentially means “stone of Obsius.” So who was Obsius? According to an ancient Roman writer, he was the guy who first found this type of stone in Ethiopia. You’ll find obsidian used as a modifier a lot. Think of an obsidian arrowhead, blade or mirror. Sometimes it is used as a fancy way of describing people’s eyes in romance novels as in, “Her eyes were dark and shining, two obsidian orbs.”"
  },
  "desolate": {
    "short": "If you feel alone, left out, and devastated, you feel desolate. A deserted, empty, depressing place can be desolate too.",
    "long": "If you know the word deserted, you have a clue to the meaning of desolate, a grim word that can describe feelings and places. When a person feels desolate, he feels deserted, lonely, hopeless, and sad. When a location is desolate, there's almost nothing there. Think of a rundown cabin in the middle of nowhere, with no running water and no stores or other people anywhere. That's a desolate setting. Being in a desolate place usually makes people feel desolate."
  },
  "recuperate": {
    "short": "To recuperate is to get something back that you have lost — could be good health, or money lost in a bad investment. When you recuperate, you heal and recover.",
    "long": "Recuperate comes from the Latin word recuperare “to take back,” so when you recuperate you gain something back that was yours before — health or money. Recuperate is usually something people do after an illness. If you break your knee playing rugby in college, you might go home to recuperate. If you don't want to sound fancy, just say you're recovering. It also means to get money back, so you can also try to recuperate your losses by staying in the poker game."
  },
  "secrete": {
    "short": "Secrete is all about secrets. It means both \"to hide\" and \"to release.\" When you squeeze a lemon, it secretes juice. When you stuff your money in a mattress, you secrete it there.",
    "long": "It's easy to remember that secrete's all about secrets when you see the word secret inside secrete. Imagine the first person who squeezed a lemon and secreted the juice. Probably felt like he'd discovered a secret stash of citrus goodness. If he was greedy, maybe he gathered all the lemons he could find and secreted them away in a box so no one else would learn the secret of the juice-secretion."
  },
  "profuse": {
    "short": "Profuse is a word for a lot of something or even way too much — a profuse rainfall is a serious amount of rain.",
    "long": "This word has to do with extravagance or abundance. If you're bleeding profusely, you're bleeding a lot. If you lavish profuse gifts on your pet, you might have too much money on your hands. When you give someone profuse praise, you're probably laying it on a little thick. If you’re a farmer and your crops are profuse, that’s great because you have a lot of crops. Anything profuse is happening in great amounts."
  },
  "proximity": {
    "short": "The word proximity means nearness or closeness. \"Because of the proximity of our desks, I couldn't help but notice him cheating on the exam.\"",
    "long": "Your favorite thing about your neighborhood of attached row houses might be the proximity of your neighbors — they're really close to you. Proximity comes from the Latin proximus, \"nearest,\" which also gives us approximate, \"close to the actual.\" You can use this noun to talk about a physical closeness, or something that's near in time, like the proximity of the months April and May."
  },
  "facile": {
    "short": "If someone does something easily, or shows ease, it is described as facile in a good way, but if someone takes the easy way out and shows a lack of thought or care, it is facile in a bad way.",
    "long": "While it is a lovely sounding French word, facile is both a compliment and an insult depending on how it's used. Something that shows ready skill is facile, such as being facile with text messaging. But if something is too simple and superficial, or shows little care, it can also be called facile. \"Being too cowardly to tell the truth and admit he didn't do it, he used the facile and sarcastic excuse that the dog ate his homework.\""
  },
  "spell": {
    "short": "A spell is a series of words that has magical powers. If you’re under a spell, then what you do is out of your control — your thoughts and actions are dictated by the spell.",
    "long": "Spell can refer to the magic words you say, or it can describe being under the influence of those words. You probably don’t encounter many magic spells in real life, but the word is often used figuratively to describe those times when you feel like a magical power controls your action. Of course, this word can also mean the verb \"to spell\" which refers to reciting the letters in a word, like the competitive spellers in a spelling bee."
  },
  "dissident": {
    "short": "If you are a dissident, you are a person who is rebelling against a government. Dissidents can do their work peacefully or with violence.",
    "long": "Dissident is closely related to the word, dissent, which means objecting. People who are dissidents show their dissent. Catholic priests who advocate allowing women into the priesthood could be called dissidents, as could the Puritans who left England to live in colonial America. As an adjective, a dissident member of a group is one who disagrees with the majority of members."

  "archetype": {
    "short": "An archetype is a perfect example or model of something. If you have long blonde hair, a sparkly ball gown, and a fairy godmother hovering over your head, you're the archetype of a fairytale princess.",
    "long": "In the psychology of Carl Jung, an archetype is an inherited pattern of thought derived from the past experience of the whole race and present in our unconscious minds––Cinderella might be an archetype for girls in our culture; the boogey man is another. This noun is from Latin archetypum, from Greek archetypon, from archetypos \"of the first mold,\" from archein \"to begin\" plus typos \"type.\""
  },
  "due": {
    "short": "Things that are due are owed — it's time to come up with them. Loans, library books, and school assignments usually have a due date.",
    "long": "The first question students usually ask when given an assignment is \"When is it due?\" The word due has to do with deadlines and things that are owed. When you're time is up on a library book, it's due. Many bills — such as cable and phone bills — are due once a month. If you miss a due date, you could be in trouble: you might get a bad grade on your paper or the cable guy might take away your favorite stations."
  },
  "omnipotent": {
    "short": "If you want to describe someone who can do absolutely anything, reach for the adjective omnipotent.",
    "long": "Omnipotent comes from the Latin words for total (omni) and power (potent).  Omnipotent is frequently used for deities, but can apply to any exaggerated description of power. If you think that love rules the world, then to you, love is omnipotent. On the other hand, if you think that brute force wins, then maybe your idea of an omnipotent person is a mob boss. The stress is on the second syllable: om-NIP-uh-tent."
  },
  "refulgent": {
    "short": "If someone tells you that you have refulgent eyes, they mean that your eyes shine brightly, like the stars. This suggests that your special someone is the poetic type, since refulgent is a literary way of saying \"bright.\"",
    "long": "The adjective refulgent comes from the Latin fulgere, meaning \"to shine.\" Refulgent is used both literally and figuratively. On a bright day, the sun can be described as refulgent, and the beautiful, sunny weather might cause you to break into a refulgent smile. Refulgent shines brightly among its synonyms: radiant, dazzling, and luminous. You'll typically encounter refulgent in literature and poetry, but using this word is a great way to show off your refulgent mind."

  "mannered": {
    "short": "If someone calls you mannered, it's really not a compliment. It means that the way you act seems artificial or exaggerated. Chill out.",
    "long": "Manners are the way we behave in society, how we speak and act with other people. Use mannered to say that someone has exaggerated or unnatural manners. In combination with other words — as in well-mannered or mild-mannered — mannered can take a positive meaning, but when it's used by itself, it's a criticism. Your pretentious classmate is mannered, and an actor's stilted, phony performance is also mannered."
  },
  "absurd": {
    "short": "Something absurd is really silly, absolutely ridiculous, or total nonsense. Thinking you can wear flip flops and a bikini to the North Pole is an absurd idea, for example.",
    "long": "If you run into someone dressed in an absurd outfit or watch a movie full of absurd jokes, you'll probably have a good laugh. But find yourself dealing with the absurd; you'll likely be stuck in a depressing existential crisis. The absurd describes a state of being where human life has no purpose and everything is completely irrational."
  },
  "incipient": {
    "short": "Incipient means something is in an early stage of existence. In its incipient form, basketball was played with a soccer ball and peach baskets for goals. Bouncy orange balls and nets came later.",
    "long": "Incipient comes from the Latin incipere \"to begin.\" The related, and more commonly used, word inception means the beginning or the start. It is important to note that when something is in an incipient stage, there is a chance it will never come to completion. So be on the lookout for incipient trouble or an incipient crisis — you might be able to prevent it from happening."

  "motivate": {
    "short": "To give someone the incentive to act in a certain way is to motivate that person. If you give your dad a food-processor for his birthday, you might motivate him to help out with the cooking.",
    "long": "The verb motivate means to prompt or incite. By giving speeches on college campuses across the country, John F. Kennedy motivated a lot of young people to join the Peace Corps in the early 1960s. People are not always motivated in positive ways, however. When a crime is described as racially motivated, it means the perpetrators picked their victim because of the color of his skin."
  },
  "embalm": {
    "short": "To embalm is to prepare a body for a funeral or burial. Part of a funeral director's job is to embalm the bodies of people who have died.",
    "long": "Various traditions of death and burial require a dead body to be preserved with chemicals, and when someone does this, she's said to embalm the body. Occasionally, there are also medical research or educational reasons to embalm a body. Embalm has an Old French root, embaumer, \"preserve a corpse with spices.\""

  "contrived": {
    "short": "If you see something that seems fake since it was too perfectly planned out, call it contrived. If you can easily predict the final minutes of a made-for-TV movie, then call it contrived.",
    "long": "The adjective contrived describes something that is artificially planned, especially in an obvious way, so it comes across as faked or forced. It's not just drama that can come off as contrived. Someone's speech habits, wardrobe, or even personality can seem contrived.

  },
  "awry": {
    "short": "When something goes wrong with a decent plan, you say it has gone awry. Losing your backpack is a mistake, but when you realize it contained your ticket and your passport, your vacation plans really go awry.",
    "long": "Wry means \"twisted\" — so going awry means getting \"twisted up.\" Awry is similar to askew, which means \"off, out of line.\" Though when you compare the roots skew, \"turned at an angle\" and wry, \"twisted,\" you see the subtle difference between the two words."
  },
  "insouciant": {
    "short": "Only people with no real troubles can afford to be insouciant during times like these. Runway models are great at looking insouciant, strolling the catwalk apparently without a care in the world.",
    "long": "Some prefer their musical idols to be insouciant, seeming not to care what their fans think or want. Others like them more eager to please, happy to take requests and engage. The two obvious examples are Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis. Armstrong would smile and encourage the audience to participate, while Davis was the insouciant master who showed no concern for or interest in what his listeners might prefer: some people found his insouciant manner irresistible."
  },
  "ridicule": {
    "short": "When you ridicule someone, you mock or make fun of them. They become the object of your ridicule or mockery. Your bad behavior might bring ridicule on your parents, who raised you to know better.",
    "long": "The word ridicule is related to ridiculous. If you ridicule a friend, you try to make them look ridiculous. But now that isn't very friendly! Both words come from the Latin redire which means to laugh. When you are ridiculed, you are made a laughing stock, but being the object of ridicule is never funny."
  },
  "plummet": {
    "short": "The verb plummet means \"to drop sharply,\" like eagles that plummet toward earth, seeking prey, or school attendance that plummets when there is a flu outbreak.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce plummet, say \"PLUH-met.\" This verb describes something that drops sharply or quickly, like a roller coaster that plummets down a hill, temperatures that plummet overnight, or sales of roses and candy that plummet after Valentine's Day. If something plummets, this doesn't mean it will stay down or low forever, just that it has experienced a sharp drop."
  },
  "evacuate": {
    "short": "To evacuate is to flee, like how people leave an area when a hurricane is coming. It also means to empty something completely.",
    "long": "If you have to evacuate your home, something horrible is probably happening, like a natural disaster. People evacuate when something like a tornado or act of terrorism makes their homes unsafe. To evacuate also means to empty completely, in the bathroom-oriented sense of evacuating (emptying) your bowels. Similarly, if a chemist empties and therefore creates a vacuum in a flask, she has evacuated the flask. When you evacuate, you clear out."
  },
  "bombast": {
    "short": "Bombast is a noun meaning pretentious or boastful talk. If your football coach is known for his bombast, he probably gives a pompous speech before each game about the greatness of the team and, of course, his coaching.",
    "long": "Originally, bombast was cotton padding used to stuff or pad things like seat cushions. The meaning was extended to include padded and overstuffed speaking or writing, especially speech that's pretentious and showy. Other words with bombast at their roots include the adjective bombastic and the adverb bombastically. For all your coach's bluster and bombast, he's a pretty nice guy — too bad his overblown rhetoric turns people off before they get to know him."

  "per se": {
    "short": "Per se is the phrase to use when you want to refer to a particular thing on its own. It is not this Latin phrase, per se, that is important, but rather the concept it represents.",
    "long": "Per se is handy when you need to single out a particular element of a bigger thing. So you might say, \"The song, per se, wasn't a bad choice; it was your singing voice that was atrocious.\" In Latin it means \"by itself.\" When you want to sound a little smart, inject a per se into what you're saying. It's one of those phrases, like \"insomuch\" or \"as it were,\" that helps win arguments."
  },
  "vista": {
    "short": "A vista is a scene, view, or panorama. It's what you stop to see when you climb to the top of a mountain, or pull off the road at the \"scenic view\" rest stop.",
    "long": "Vista is an Italian word that means \"sight\" or \"view.\" It's the same in Spanish and is related to the verb avistar, which means \"to catch sight of.\" Hasta la vista! means, literally, \"Until I see you!\" (or, more simply, \"See you later!\"). As in Spain and Mexico, we like to name our towns after a vista: Buena Vista (\"great scenery\"), Chula Vista (\"pleasant view\"), and Rio Vista (\"overlooking the river\") are all places in California."
  },
  "admonish": {
    "short": "To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, admonish him.",
    "long": "Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere, \"to advise, remind,\" admonish is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means \"scold\" or \"rebuke\" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are closer synonyms."
  },
  "ad hoc": {
    "short": "If you call an ad hoc meeting of your knitting buddies, it means the meeting was formed for one particular reason — to knit. Anything ad hoc is either done for one specific purpose, or in an impromptu, last-minute way.",
    "long": "Ad hoc comes from the Latin words meaning \"for this.\" Often the term is used as a criticism, in the sense that something done ad hoc is done hastily and can be ill thought out, serving only to address a problem in the short term. Government programs are often described as ad hoc, for example. But the term can also imply a sense of ingenuity, of impromptu brilliance, or of something happily care-free and devoid of fuss. Like your ad hoc knitting event!"
  },
  "slumber": {
    "short": "Slumber means \"sleep\" — as a verb or noun. If you're a sound sleeper, you might slumber peacefully right through a thunderstorm, your slumber undisturbed.",
    "long": "To slumber is to sleep, sometimes specifically to sleep lightly or doze. You can slumber in your bed, in your airplane seat, or through your alarm in the morning. Slumber can also describe a peacefulness, like your quiet street that seems to slumber early in the morning. The phrase slumber party was first used in the 1940s to mean a gathering held at night, that usually involves very little slumbering."
  },
  "effrontery": {
    "short": "If you rudely behave as if you have a right to something that you have no right to, you're committing effrontery. When a couple stroll into a crowded restaurant, demand the best table, and threaten the staff unless they're seated right away, that's effrontery.",
    "long": "People have been guilty of outrageously self-centered behavior at least since 1715, when effrontery was coined. Tracing to the French word effronté, meaning \"shameless,\" the word effrontery is also connected to brazen, which means \"of brass,\" and describes someone so accustomed to effrontery that he's hardened to it and has no concern for the harm done to others."
  },
  "oracle": {
    "short": "Back in ancient times, an oracle was someone who offered advice or a prophecy thought to have come directly from a divine source. In modern usage, any good source of information can be called an oracle.",
    "long": "In his Apology, Plato claims that the oracle at Delphi played a vital role in the career of the philosopher Socrates, and a Delphic prophecy sets the tragedy of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex in motion. The word oracle can also be used to describe the utterances of a seer or anyone else who is pretty darn good at predicting the future."
  },
  "probity": {
    "short": "Though probity sounds like what you might do with a sharp stick, it actually means being morally and ethically above reproach, or having integrity.",
    "long": "If you show fiscal probity, it means you are responsible and ethical with your money. The story of George Washington chopping down the cherry tree and refusing to lie about it is a story of probity. The story was first told by a pastor, who may have made the whole thing up according to today's scholars, possibly to sell books — no act of probity."
  },
  "retrospective": {
    "short": "Retrospective means looking back. An art exhibit that cover an artist's entire career is called a retrospective because it looks back at the work the artist has produced over many years.",
    "long": "Retro- means back, -spect- means look (think: spectacles), so the word means literally 'a looking back.' Many people take a retrospective look at their lives on birthdays or on New Year's Eve to evaluate events and see how well they've met their goals. You could call the yearly evaluation you get from your boss a retrospective review of your work."
  },
  "doldrums": {
    "short": "Doldrums aren’t drums that you can play like the tom-toms. Rather people use this noun to describe a period of time that is boring, depressing, or characterized by inactivity.",
    "long": "The noun doldrums is derived from the word dull. If you’ve been vegging out in front of the TV for hours, bored out of your mind, you might say you’re \"in the doldrums.\" This word is often used in phrases describing a slump in the economy or as in “the summer doldrums” to describe the hot, lazy days of summer."
  },
  "anomaly": {
    "short": "An anomaly is an abnormality, a blip on the screen of life that doesn’t fit with the rest of the pattern. If you are a breeder of black dogs and one puppy comes out pink, that puppy is an anomaly.",
    "long": "The noun anomaly comes from the Greek word anomolia, meaning \"uneven” or “irregular.” When something is unusual compared to similar things around it, it’s the anomaly. If you are an Olympian who comes from a family of bookish types who all find it strenuous to walk the dog, you are an anomaly."
  },
  "converge": {
    "short": "Use the verb converge to describe something that comes together at a common point: “Thousands of Elvis fans plan to converge on the small Arkansas town where unconfirmed sightings of the deceased superstar eating at a local barbeque restaurant had been widely reported.”",
    "long": "Two roads, a roomful of politicians, or a group of rabid fans — when things come together from different points they converge. Converge traces back to the Latin word vergere, meaning “to bend or to turn.\" The prefix con- means \"with,\" a good way to remember that things that converge come together. Don't confuse it with diverge, which means the opposite: \"move away,\" because the prefix “dis-” means “apart.”"
  },
  "fleeting": {
    "short": "Fleeting is an adjective that describes something that happens really fast, or something that doesn’t last as long as you’d like.",
    "long": "Driving in a car on the highway, you see a unicorn in the woods, but you only get a fleeting glimpse of it because you’re driving too fast.  Bummer.  Fleeting comes from the Old English word flēotan, which means “float, swim.”  Like a ghost ship floating by on a foggy night, fleeting things disappear as fast as they appear.  Fleeting love may last more than a moment, but it won’t stay for very long, and that’s why it’s called fleeting."
  },
  "exhort": {
    "short": "French roots for the word exhort mean \"thoroughly encourage,\" so to exhort is to fill up with encouragement! \"When he heard the crowd exhort him with stomping and cheers, he knew that he could finish the marathon.\"",
    "long": "Some synonyms for exhort include stimulate, excite, and urge on. Words and shouts can exhort, and this is especially true when the recipient of those chants fears coming up short with an effort. Exhortations may make the difference between winning or losing and marching on or giving up. A sergeant might exhort his troops after a defeat just as a dad can exhort his daughter after a missed note during a piano recital."
  },
  "augment": {
    "short": "Do you need to make something bigger, better, or stronger? Then you need to augment it. To augment is to increase the amount or strength of something.",
    "long": "Maybe your bike isn't getting around very well on hills: the bike needs to be augmented with a better set of tires. People augment their computers and phones all the time, adding new gadgets and apps. They augment the storage space in their cars by buying roof racks. If the President decides to augment taxes, taxes are going up. When you see the word augment, think \"More!\""
  },
  "allusion": {
    "short": "That little nod to a Dylan Thomas poem that you sneaked into your PowerPoint presentation? That was an allusion, a quick reference to something that your audience will have to already know in order to \"get.\"",
    "long": "An allusion often references a famous work of art or literature, or to something from your own life. For example, you might say, \"I obviously am no expert at love\" — an allusion to your failed relationships. The main thing to remember is that an allusion is a brief hint or a quick mention. It’s meant to bring to mind a particular subject, but it always avoids getting into it in great depth."
  },
  "vernal": {
    "short": "If you enjoy the vernal lushness of the landscape, that’s a kind of fancy way to say you like the way nature looks in the springtime.",
    "long": "The word vernal entered English in the sixteenth century, tracing all the way back to the Latin word ver, meaning spring. Use the adjective vernal to describe something that occurs in springtime or is related to springtime. You might be familiar with the vernal equinox, which indicates the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The word vernal can also be used more broadly to describe something youthful or fresh — springlike."
  },
  "neutral": {
    "short": "Commonly used to describe a person who doesn’t pick sides in disputes,  neutral also pegs anything that refuses to be bold: the color beige, bland clothing, people with no preferences on where to eat for dinner.",
    "long": "Being neutral sounds kind of boring. But neutrality is really important in some cases: Judges, for example, must remain totally neutral when hearing a case. Manners mavens say that it's best to remain neutral when topics like politics and religion come up during a party. And boxers can look to the neutral corners in the ring to escape a punch."
  },
  "conclusive": {
    "short": "If you've got a theory that you're trying to prove, and you uncover a conclusive piece of evidence, then the case is closed. Conclusive means you've got your answer, you've proved your theory, and there can't be any doubt about it.",
    "long": "If want to prove that frogs can speak, and you record a frog reciting \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,\" that would be conclusive evidence for your claim. But if the frog seemed to be mumbling and mainly making regular old frog noises, critics would say that your video was not conclusive. You can also use the word conclusive to describe winning something easily or by a large margin, like when the talent competition judges handed the tap-dancing bear a conclusive victory, and he moved on triumphantly to the finals."
  },
  "dejected": {
    "short": "If you're ejected from an important game, you're going to feel dejected. If you're rejected by the love of your life, you'll feel dejected again.",
    "long": "Dejected goes beyond down––it's having given up hope. \"After the theater was burned down by Mrs. Jud, the deranged school secretary, the drama students were too dejected even to sing \"Pore Jud is Daid\" from Oklahoma, the only song that might have made them feel better.\""
  },
  "saturnine": {
    "short": "Medieval alchemists ascribed to the planet Saturn a gloomy and slow character. When people are called saturnine, it means they are like the planet — gloomy, mean, scowling. Not exactly the life of the party.",
    "long": "Saturnine is a word you don't hear often nowadays, though you probably know people with saturnine dispositions. The ultimate saturnine character in literature is Heathcliff — and for clarification's sake, that would be the bitter, brooding, obsessive hero of Wuthering Heights, not the lovably pudgy cat of comic-strip fame."
  },
  "munificent": {
    "short": "If you give your best friend a bracelet for her birthday, then you’re a good friend. If you give her a diamond bracelet, a racehorse, and an oil well, then you’re a munificent friend, meaning you are very lavish when it comes to giving gifts. (And it’s possible you may also be broke.)",
    "long": "If you’re the generous type, you may already know that the word munificent traces back to the Latin word munificus, meaning “generous or bountiful,\" which in turn originated from the word munus, meaning “gift or service.” Put those two concepts together and you have big-time gift giving on a lavish scale. Use the word munificent to describe instances of over-the-top generosity — think Oprah on a gift-giving binge at Christmastime."
  },
  "stern": {
    "short": "You know when you've done something really wrong, and the person who gets you in trouble has that unforgiving look on his face? The best word for that look is stern, meaning \"strict\" or \"severe.\"",
    "long": "Stern, strict, severe, harsh, unforgiving — they all more or less mean the same thing, which is very tough and exacting, with a little helping of seriousness thrown in for good measure. What does this have to do with the stern of a boat, also known as the rear area? Um, nothing? But it's good to know about that meaning too, since it could come in handy some day when you're giving directions on a ship."
  },
  "impede": {
    "short": "To impede something is to delay or block its progress or movement. Carrying six heavy bags will impede your progress if you're trying to walk across town in a hurry.",
    "long": "Impede comes from the Latin impedire which literally means \"to hold the feet,\" formed from the prefix in-, (\"in\") plus pes (\"foot\"). Think about walking with a cast on your foot — how slow and awkward that would be. If you struggle with reading, that might impede your progress in your social studies class. An impediment is something that impedes, such as a physical defect that affects speech — a speech impediment."
  },
  "advocate": {
    "short": "An advocate (AD-və-kit) is someone who supports a cause, like an advocate for outdoor recess. Advocate (AD-və-kate) is also a verb meaning to speak in favor of, so you can advocate for that outdoor recess by urging your school to play outside!",
    "long": "As a noun, an advocate is a person who represents another person’s interests, like a lawyer does. In fact, the word comes from the courtroom — it’s from Latin advocare, to “add” a “voice.” To advocate is to add a voice of support to a cause or person. An advocate is anyone who adds that voice by representing another person in court, or by supporting or working toward a particular course of action."
  },
  "redound": {
    "short": "Use the verb redound in formal situations to mean \"contribute\" or \"have an effect.\" You could tell your friend that his patience with unruly children will redound to his reputation as a good school bus driver.",
    "long": "Redound shows up only in the most formal speech and writing, but it's a good way to describe an effect on someone's good name or prestige. Your travels around Asia will redound to your fame as an adventurous traveler, while your unwillingness to talk to your neighbors could redound to your unfriendly reputation. Originally,  redound described something that overflows which is the meaning of the Latin root word, redundare."
  },
  "deplete": {
    "short": "To deplete is to use up or consume a limited resource. Visiting relatives might deplete your refrigerator of food, or a pestering friend might deplete your patience.",
    "long": "The verb deplete is used like “to drain.” A long, exhausting day can deplete your body of energy and a summer drought can deplete a region’s water supply. If you deplete your body of hydration after a lot of exercise, be sure to replete yourself with a nice glass of water."
  },
  "derelict": {
    "short": "If something has been abandoned, you can call it derelict. Even if a person has abandoned his responsibilities, you can say that he is derelict in his duties. But don't call a lost child derelict — unless, of course, he has neglected his chores.",
    "long": "As an adjective, derelict describes something that is rundown, neglected, or in deplorable condition, but the word can also mean \"negligent in duty.\" The politician was so busy using his office for personal gain that he was derelict in his duty to the people who voted for him; he hadn't been present at a vote in months. As a noun, a derelict means a homeless person."
  },
  "penumbra": {
    "short": "When you measure your shadow to calculate the angle of the sun in the sky, be sure to measure to the edges of your shadow, to the penumbra, the part of a shadow that is not as dark as the center.",
    "long": "You're likely to come across penumbra most often in astronomy, as with an eclipse, where shadow is a defining feature. In a lunar eclipse, the edge of the earth's shadow — the part that isn't fully dark — is its penumbra. Sun spots also have a penumbra, the outer edge that's not quite as dark as the center. The word comes from the Latin root umbra, which means \"shadow.\" The pen part means \"almost,\" so a penumbra is \"almost shadow.\""
  },
  "alloy": {
    "short": "You may have heard of aluminum alloy on a car. What that means is that there is another metal mixed in with the aluminum, to save money and/or to strengthen the wheels. The wheels are an alloy (a mix), rather than pure.",
    "long": "In addition to indicating a dilution of one metal with another, alloy can refer to the dilution of a feeling or a quality. Knowing that you look awesome in your Halloween costume would be an alloy to the embarrassment of showing up to a party where you are the only one in a costume."
  },
  "plaintiff": {
    "short": "In a courtroom, the plaintiff is the person or group who is accusing another person or group of some wrongdoing. If you’re the plaintiff, you are claiming that a law was broken, and you’re in court to present your case.",
    "long": "The plaintiff accuses, the defendant tries to prove that accusation wrong.  You’ve seen this relationship on television shows about lawyers, or maybe you’ve been to court yourself.  The Old French root word translates as “complain” and the Latin root is literally “beating of the breast,” or explaining your grief in a dramatic way.  Plaintiff shares roots with the adjective plaintive, which describes a sorrowful sound.  The plaintiff made a plaintive cry when the defendant was declared not guilty."
  },
  "glacial": {
    "short": "Things that are glacial are super cold. A place can be glacial — like the South Pole — but a person can be glacial, too, like that unfriendly girl who gave you a glacial stare.",
    "long": "The word glacial is related to the word glacier, which is a huge piece of ice. If something or someone is glacial, that thing or person is icy. You can give someone you don’t like a glacial look, or you can go skiing on a glacial morning. Glacial comes from the Latin glacies, which sounds like the name of a frozen dessert, but which actually just means \"ice.\""
  },
  "impediment": {
    "short": "An impediment is anything that slows or blocks progress. It can refer to a physical thing, like a fallen tree in the road, or something more intangible, like how your short stature is an impediment to becoming a professional basketball player.",
    "long": "See the pedi in there? Pedi means \"feet\" and hundreds of years ago, the word impediment referred to shackling one's feet.  Now its use has broadened considerably. An impediment is something that blocks or impedes your path. There's no end to the things in your life that can be considered impediments: your small bank account, your terrible childhood, your country's economic malaise — any one of these could be considered an impediment in your quest for happiness."
  },
  "cognate": {
    "short": "When you're learning a new language, a cognate is an easy word to remember because it looks and means the same thing as a word you already know. For example, gratitude in English means the same as gratitud in Spanish.",
    "long": "Just as words that are cognates have a shared origin — like gratitude and gratitud both coming from the Latin word gratitudo, meaning \"thankfulness\" — people can be cognates based on their shared blood. For example, you and your sister are cognates of your parents. You probably even look alike, just like word cognates. The adjective form of cognate can describe blood relations or anyone whose ancestors spoke the same language."
  },
  "insatiable": {
    "short": "If someone can't be satisfied, she is insatiable. After being lost in the woods eating only berries for a few days, you'll find your hunger is insatiable once you finally get to the table.",
    "long": "Insatiable comes from the combination of the negative prefix, in- and the Latin verb satiare, for fill. Someone who is insatiable can never be full.  It can be used for spiritual as well as physical desires. Swift's traveling Gulliver talks about his \"insatiable desire of seeing foreign countries.\" Perhaps you have an insatiable desire to learn all the words in the English language. Synonyms are unappeasable and gluttonous."
  },
  "torpid": {
    "short": "While the adjective torpid sounds a lot like the noun torpedo, it actually describes something slow or even inactive, like the torpedo that's just sitting around before it's launched.",
    "long": "Torpid comes from the Latin word torpere, meaning \"numb,\" which is exactly how torpid things act. A hibernating bear and a caterpillar holed up in a cocoon are two good examples. You might feel torpid sitting in front of the fire after a big meal. The mind, too, can become torpid. The writer Samuel Johnson said, “It is a man’s own fault, it is from want of use, if his mind grow torpid in old age.”"
  },
  "recapitulate": {
    "short": "To recapitulate means to go back and summarize. At the end of an oral report, you might say, \"So, to recapitulate, I've made three points,\" and then you name them.",
    "long": "Recapitulate is a long, scary-looking word that actually means something simple and easy. It comes from the Latin re- \"again\" and capitulum \"chapter,\" which comes from the word caput \"head.\" Think of recapitulating––or recapping, for short––as putting nice little caps on all the bottles you've opened up––tightening everything up."
  },
  "quiescence": {
    "short": "If there's a particular time of day when your ten kittens settle down to nap, you can call that their period of quiescence, or the time when they are all quiet and restful.",
    "long": "The noun quiescence looks similar to the word \"quiet\" for a good reason: quiescence is a quiet spell or state. It's used often to mean \"dormancy,\" or the quieting of a symptom or a disease, such as the quiescence of a child's asthma symptoms during the winter months. The Latin root word is quies, which means \"rest or quiet.\""
  },
  "proclamation": {
    "short": "A proclamation is a formal public statement. If the mayor of your town issued a proclamation honoring the state champion field hockey team, this is an official statement of praise and celebration.",
    "long": "A major statement made in front of an audience or the authoritative word on some subject is a proclamation. It's usually used in an official or government context, although an ordinary person can also make a proclamation, like your proclamation that you'll never dance again after your embarrassment at last week's hip hop recital. The root is proclaim, declare publicly, though the i is dropped in proclamation."
  },
  "bourgeois": {
    "short": "The adjective bourgeois means relating to or typical of the middle class. If someone says, \"Oh, how bourgeois!\" it's probably an insult, meaning you're preoccupied with middle-class small-mindedness.",
    "long": "As a noun, a bourgeois is a member of the middle class, originally a member of the middle class in France. The word was borrowed from French, from Old French burgeis \"citizen of a town,\" from borc \"town, village,\" from Latin burgus \"fortress, castle.\" The derived word bourgeoisie \"the middle class\" is a later borrowing from French."
  },
  "revere": {
    "short": "Revere means to respect someone so deeply that you almost worship them. Many Americans revere civil rights activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, who worked to make the country a more just place.",
    "long": "Revere is related to the words reverence (\"to hold something in worshipful awe\") and its opposite — irreverent. Reverence for the irreverent is actually possible. Howard Stern humor is often vulgar and absurdly irreverent yet his legions of fans and even some media analysts revere him and his ability to maintain a loyal audience. Revere is the perfect word when respect is not strong enough but worship seems a little too religious-sounding. Rock stars, for example, are revered by throngs of devoted fans."
  },
  "deft": {
    "short": "Deft means \"showing cleverness and skill in handling things.\" What you want to see in football or basketball is some deft handling of the ball.",
    "long": "Some people are physically deft, like accomplished athletes and ballet dancers. Their movements are fast, graceful, and deliberate. Others might be mentally or intellectually deft. You could describe a beautifully written essay as deft, or talk about a politician's deft work on an anti-bullying bill. The source of deft is the Old English gedæfte, \"mild or gentle,\" which became deft in Middle English along with its meaning of \"apt, skillful, or adept.\""
  },
  "aviation": {
    "short": "If it has to do with flying or operating a plane, it has to do with aviation. If someone tells you that he's in aviation school, that means he is learning how to fly a plane.",
    "long": "Aviation comes from the Latin avis meaning \"bird,\" an appropriate translation given that aviation deals with travel by air, specifically in a plane. The aviation industry is the business sector dedicated to manufacturing and operating all types of aircraft. Air traffic controllers, when they are awake, are concerned with aviation safety."
  },
  "buttress": {
    "short": "You can buttress an argument with solid facts or your financial portfolio with safe investments. You may find that giving compliments to everyone you meet buttresses your popularity. To buttress is to sustain or reinforce.",
    "long": "A buttress is a structure that adds stability to a wall or building, and this innovation played a significant role in the evolution of architecture. Think of a medieval cathedral. It's an incredibly tall, open building filled with light from vast windows. Without buttresses supporting the walls and carrying the weight of the ceiling away from the building and down to the ground, this cathedral would be impossible. Picture this when you use buttress figuratively as a verb meaning to strengthen and support."
  },
  "aspersion": {
    "short": "An aspersion is a disparaging remark. It almost invariably appears as a plural, following the word \"cast\" — when you cast aspersions on someone, you are questioning their abilities or doubting them.",
    "long": "Finding out that a field-hockey coach had never played the sport might cast aspersions on her ability to coach it. Wendy's ads don't come out and say that McDonald's hamburgers are made out of cardboard, but through shot after shot of their own thick and juicy and oddly square offering, they cast aspersions on the quarter-pounder."
  },
  "illuminate": {
    "short": "To illuminate is to light up — with physical light or with an idea. A spotlight might illuminate an actor on stage, and a good chemistry teacher might illuminate students with a lesson on the atomic structure of hydrogen.",
    "long": "Originally, the verb illuminate referred to decorating handwritten manuscripts with bright lettering or pictures. Monks illuminated manuscripts with colors like gold, silver, bright red, and blue. Nowadays you can illuminate anything in the dark — either literally or figuratively. If you are afraid of the dark, illuminate your bedroom. In the dark when it comes to organic chemistry? Get an illuminating tutor."

  },
  "hedge": {
    "short": "A hedge is a living fence made of closely planted bushes, which, as they grow and get trimmed and shaped, form a wall of green.",
    "long": "Hedge can also be used as a verb. If someone asks you a question and you hedge, you're avoiding a straight answer. If you're not sure what your boss's political views are, you can hedge by not revealing yours. If you hedge your bets, you're trying to minimize risk or loss — that is, you're trying to cover yourself no matter what happens."
  },
  "canned": {
    "short": "Anything canned is stored in a jar or can. It’s usually food, but prerecorded music is also canned. And, if you get fired from a job, you’ve been canned. Don’t cry, though, it’s better than being stuck in a jar.",
    "long": "When someone talks about \"canned goods,\" they mean all the food you can buy that comes in a can, like canned green beans and canned pineapple. Home-preserved food is also canned, even if it's in a glass jar. This adjective takes on a derogatory slant when it describes music that's recorded rather than played live, or an answer that sounds prepared rather than real."
  },
  "bravado": {
    "short": "If you act with bravado, you are making a bold showy statement. Picture a cowboy bursting through saloon doors in an old western, and you can picture bravado.",
    "long": "The noun bravado is derived from the French and Italian words meaning \"bragging and boasting,\" and it is related to the word bravo. Today, the word means an almost-over-the-top amount of courage, but it can also be used (often with the word false) to mean a false show of bravery: \"It was her first day in the classroom and she was almost shaking with fear, but with false bravado — she took a deep breath and turned to face her students — 20 kindergartners.\""
  },
  "abrogate": {
    "short": "Abrogate means to abolish or avoid. When someone cuts in front of you in line, they are abrogating your right to be the next one served. When you cut in line, you are abrogating your responsibility to those who were in line before you.",
    "long": "The Latin root of this word is made up of the prefix ab- \"away\" and rogare \"to propose a law.\" What does it mean if you propose a law away? You repeal it, of course, so abrogate means to officially revoke, cancel or abolish. The meaning of this word has expanded a bit since its earliest usage, but it still appears most often in a legal or political context, or when serious rights and responsibilities are being discussed."

  "vainglorious": {

    "long": "A vainglorious attitude is not very likable in a person and can be annoying to be around. Vainglorious people are vain, excessively boastful, and have swelled pride.  The base word, vainglory, dates all the way back to the 14th century and means “worthless glory.”"
  },
  "eradicate": {
    "short": "To eradicate something is to get rid of it, to destroy it, and to kiss it goodbye.",
    "long": "Eradicate is from the Latin word eradicare meaning \"to root out.\" When you yank that weed up by the roots, it has been eradicated; it's not coming back. Eradicate often means to kill a bunch of somethings, like what you want the poison to do to the roach family and their extended relatives living in your house, and what we thought we did to bedbugs. You can also eradicate corruption, poverty, or diseases. Although there are all kinds of things to get rid of, we usually want to only eradicate the bad things."
  },
  "empirical": {
    "short": "If knowledge is empirical, it's based on observation rather than theory. To do an empirical study of donut shops, you'll need to visit every one you can find.",
    "long": "Empirical looks like empire but comes from a completely different origin: it is from the Greek empeirikos, meaning \"experienced.\" It was originally used in medicine for doctors making choices based on observation and experiment rather than theoretical ideas. It's now used for any kind of knowledge that comes from experience. You can meditate all day on the origins of donuts, but until you visit the donut bakery you'll lack empirical knowledge of donut creation."
  },
  "idol": {
    "short": "An idol can be a religious image or a person who people admire and maybe even seem to worship. A statue of a Hindu god is a religious idol, but Madame Curie is an idol to aspiring scientists.",
    "long": "The word idol comes from the Old French idole for \"pagan god,\" through the Greek eidolon for “reflection in water or a mirror.” In religion, an idol isn’t the real deity but a representation of it. These days, rock stars and celebrities are idols, but so are scientists and writers. If you say Flannery O’ Connor is your idol, you don’t mean you bow down before a statue of the Southern writer, it just means you admire her big time."
  },
  "consent": {
    "short": "Before you have surgery, you'd better give your consent, because the surgeon can't get his scalpel anywhere near your skin without first getting this permission from you.",
    "long": "Consent is permission that can be given or taken away. On the night of the school dance, your parents might consent to extend your curfew by an hour. A homeowner who won't give a developer consent to tear down her house and build a shopping mall might finally consent after receiving a very large check from the developer."
  },
  "erudite": {
    "short": "If you call someone erudite, that means they show great learning. After you've earned your second Ph.D., you will be truly erudite.",
    "long": "Erudite is from Latin verb erudire, \"to teach,\" which comes from rudis for \"raw, unskilled, ignorant\" (the source of our word rude). If you bring someone out of a raw state, you educate them, so someone who is erudite is very educated indeed (and perhaps a bit of a showoff).  You can say either ER-oo-dite or ER-yoo-dite; the second one, being a bit harder to say, can seem a bit more erudite."
  },
  "formulaic": {
    "short": "Anything formulaic follows a formula or pattern, especially in a mechanical, by-the-numbers way. A formulaic TV show is predictable and probably similar to lots of other shows.",
    "long": "Have you ever noticed how many songs are similar to others? When a song is almost identical to previous songs and it’s not very original at all, it's formulaic. This word usually conveys a lack of imagination. If you call a movie formulaic, you're saying it's so much like other movies that it probably didn't need to be made. A formulaic speech follows a pattern that's been used many times before. The opposite of formulaic is original."
  },
  "ebullient": {
    "short": "More than chipper, more than happy, more than delighted is ebullient — meaning bubbling over with joy and delight.",
    "long": "There are two senses of the word of ebullient. One describes an immediate, and ultimately short-lived, reaction to a particular event — for example if you've just won the lottery, you are ebullient. The other describes someone who is perpetually upbeat and cheerful, for example, as in \"an ebullient personality.\" Watch out for ebullient personalities: they can often be \"over the top\" as well."
  },
  "assuage": {
    "short": "If you assuage an unpleasant feeling, you make it go away. Assuaging your hunger by eating a bag of marshmallows may cause you other unpleasant feelings.",
    "long": "The most common things that we assuage are fears, concerns, guilt, grief, anxiety, and anger. That makes a lot of sense — these are all things we seek relief from. The word comes from Old French assouagier, from the Latin root suavis, \"sweet\" — think of adding a bit of honey to something unpleasant. A word with a similar meaning is mollify."
  },
  "pucker": {
    "short": "Pucker is a verb for what happens when something smooth or flat gets folded up into little wrinkles, like how you pucker your lips when you go to kiss someone — you, wild flirt, you!",
    "long": "When you use a sewing machine, sometimes the cloth puckers in wrinkly clumps that make it hard to sew in a straight line.  Most of the time, it’s lips that do the puckering, maybe because you want a kiss, but also sucking on a lemon can make your lips pucker. If someone tells you to “pucker up,” they might want to kiss you, or they might throw a sour pickle at your head. Either way, get ready."
  },
  "defame": {
    "short": "Even though Joan Jett sang about not minding her bad reputation, most of us don't want others to defame us. To defame is to gossip, even if the story is made-up, with the goal of hurting someone's image.",
    "long": "We usually think of fame as a positive thing. Love, admiration, and people wanting to be like you — it all comes with the territory. The de- in defame means \"remove.\" So if someone tries to defame a person, fame — or a good reputation — is taken away. Celebrities protect themselves from those who want to defame them, arming themselves with lawyers."
  },
  "allegiance": {
    "short": "Every second grader knows how to pledge allegiance to the flag, but do you think they realize when they place their right hand over their hearts that they're expressing  loyalty to what we call the \"Red, White, and Blue\"?",
    "long": "You can pledge your allegiance to a flag or swear your allegiance to a government or cause. Either way you're expressing your commitment and devotion in the firmest sense of the word. The liege in allegiance comes from the Old French word meaning \"lord and master,\" which is who you would have been swearing your allegiance to if you'd been a servant in France centuries ago."
  },
  "stifled": {
    "short": "Stifled is an adjective for anything that's been squashed or smothered. You might have a stifled ambition to be an astronaut that you never admitted to others.",
    "long": "Something stifled is stunted, or prevented from growing. If your mother never let you read books or climb trees, your childhood curiosity might have been stifled. Perhaps your career was stifled because you were constantly daydreaming about being an astronaut, and so failed to do your job well."
  },
  "bucolic": {
    "short": "As an adjective, bucolic refers to an ideal country life that many yearn for. If your parents wanted to raise you in a bucolic environment, you may find yourself living 45 minutes away from the nearest movie theater or person your age. Not ideal.",
    "long": "You wouldn’t know it to look at it, but bucolic is a distant relation of cow, and all bucolic’s meanings can be connected to the bovine creature. Bucolic ultimately comes from the Greek boukolos, cowherd or herdsman. A bucolic could be a short poem about pastoral (cow) life or a country person, who is stereotyped as a cowherd. Used as an adjective, bucolic can refer to an idealized rural life (think life with cows) or to herdsmen (more cows). And that’s no bull."
  },
  "verdant": {
    "short": "When something is green with plant life it's verdant, a word often used to idealize the countryside with its verdant pastures or verdant hills.",
    "long": "Here's a trick for internalizing verdant's meaning: If you speak Spanish, think of verde — meaning \"green.\" If you speak French, think of vert. Both French and Spanish inherited their words for green from Latin, in which green is viridis. Verdant also can mean grass-colored: \"She wore a dress of verdant green.\""
  },
  "detect": {
    "short": "The verb detect means to discover or observe the existence of something. If you walk into your house and detect the odor of burnt food, you can deduce from the evidence that you will be going out to dinner tonight!",
    "long": "The verb detect comes from the Latin word detegere, which literally means \"to uncover\" — or more figuratively, to discover. You may detect the presence of a new dog in your house if you note a water bowl, chew toys, and grooming tools. Of course, the large woofing beast that greeted you at the door with a wagging tail might be a big clue as well."
  },
  "divest": {
    "short": "It could be your wine portfolio, your stake in a mining company, or even the extra coats that are taking up space in your closet. Whatever it is, when you divest something, you get rid of it.",
    "long": "Divest is sort of a fancy way to say “dispose of.” It’s often used in a business context to describe companies or governments that divest some of their holdings by selling them off. It can also be used in the sense of taking something away from someone. For example if your boss becomes insane and power mad, his handlers may divest him of his title, meaning his position is taken away from him."
  },
  "inscription": {
    "short": "Inscription is a fancy word for “writing” — the act of writing or a small bit of writing. You weren't excited when you received the card, but the inscription inside made you weep with emotion. Here, have a tissue.",
    "long": "You can see the word script in inscription which can help you remember its meaning. You might find an inscription on a gravestone, on a locket, on a cufflink, or in a book. You were excited to see the inscription dedicating your friend's novel to you, until you fell asleep before page 10. Then you weren't sure what to say."
  },
  "mar": {
    "short": "A mar is a flaw, mark, or blemish, like a deep scratch on a wooden table. As a verb, to mar is to make such an imperfection — like the pen mark that mars your crisp, white shirt.",
    "long": "We often think of things that mar as immediately noticeable, like scratches, scars, and blemishes, but sometimes mar describes other ways of ruining something. For example, an unexpected run-in with a difficult person can mar your relaxing day at the beach, just as an unpleasant memory can mar a peaceful state of mind. The thing to remember is, it only takes one scratch, one mean comment, or one negative experience to mar something that is otherwise fine."
  },
  "indifferent": {
    "short": "If you're indifferent about something, you don't care much about it one way or another. You might feel indifferent about politics, changing the channel whenever the TV news comes on.",
    "long": "People seem indifferent when they're obviously unconcerned — an indifferent observer of a tennis match is clearly not rooting for either player, and an indifferent voter might choose a candidate at the last minute by flipping a coin. A slightly less common meaning of indifferent is \"unbiased or impartial,\" which you can see in its root, the Old French indifferent, or \"impartial.\" In this sense of the word, we all hope our laws and legal system are indifferent."
  },
  "abject": {
    "short": "If it reeks of humiliation or looks like the lowest of lows, then you can safely describe it as abject.",
    "long": "The pronunciation of abject is up for debate: you can decide whether to stress the first or the second syllable. But what's more important is understanding how extreme this adjective is. Abject means absolutely miserable, the most unfortunate, with utter humiliation. You might have heard the phrase abject poverty, which is the absolute worst, most hopeless level of poverty you've ever seen."
  },
  "hotly": {
    "short": "Something that's done hotly happens with anger or excitement. If you hotly debate your school's proposed dress code, it means you have a fierce, passionate opinion about the subject.",
    "long": "If your friend says she heard a rumor that you throw recyclable bottles in the trash, you'll hotly deny it, especially if you care deeply about the environment. And if your English teacher abruptly ends his tradition of pizza parties on the first Friday of every month, the class will hotly object. While this adverb has been around since the 16th century, it originally only referred to temperature, as in \"the fire burned hotly.\""

  "digressive": {

  "confident": {
    "short": "If you're confident you are sure about something, someone, or yourself. He was confident he could keep his balance and cross the river on the skinny log, but he wasn't so confident that the log was strong enough to hold him.",
    "long": "Confident is often a word of assurance. Someone may ask, \"Are you sure that's the right way to do it?\" and then, just to be assured, they might say, \"So, you're confident that's the right wire to cut so the bomb doesn't blow?\" Being really sure of something or being sure of yourself is being confident. \"He held his head high, but not in an arrogant or show-off way; he was just confident about who he was. He liked himself.\""
  },
  "reflective": {
    "short": "Reflective is an adjective that can describe a person who thinks things through, or a surface that reflects light or sound, like the reflective lettering on a stop sign.",
    "long": "To reflect is to bounce back an image, light, or sound. A reflective surface is one that can bounce back light — like the reflective sun shade that you put over the windshield of your car. It bounces the sun's rays away, helping the interior cool. A reflective person is a little different — he or she might have great insight due to taking the time to time carefully about things."
  },
  "prerequisite": {
    "short": "A prerequisite is a required prior condition. If something is required in advance of something else, like if you have to take a beginning Spanish class before signing up for Spanish II, then it’s a prerequisite.",
    "long": "Add pre meaning \"before\" to require and you have something that's \"required before.\" (That's helpful when trying to spell prerequisite!) Prerequisites to be able to graduate from college can seem like a pain, but most schools offer some fun ways to fulfill them. For example, you can often meet the physical education prerequisite by taking bowling.  Prerequisites aren't just for school: “The most called-upon prerequisite of a friend is an accessible ear,” said Maya Angelou, the American poet."
  },
  "assert": {
    "short": "Asserting is all about standing up for what you believe. You might assert an opinion, your innocence, or even your authority over someone else.",
    "long": "The verb assert can be used for both opinions and for oneself. When asked, you can politely assert your desire to go to the amusement park for your birthday. If no one listens to you, you can assert yourself and forcefully state that you really want to go to the amusement park for your birthday. If that fails, you should just take yourself to the amusement park for your birthday. And get better friends."
  },
  "loom": {
    "short": "Loom has two distinct meanings. First, a loom is a tool for weaving. Second, to loom is to appear or stand over someone in a threatening way. Don’t loom over the person you’re teaching to weave! You'll just make her nervous.",
    "long": "The word loom, as an instrument to turn yarn into fabric, comes from an Old English word for “tool.” The verb form, meaning “to lurk just out of view,” comes from Low German or Dutch. Anything that looms is coming into view slowly and isn't something you want to see. Although storm clouds and icebergs can loom, this word does not have to refer to a physical object. If a deadline looms, better get to work."
  },
  "tact": {
    "short": "To talk carefully without hurting anyone’s feelings, that’s tact.  Politicians have tact, which makes them good at speaking about sensitive matters without making fools of themselves.  At least, sometimes they have tact.",
    "long": "Around a friend who’s afraid of snakes, you use tact when talking about reptiles because you don’t want to upset them.  The Latin root word tangere means “touch,” and a person with tact avoids touching dangerous words like they are an electric fence.  When you say something without tact, you “put your foot in your mouth,” as the phrase goes.  You don’t literally put your foot in your mouth, although if you did you’d avoid offending people with words."
  },
  "provisional": {
    "short": "Something provisional is temporary, in the sense that it's only valid for a while. You'll often hear provisional used to describe things such as governments, elections, contracts, and agreements, all of which can change into something permanent.",
    "long": "People who go camping take provisions, which means supplies for the trip. This can be helpful when you're trying to use provisional properly. Remember that those provisions are, well, provisional—they're only supposed to last until the campers get home, where the real food is waiting. If you're in a rush to start filming, you might consider giving your star a provisional contract, so that you can at least get started. You'll have time to replace the provisional one with a permanent one while you film."
  },
  "husband": {
    "short": "A husband is a married man. Your grandfather might joke that he and your grandmother have been husband and wife for so long because she has the patience of a saint and he is deaf as a post.",
    "long": "The word husband comes from the Old Norse hūsbōndi, where hūs meant house and bōndi meant dweller. As a verb, husband means to conserve resources and use them frugally. Because of the flooding in the area, roads are cut off and everyone is being asked to husband their supplies. This conservation of resources sense of husband also occurs in the related noun husbandry."
  },
  "nefarious": {
    "short": "Describe a person's actions as nefarious if they are evil or wicked. Batman and Superman are always fighting evildoers and stopping their nefarious plots.",
    "long": "Nefarious comes from the Latin nefas \"crime, impiety.\" If something is nefarious, it is criminal, evil, malicious and wicked. Thinking of superheroes can help you remember the meaning of the word, but it is often used in much less exciting circumstances. News reporters investigate corrupt politicians in order to uncover the nefarious activities. And, if you don't pay for your downloaded music, you have gotten it by nefarious means."
  },
  "erratic": {
    "short": "The adjective erratic describes things that are unpredictable, unusual, and that deviate from the norm. An erratic quarterback might completely confuse his receivers waiting for a pass.",
    "long": "Like its linguistic relative, error, the adjective erratic means \"deviating from the norm,\" or \"wrong.\" It also implies behavior or qualities that are unpredictable or odd. The word comes from the Latin verb errare, or \"to wander\" off course. In the field of geology, a rock that is erratic is unlike others in its environment because it has been transported by glacial activity. Likewise, someone driving a car that veers out of its lane is said to be driving erratically."
  },
  "acumen": {
    "short": "If you have acumen, you are very sharp at what you do. You hope your accountant and your surgeon are both known for their acumen.",
    "long": "The noun acumen comes from the Latin word acumen, meaning “a point,” or “sting.” If you are able to make pointed decisions, if you have a sharp intellect, if you make good strategic moves, if you are successful in your field, or if your business instincts are spot-on, you have acumen. Even if you inherit an entire wholesale furniture dynasty from your grandfather, you could end up with nothing if you don’t have his business acumen."

  "obelisk": {
    "short": "Next time you visit the nation’s capital, you can wow tourists by telling them the Washington Monument is an obelisk — a tall, narrow stone pillar that tapers to a point at the top and commemorates an important person or event.",
    "long": "Obelisks were all the rage in ancient Egypt and still in vogue in Rome’s heyday. The Egyptians associated the skinny four-sided monoliths with the sun god Ra and thought they looked like the sun’s rays shining down. Herodotus was among the first writers to describe obelisks, and it’s to him that we owe the word; it comes from the Greek obelos, meaning “nail” or “pointed pillar.” History buffs can still spot obelisks, also called “Cleopatra’s Needles,” everywhere from Myanmar to Manhattan."
  },
  "shun": {
    "short": "If you purposely stay away from someone, you shun that person.  A sensitive baker may ask why you are shunning her cookies.",
    "long": "Although the verb shun means to deliberately avoid anything, it has a specific meaning in certain groups and communities. In this case, it means to ostracize or expel from that group or community. The Amish, for example, may shun members of their order who repeatedly ignore the beliefs and rules of Amish society. The word may also be used in more casual group settings. After many attempts at being polite, you and your friends began to shun the obnoxious classmate who never let you get a word in edgewise."
  },
  "mortify": {
    "short": "To mortify someone is to cause them extreme embarrassment. Your mother may not have been trying to mortify you when she showed up at your senior prom with a bunch of unicorn balloons, but she did.",
    "long": "The root of the verb mortify is from the Latin word mors, which means “death.” To mortify something used to mean to destroy its life, but now mortify is mostly used when you feel so ashamed or embarrassed you “want to die.” To punish yourself through deprivation from food or another desire, you can mortify that compulsion, but it’s probably best to just mortify your parents by showing up at their work place with a new mohawk."
  },
  "grovel": {
    "short": "To grovel is to beg like a hungry dog. You don't have to be a canine though; you might grovel for a better grade (please don't).",
    "long": "If you grovel you risk getting the opposite of what you want, because people (like teachers) don't like people down at their feet begging for something. But if you cheat on your date, you may have to grovel to get him or her back. Grovel also means to crawl around on your belly — you could grovel on gravel, but that might really hurt. The word comes from the Vikings; in Old Norse the word grufe means \"prone\" (lying flat) which is probably how Vikings liked to see the people they were conquering. You grovel when you want something but also when you're afraid."
  },
  "exacting": {
    "short": "Use the adjective exacting to describe something or someone very precise or strict in its requirements. If your teacher has exacting standards about spelling and punctuation, you better carefully check your final paper.",
    "long": "An exacting person expects things to be, well, exact. For this reason, demanding is a good synonym. Friends who are exacting might let you have it if you show up a minute or two late. Some exacting people are extremely selective about what they eat, rejecting anything that doesn't meet their complicated standards of nutrition and taste."
  },
  "euphemism": {
    "short": "Pardon me, but when a polite term is substituted for a blunt, offensive one, you should call it a euphemism.",
    "long": "Euphemism is from Greek euphemismos, meaning \"good speech,\" and it's a way that we paper over uncomfortable things with more pleasant-sounding words. These days we tend to use euphemisms when talking about anything having to do with elimination of bodily waste: toilet, bathroom, and water closet were all originally euphemisms. The military is also notorious for using euphemisms, like saying \"neutralizing the target\" instead of \"killing someone.\""
  },
  "unkempt": {
    "short": "Unkempt literally means “not combed,” but use it to describe anything with a sloppy appearance. Your hair probably looks unkempt when you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep it that way if you're going for the rock star look.",
    "long": "From the fusing of un- “not” with kempt “neat” comes the adjective unkempt. Kempt has fallen out of use, but unkempt persists as a popular word to describe anything unpolished, rough, or disorderly. Pig sties, the corrals where pigs live, are usually quite unkempt. That's why your mom keeps calling your messy, unkempt train wreck of a room a pig sty."
  },
  "officious": {
    "short": "Though officious sounds like official, it means being annoyingly eager to do more than is required. \"The officious lunch lady made everyone's food choices her business, and made nasty comments when students chose cookies over carrots.\"",
    "long": "Officious is a tricky word as it seems like it might mean something like office or official. Instead, it is a word to describe someone that acts more official than they actually are. People who are officious are busybodies. They want to make their opinions known and followed, despite not having any kind of real power."
  },
  "prattle": {
    "short": "To prattle is to go on and on about something unimportant. Some people don't like your constant prattling about your collection of Lego figurines — but you're convinced it's the most fascinating topic on the planet!",
    "long": "Prattle can also be a noun. If your little sister won't leave you and your friends alone, you might complain to your parents about her constant prattle. And the constant prattle of the person in the next seat might make it difficult for you to nap on that long airplane trip. There are a lot of funny-sounding words with a meaning similar to prattle: chatter, blether, blather, jabber, gabble, blabber, and babble, to name a few."
  },
  "liturgy": {
    "short": "A liturgy is like a script for a religious service, the official set of rules for performing a religious ceremony.",
    "long": "Liturgy has everything to do with the way people worship in public. In fact, this noun comes to us from the Greek word leitourgia, which means \"public service, worship of the gods.\" In Christianity, The Liturgy is a specific service for the sacrament of the Eucharist. But every religion has their own form of liturgy or set way of performing certain worship rituals."
  },
  "repast": {
    "short": "Whether it's a sumptuous feast you're sitting down to or just a simple bite to eat, repast is just another word for \"meal.\"",
    "long": "Based on the Latin word repascere, which means \"to feed,\" a repast is any collection of food served and eaten at one time. In verb form, repast means to eat or feast. So at least by dictionary standards, you should feel free to repast on cheese doodles and marshmallow fluff for your morning repast — in other words, eat junk for breakfast."

  "viable": {
    "short": "When something is viable, it has the ability to grow or function properly. A viable seed can develop into a plant, while a viable company has the resources to succeed.",
    "long": "The adjective viable refers to something able to function properly and even grow. It is made up of the Latin root vita, which means \"life,\" and the ending -able, which means \"to be possible.\" In terms of science or botany, when a plant is viable it can live and flourish in an environment such as a cactus in the desert. Consider also the Wright brothers, who were the first to develop a viable airplane after many tries and spectacular failures."
  },
  "banish": {
    "short": "To banish is to get rid of. Think very carefully before you banish someone from your group. Someday, you may want that person around again.",
    "long": "Banish rhymes with vanish, which is exactly what happens when you banish someone. Suppose a king, angry with some of his subjects, banishes them. They have to leave the kingdom and vanish — not just go home and wait for the king to change his mind. Banish comes from the Old French word banir, which means “proclaim as an outlaw.” It is serious and absolute. You can see the word ban in banish, but to ban something is not as harsh as banishing it."
  },
  "chromatic": {
    "short": "The adjective chromatic is useful for describing things related to color, like the beautiful chromatic variation of the sky at sunset.",
    "long": "You could describe the chromatic intensity of a fireworks display or the excellent chromatic perception of an artist, who is skilled at seeing nuances of color. In physics, the word chromatic has to do with the scientific aspects of color and light. The earliest uses of chromatic, in the 1590s, only referred to music, but by the 1800s it was used to mean \"color,\" which is also the meaning of the Greek root, khroma."
  },
  "exterminate": {
    "short": "If your house becomes infested with cockroaches, mice, or even ants, you might have to exterminate them. It is certainly not a pleasant process, but often quite necessary.",
    "long": "To exterminate means \"to kill off or destroy completely.\" Notice that it includes the word terminate which means, “to end.” It is usually used in reference to insects or rodents, but also unfortunately in reference to people or groups of people. It is just a coincidence that this verb shares a syllable with termite — a bug that often has to be exterminated before it eats through the wood of your home."

    "long": "You're most likely to find the adjective encyclopedic describing the word knowledge. If your knowledge about any subject is encyclopedic, it means you know as much about it as an encyclopedia — a book crammed full of information — could tell you. In fact, encyclopedic comes from encyclopedia, a modern Latin word that's based on a misreading of the Greek enkyklios paideia as \"general education.\" The phrase actually means \"training in a circle.\""

  "countenance": {
    "short": "The noun countenance means the face or its expression. If you're a great poker player, you probably have a calm countenance.",
    "long": "Countenance comes from a French word for \"behavior,\" but it has become a fancy term for either the expression of a face or the face itself: \"He had a puzzled countenance,\" or \"what a charming countenance!\" Countenance can also be a verb meaning to tolerate or approve.

    "short": "The adjective philosophic is used to describe the study of deep thinking. If you have a philosophic attitude, you face trouble with a level head, like a deep thinker.",
    "long": "To some extent, you can use philosophic interchangeably with the more widely-used philosophical whenever you're talking about philosophy. It's more common, though, to save philosophic for the academic discipline rather than a more general context. So you might discuss the philosophic texts in your ethics class or Marx's philosophic thoughts on a particular subject. The word philosophic can also describe being calm in the face of defeat or loss. Philosophic comes from the Greek philosophia, \"love of knowledge.\""

  "remonstrance": {
    "short": "A remonstrance is an objection or protest, the expression of earnest opposition. Just like a protest, PETA members might hold a remonstrance outside a fashion show of a luxury fur and leather designer.",
    "long": "Notable remonstrances include the \"Five Articles of Remonstrance\" (1610), protesting the Calvinist doctrine of predestination; the \"Great Remonstrance\" (1641), presented to the English people by Parliament, detailing the \"evils\" of King Charles I; the \"Flushing Remonstrance\" (1657), protesting a ban on Quaker worship in what would later become New York City; and the \"Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments\" (1786), opposing a bill in the Virginia General Assembly that would levy taxes to pay for religious teachers."
  },
  "rend": {
    "short": "The verb rend means to tear with force or violence, or into many pieces. Your parents won't be happy if your new kitten decides to rend their brand new curtains with her tiny claws.",
    "long": "Tear, rip, and rend are all synonyms, but it's a question of degree. Of the three, rend implies the most violent separation. You can also use rend figuratively to express great emotional distress or to describe a sharp, piercing sound. If you're betrayed by a friend, it rends your heart right out of your chest."
  },
  "vitriol": {
    "short": "Vitriol is harsh, nasty criticism.  You may have deserved some blame when the cake didn't rise, but the head chef's stream of vitriol was unnecessary.",
    "long": "Back in the day, vitriol was the name for sulfuric acid, which burns through just about anything. So think of vitriol as language so mean-spirited and bitter that it could eat through metal: \"As a divorce lawyer, you were familiar with vitriol, but nothing prepared you for the time you wore a Red Sox cap at Yankee Stadium.\""
  },
  "jeopardize": {
    "short": "Jeopardize means to put at risk or pose a threat. Jeopardize your career by posting silly pictures of yourself on Facebook. Jeopardize your friendships by posting silly pictures of your friends on Facebook.",
    "long": "Jeopardize stems from the Old French jeu parti, which literally translates to a game with divided, or even, chances.  An even chance of winning hardly seems a risky endeavor, but maybe our forefathers weren't big risk-takers. Whatever the reason, jeopardize has come to mean the act of putting yourself or something at risk, through circumstance or behavior. Think of double-jeopardy on the gameshow \"Jeopardy\" and you'll better understand what it means to jeopardize your savings."

  "convoluted": {
    "short": "If something is convoluted, it's intricate and hard to understand. You'll need to read over your brother's convoluted investment scheme a few times before deciding whether or not to go in on it.",
    "long": "Convoluted comes from the Latin convolutus for rolled up together. Its original meaning in English was exactly that, first for eaves coiled up on themselves, then for anything rolled or knotted together. Over time convoluted took on its metaphorical sense of complicated and intricate, which is how it's generally used today. People complain about convoluted legal language and the convoluted tax code."
  },
  "archaic": {
    "short": "If you use the adjective archaic you are referring to something outmoded, belonging to an earlier period. Rotary phones and cassette players already seem so archaic!",
    "long": "The adjective archaic means something that belongs to an earlier or antiquated time. It can also mean something that is outdated but can still be found in the present and therefore could seem out of place. The word comes from archaic (i.e., ancient) Greek, archaikos, and literally means \"from Classical Greek culture,\" though its meaning has broadened as it's been used in English."
  },
  "stimulus": {
    "short": "A stimulus causes an action or response, like the ringing of your alarm clock if you didn't sleep through it.",
    "long": "Stimulus is a word often used in biology — something that causes a reaction in an organ or cell, for example. In financial and economic contexts, a stimulus may be an incentive: the money you spend on your membership is a stimulus for hitting the gym. Though it can be a synonym for stimulant, they are not always used interchangeably. A stimulant is often a chemical or drug that increases activity — think caffeine. For more than one stimulus, use stimuli, not stimuluses."
  },
  "emend": {
    "short": "When you emend a piece of writing, you correct or revise it. If you are asked to emend a report, that just means you need to go through it and make revisions.",
    "long": "Emend is similar in spelling and pronunciation to another word, amend, and there’s a slight overlap in meaning as well. Emend refers to changes and improvements made to a text. Amend also can refer to making minor changes to a text, but it can be used to describe improvements made to other things as well — for example, you can amend a situation. In contrast, emend’s powers are limited to words. So if you’re using emend — the one with the \"e\" — just make sure you’re describing improvements that involve text."
  },
  "implacable": {
    "short": "An implacable person just can’t be appeased. If you really offended your best friend and tried every kind of apology but she refused to speak to you again, you could describe her as implacable.",
    "long": "Implacable is derived from the verb to placate, which means to soothe, or to appease. If you’re babysitting and the kid starts screaming the moment that his parents leave the house, and nothing you give him, be it a toy or ice cream, can calm him down, he might seem implacable. But try the TV. It tends to turn screaming kids into silent, happy zombies."
  },
  "thwart": {
    "short": "A villain's worst nightmare is the superhero who always seems to thwart his efforts, preventing him from carrying out his plans to take over the world.",
    "long": "Thwart is a word you'll hear in a lot of action movies, and usually it's the hero who is trying to thwart the evil plan of some super-villain. Yet even mere mortals can be thwarted in their efforts; the word simply means to prevent someone from carrying out his or her plans. An aggressive driver can thwart your attempt to snag a parking space at a crowded mall by pulling into the space before you. An aggressive shopper at that same mall can thwart your efforts to buy the last Dancing Snoopy doll by grabbing it off the shelf first."
  },
  "deprave": {
    "short": "Use the verb deprave as a more dramatic synonym for corrupt: Some parents in the 1980s feared that heavy metal music would deprave their innocent children.",
    "long": "You have probably heard the expression \"the way to a man's heart is through his stomach,\" meaning the sense of taste, when triggered, can inflame feelings like love and passion. Taken to extremes, though, too much indulging of any of the senses can make someone depraved, addicted to or fixated on feeling good. This pursuit of excess is the opposite of a word that sounds and looks like depraved: deprived."
  },
  "rectitude": {
    "short": "Rectitude refers to behavior that is correct, upright and honorable. You have moral rectitude if you refuse to be involved with a plan that some kids in your class have to cheat on a test.",
    "long": "This is a word that's easy to remember! First of all, rectitude sounds like rector, a member of the clergy, who is supposed to be a person with a highly moral ... 'tude, if you will. It also has the same prefix as rectangle, that most upright of geometric figures. If someone talks about fiscal rectitude, they are concerned with doing the right thing financially."
  },
  "deterrent": {
    "short": "A deterrent makes you not want to do something. Let's say there's a giant pile of cookies being guarded by an angry dog — the dog is a deterrent.",
    "long": "People talk about deterrents most often when discussing crime. The death penalty is supposed to be a deterrent — the idea is that people will be so scared of the death penalty that they won't commit certain crimes. Jail is another deterrent. Teachers also use deterrents — the possibility of getting detention is a deterrent that should encourage students to behave. A deterrent is the opposite of a reward. A reward encourages you to do the right thing, while a deterrent discourages you from doing the wrong thing."

  "digress": {
    "short": "If we're talking about science fiction, and you suddenly go off on a long tangent about the cost of grape soda, you digress. When a person digresses, they stray from the topic.",
    "long": "It's easy to understand why you digressed from the main topic. You were incredibly excited, speeding on caffeine, and, let's face it, you've never been at a loss for words. Don't get me wrong: I love your wanderings — how you drift from one topic to the next, letting your mind explore. The problem was that the meeting was running late and there was no time to let you digress. I had to pull you back to the main topic. I didn't want our potential new partners to get the idea that these digressions were typical."
  },
  "salute": {
    "short": "A salute is a sign of respect. A soldier may salute senior officers by raising a hand to his or her head, or you may informally salute a neighbor with a tip of your hat.",
    "long": "Salute often has a military context, whether used as a verb or a noun. When gladiators showed up for a day’s work at the Coliseum in Ancient Rome, they had to be prepared to die in battle for the entertainment of the emperor.  Beforehand, they would address the emperor with the Latin words “morituri te salutant”, which means “Those of us who are about to die salute you.”  Many centuries later, the heavy metal band AC/DC would change those words to a song with a much happier sentiment: “For those about to rock, we salute you.” Rock on."

    "long": "If you're described as vicious, you're someone who does brutal things on purpose, out of ill-will towards others, like beating up defenseless puppies or poisoning the drinking water for a town. You're worse than just mean if you are vicious — in fact, you're evil! People (and puppies) will be wise to keep their distance. Other things, like gossip, animals, or cars from horror movies can be vicious, too."
  },
  "mentor": {
    "short": "A mentor is a person who trains and guides someone, like the second-grade English teacher who saw the spark of creativity in your writing and encouraged you to become a professional author.",
    "long": "The original Mentor was a character in Homer's epic poem The Odyssey; Mentor looked after Odysseus's family, particularly his son Telemachus, while Odysseus was off fighting in the Trojan War. Today the word is used to describe any person who acts as an advisor or teacher. As a noun, mentor describes the coach who taught you to play baseball. As a verb, mentor is what the coach does to help you improve your swing."

  "chronic": {
    "short": "If you smoke a cigarette once, you've simply made a bad choice. But if you're a chronic smoker, you've been smoking for a long time and will have a hard time stopping.",
    "long": "The word chronic is used to describe things that occur over a long period of time and, in fact, comes from the Greek word for time, khronos. If you have chronic asthma, it is a recurring health issue for you. No one likes a chronic liar! A problem that cannot be solved can also be called chronic - think of the chronic food shortages in certain parts of the world."
  },
  "juvenile": {
    "short": "If you're being juvenile, you're not acting your age.  Unless of course you are a juvenile.  In which case, carry on.",
    "long": "While the noun juvenile refers to someone not physically or emotionally mature, the word is often used as an adjective to refer to anything specifically for young people, such as juvenile reading materials or movies.  It can be derisive, as in \"Don't act so juvenile,\" suggesting a silliness unbecoming an adult.  The word comes from the Latin juvenīlis, meaning \"youthful\" — similar, but much more flattering."
  },
  "stockade": {
    "short": "A stockade is an enclosed pen used to herd cattle and other livestock. Stockades can also house people, in the sense of a penal camp. In both cases, the treatment tends to be on the rough side.",
    "long": "Stockades are also built as a means of protection or defense. Fun fact: Did you know that one of the most famous stockades in America was the original Wall Street in New Amsterdam — that is, the protective wall of wooden stakes dug into the ground that separated the northernmost part of the Dutch settlement from Native American territory? Or at least it did until the Dutch, in need of firewood, chopped it down."
  },
  "glower": {
    "short": "If you see someone glower at you, you might consider glowering back, but no one likes an angry staring contest. To glower is not only to stare, it's to stare angrily, as if you're going to throttle someone.",
    "long": "You might already have guessed that glower isn't of Greek or Latin origin, since it doesn't ring any of those bells. Chances are that glower comes from northern Europe, where it's related to some old words that mean to \"glow.\" It was probably in the 18th century that it took on the meaning \"stare at angrily or sullenly.\" You can use its root, glo, to recall its meaning: a person that glowers seems to glow with anger."
  },
  "genteel": {
    "short": "Although the adjective genteel means high-class and refined, it is often used today in a somewhat mocking tone, as though good manners and elegance are passé. Still, it would be nice if more people were a little more genteel.",
    "long": "The word genteel comes from the Old French word gentil, \"high-born, noble.\" We can see the similarity to the word gentle, as in gentleman and gentlewoman. The word is especially powerful in describing Chaucer's Knight in the Canterbury Tales as \"a verray, parfit gentil knyght\" — \"a true, perfect, noble knight,\" dignified, patrician, and as genteel as they come. Today, it describes someone elegant, fashionable, and well-bred. Picture someone in riding jodhpurs reading \"Town and Country\" while astride a magnificent show horse."
  },
  "monotonous": {
    "short": "When something goes on and on and on and on and on, the same way, for a long time, that's monotonous. Monotonous things are boring and repetitive, like that long story you've heard your brother tell a hundred times before.",
    "long": "Ever hear a song that just sounds like the same thing over and over? Ever hear a dog that keeps barking all day? Or a voice that's dull and unchanging in tone? All those things are monotonous: they don't change much, and they're dull as dishwater. Anything tedious or humdrum is probably monotonous. If someone says you're being monotonous, try to vary your tone of voice or the things you're talking about."
  },
  "invidious": {
    "short": "Something can be described as invidious when it is resentful, discriminatory or envious, as in: \"Fred was angered by the invidious gossip about his divorce being spread by his ex-wife's allies.\"",
    "long": "The adjective invidious is used to describe an act, thought, opinion or critique that is full of ill will or prejudice.  It comes from a Latin word that means \"hostile.\"  When the captain of a cheerleading squad says nasty things about an opposing cheer team's skills, work ethic, and uniforms, those are invidious comments."
  },
  "euphony": {
    "short": "Shakespeare's language is a good example of euphony: pleasant, musical sounds in harmony, as with “To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow / Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.”",
    "long": "Use euphony to describe music or poetry. To understand it, break it down: eu- means good; phon- means sound or voice. Of course, just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, euphony is in the ear of the listener — it's subjective. Kids and their parents rarely find euphony in the same song."
  },
  "accost": {
    "short": "To accost is to approach someone aggressively or confront them in an inappropriate way.",
    "long": "Accost describes a confrontation — one that's often aggressive in nature. You're likely to be accosted by angry picketers if you wear your finest fur coat to a march against animal cruelty. The paparazzi make their living by accosting celebrities, pushing in close to snap candid photos as the stars leave their limos."
  },
  "sip": {
    "short": "When you drink a small amount of something, you sip it. If your cocoa is extremely hot, you should probably sip it until it cools off a little bit.",
    "long": "You may sit in a corner and sip your punch at a dull party, but when your long hike leaves you parched, it's hard to sip from your water bottle instead of guzzling. As a noun sip means \"small drink,\" like a sip of Coke or a sip of soup. The origin of sip isn't clear, though we know it's related to the Old English supan, \"take into the mouth a little at a time.\""
  },
  "quarantine": {
    "short": "If you contract something highly infectious, such as pinkeye, please quarantine yourself so that you don’t infect others with it. This means you’ll have to stay in isolation and avoid contact with other people.",
    "long": "Starting in the 16th century, a quarantine lasted specifically 40 days. The word is in fact derived from the Latin quadraginta, which means \"forty.\" Originally, this referred to the amount of time a widow could remain in her deceased husband’s house, then referred to the period of time a ship had to wait off a country’s port if its passengers were disease-stricken. Now, it can mean a period of isolation of any length, and can be used as both a verb and a noun."
  },
  "pertinacious": {
    "short": "If you won’t take no for an answer, you’re pertinacious. The same holds true if you stubbornly push on a door despite a sign that says “pull.” Pertinacious means unyielding or perversely persistent.",
    "long": "We get pertinacious from the Latin pertinax, which combines per-, \"thoroughly,\" with tenax, \"tenacious.\" You can impress your friends by dropping pertinacious into conversation when referring to anyone who is bullheaded and obstinately stuck in their ways and opinions. If a Girl Scout is a pertinacious salesperson you might buy fifty boxes of Thin Mints when you only wanted one."
  },
  "dogmatic": {
    "short": "To be dogmatic is to follow a set of rules no matter what. The rules might be religious, philosophical, or made-up, but dogmatic people would never waver in their beliefs so don’t even think of trying to change their minds.",
    "long": "Dogmatic goes back to the Greek words dogma, which means basically “what one thinks is true” and dogmatikos, “pertaining to doctrine.” To be dogmatic is to follow a doctrine relating to morals and faith, a set of beliefs that is passed down and never questioned. It also refers to arrogant opinions based on unproven theories or even despite facts. Someone dogmatic might insist that dinosaurs never existed or that women shouldn’t drive. Dogmatic people are usually not very popular."
  },
  "macerate": {
    "short": "When you macerate something, you soften it by soaking it in a liquid, often while you're cooking or preparing food.",
    "long": "To macerate strawberries, all you have to do is sprinkle sugar on them, which draws out their juices so they become soft and sweet and deliciously saucy. Macerate is sometimes also used to mean \"cause to grow thin or weak,\" or in other words, to make someone feel like a soft, squishy strawberry."
  },
  "naught": {
    "short": "When things come to naught, they've come to nothing. If you feel bad about ending up with nothing, you can also say \"It was all for naught!\"",
    "long": "Have you ever put a lot of work into something and all you ended up with was nada, nil, nothing, zero, zilch, and zip? Then your efforts came to naught. Naught is a word for nothing that is used in specific ways, usually when a project or effort comes to naught."
  },
  "hypocrisy": {
    "short": "People who tell you not to eat candy while they chomp away on licorice all day? People who say they hate cars but always beg you for a ride? They are engaging in hypocrisy, or behavior that is different from what they say they believe.",
    "long": "A hypocrite is a person who practices hypocrisy: what they say is not what they do. The noun hypocrisy descends from the Greek hypokrisis \"acting on a stage,\" from hypokrinesthai \"to play a part, pretend,\" from the prefix hypo- \"under\" plus  krinein \"to judge.\" Many times kids are enraged by their parents' hypocrisy when parents make their children follow rules they don't follow themselves."
  },
  "analogous": {
    "short": "Use the adjective analogous to describe something that is similar to something else and can be compared to another.",
    "long": "Analogous things can be compared to each other, so a near synonym is the adjective comparable. Analogous is a term used in biology to refer to body parts that have a similar function but differ in structure, such as the wings of a bird and the wings of an airplane. Analogous is from Latin analogus, from Greek analogos, meaning \"according to a proper ratio or proportion.\""
  },
  "mutable": {
    "short": "Something or someone that is mutable is subject to change. Mutable weather can go from sunny, to rainy and windy, and back to sunny again.",
    "long": "The word mutable originally had a negative connotation, and it referred to a person, usually a poet, who frequently changed his mind and moods. Mutable has come to mean anything that is capable of changing form or quality. If your favorite restaurant offers seasonal food, the menu is probably mutable with the change in seasons. In science, the word mutable refers to an organism or a gene that, for better or worse, changes its form."
  },
  "aqueous": {
    "short": "When something has an aqueous appearance, it looks watery or has the effect of water. Some marble can appear aqueous or have a watery-looking surface pattern.",
    "long": "The word aqueous comes from the Latin aqua meaning \"water.\" If you flip over a product package and read its ingredients, often you'll see water listed at the top, which means that whatever is inside is an aqueous solution, or one that contains water. Salt water is an example of an aqueous solution because salt easily dissolves in water. Essentially, something aqueous either resembles water or is made from water."
  },
  "pith": {
    "short": "Pith is the central idea or essence of something. If you’re in danger, you could exclaim, “I would greatly appreciate it if someone would provide assistance.” Or, you could get right to the pith of your point by shouting, “Help!”",
    "long": "In botanical terminology, pith refers to a spongy, central cylinder of tissue found inside the stems of most flowering plants. If you know a lot about plants, that fact should help you remember the primary definition of pith. If not, just take our word for it. You can think about the pith of an argument like the pith of a plant: both lie at the heart or core of something."
  },
  "rogue": {
    "short": "A rogue is a sneaky person who has tricks up his sleeve, not like a magician, but like someone who would steal your wallet or cheat at cards.",
    "long": "Dishonesty won’t get you far in life, unless you are a rogue who survives by lying and exploiting others.  The word comes from the Latin rogare, which means “beg,” and while some rogues dress like beggars to get your money, anyone who deceives is a rogue, like the presidents of corrupt corporations who steal from their employees, or that rogue Uncle Marvin who promises you chocolate for washing his car, but afterward tells you he has no chocolate.  That rogue!"
  },
  "obfuscate": {
    "short": "Some people are experts at obfuscating the truth by being evasive, unclear, or obscure in the telling of the facts. The people who are good at obfuscating would include defense lawyers and teenagers asked about their plans for Saturday night.",
    "long": "Although the verb obfuscate can be used in any case where something is darkened, less clear, or more obscure, it is most frequently used in reference to things like ideas, facts, issues, or the truth. The usual implied meaning is that this obfuscation is done deliberately. Politicians often obfuscate the truth about the issues to win support for their positions so they can win elections."
  },
  "vigilance": {
    "short": "Vigilance is devoted attentiveness or watchfulness. Security guards and test proctors alike need to practice vigilance.",
    "long": "Vigilance comes from the Latin word for \"wakefulness,\" vigilantia, and in a medical setting vigilance is still sometimes used to mean \"insomnia.\" A prison guard might be required to maintain vigilance the whole time she's working, always being alert and watchful."

  "rebuke": {
    "short": "If you receive a rebuke, it means that you have been reprimanded, or scolded. You're sure to get a rebuke if you forget to do your math homework four days in a row.",
    "long": "The word rebuke can be a verb, meaning to sternly reprimand or scold, but it can also be a noun, because a rebuke is the result of being scolded. The root comes from the Old French rebuchier and means \"to hack down,\" or \"beat back.\" A rebuke, then, is meant to be critical and to chide — in today's terms, a rebuke is verbal smack-down!"
  },
  "providential": {
    "short": "If your best friend pulls up beside you in her convertible just as your bike gets a flat tire, you could call it providential, or magically lucky.",
    "long": "The Latin root of providential is providentia, \"foresight or precaution.\" Providence changed over the years; it usually referred specifically to the care of God, and it was spelled with a capital P. Providential, likewise, has another meaning that's purely religious, \"resulting from God's intervention.\" Whether you're talking about God or not, if something is providential, it feels a little miraculous."
  },
  "tyro": {

    "long": "Tyro isn't used much these days but it's similar to newbie, novice, or recruit. We have all been tyros at some point. Tyro can also be used as an adjective to describe someone new to a particular scene — such as \"the tyro congressman\" or \"the tyro quarterback.\""

  "reckon": {
    "short": "Reckon means guess, or imagine, and is often used by rural types in Hollywood movies who say things like \"I reckon I'll be moseyin' on.\"",
    "long": "Reckon means guess or think, as in \"I reckon he's put his nose where it don't belong one too many times.” If reckon sounds odd, that’s because it's mostly gone out of style. When used to talk about prediction, it's a little more common, as in \"Who do you reckon is going to win the Super Bowl?\" Still, it sounds a little old-fashioned. Many people use the word just for fun. Saying \"I reckon\" sounds more humorous than \"Yes.\""
  },
  "congruent": {
    "short": "The adjective congruent fits when two shapes are the same in shape and size. If you lay two congruent triangles on each other, they would match up exactly.",
    "long": "Congruent comes from the Latin verb congruere \"to come together, correspond with.\" Figuratively, the word describes something that is similar in character or type. Are your actions congruent with your values? If a friend says something outrageous that you don't want to agree with but don't want to disagree with either, say that your friend's idea is congruent with what you think. That way you can agree with him but change your mind later if you have to."
  },
  "stickler": {
    "short": "A stickler is someone who insists that things are done in a certain way. Say you’re getting married and want to write your own vows, but your partner’s mother demands that you have a traditional ceremony. The mother is a stickler for tradition.",
    "long": "Stickler has its origins in a word meaning umpire, which may allude to a stickler’s bossy nature. Difficult problems or puzzles are called sticklers. It is helpful when remembering the definition of stickler that it has the word “stick” in it. So someone who “sticks” to the rules is a stickler."
  },
  "crass": {
    "short": "A crass comment is very stupid and shows that the speaker doesn't care about other people's feelings. In today's day and age, you don't have to wear black to a funeral, but to show up in clown pants is simply crass.",
    "long": "The source of this adjective is Latin crassus, \"thick, dense, fat.\" A similar development of meaning can be seen in English dense in the sense of \"stupid, slow to understand,\" from Latin densus, \"thick, dense,\" and in English thick, which can also be used to mean \"stupid.\""
  },
  "dupe": {
    "short": "A dupe is a furry, ceremonial hat worn during ancient pagan rituals...or not. Dupe actually means “trick or deceive.” We’re sorry we tried to dupe you into believing the wrong definition.",
    "long": "Dupe can also refer to the victim of a trick or hoax, and — used in this sense — it sometimes conveys the idea that the victim is easily fooled. Dupe comes from the French word for a type of bird called the hoopoe, which has an extravagant crest and a reputation for being dim-witted. (And no, that's not another attempt to dupe you; it's the truth!)"
  },
  "figurative": {
    "short": "When speech or writing is not literal, it is figurative, like when you say you have a ton of homework. You don't really have 2000 pounds of homework, do you? Also, when art depicts a figure from life it is figurative, like a figurative drawing of a dancer.",
    "long": "The adjective figurative comes from the Old French word figuratif, which means “metaphorical.”  Any figure of speech — a statement or phrase not intended to be understood literally — is figurative. You say your hands are frozen, or you are so hungry you could eat a horse. That's being figurative. In art, figure means \"human or animal form,\" so a figurative drawing might show horses running across a field."

  "hallmark": {
    "short": "A hallmark is a distinctive characteristic of something or someone. That can mean a literal symbol on the bottom of a piece of pottery, or just a rock star's signature hair style.",
    "long": "Though some products have real hallmarks on them, indicating their creator or origin, this word is usually used in a less literal way to describe a unique attribute, a special style, or typical feature. A basketball player could say that coming to practice early is a hallmark of her success. A business could say their success is a hallmark of their commitment to customers. And you could definitely say Elvis' hip swivel was a hallmark of his performances."
  },
  "unanimous": {
    "short": "When a group or a decision is unanimous, it means that everyone is in total agreement. Just imagine if you let third graders vote on what to serve at lunch: Pizza and candy would be the unanimous choice!",
    "long": "The adjective unanimous comes from the similar Latin word unanimus, which means “of one mind.” So when people think unanimously, they all have the same idea in their heads. A vote is unanimous when all voters are in agreement. Said Marcus Cicero, “Great is the power, great is the authority of a senate that is unanimous in its opinions.”"
  },
  "adherent": {
    "short": "Because an adherent is usually something or someone that sticks to something or someone else, it's logical that it can also mean a person who believes in and supports a certain philosophy or leader.",
    "long": "An adherent to a cause can be called a disciple, one who believes and tries to get others to believe. It can also refer to a material that sticks to other things.  While the first meaning comes from the 15th century, the reference to a sticky substance didn't emerge until the 16th. In all cases, the word comes from the Latin root haerēre \"stick,\" connected to the prefix ad- \"to,\" making the word mean \"to stick to.\""
  },
  "eclectic": {
    "short": "She listens to hip-hop, Gregorian chant, and folk music from the '60s. He's been seen wearing a handmade tuxedo jacket over a thrift-store flannel shirt. They both have eclectic tastes.",
    "long": "The English word eclectic first appeared in the seventeenth century to describe philosophers who did not belong to a particular school of thought, but instead assembled their doctrines by picking and choosing from a variety of philosophical systems. Today, the word can refer to any assemblage of varied parts. You can have an eclectic group of friends (friends from diverse groups), eclectic taste in furniture (a mixture of 18th-century French chairs, Andy Warhol paintings, and Persian rugs), or enjoy eclectic cuisine (fusion cooking that uses ingredients from different national cuisines)."
  },
  "entrenched": {
    "short": "When you're entrenched, you're dug in. Sometimes that means you're literally in a trench, but usually it means you just won't budge from a position or belief.",
    "long": "Entrenched things are buried so solidly that they can't move — or just behave like they're firmly lodged in some deep hole. Usually this word refers to views people hold very strongly. Having turkey on Thanksgiving is a tradition that's entrenched in American culture — it's long been established and isn't going anywhere. When you're entrenched, you're being stubborn or consistent, depending on your view."
  },
  "condolence": {
    "short": "A condolence is an expression of sympathy and sorrow to someone who has suffered a loss, like the letter of condolence you send to a faraway friend who has lost a loved one.",
    "long": "The noun condolence comes from the Late Latin word condole, meaning “to suffer together.” When you offer your condolences to someone who has suffered a loss, you are saying that you share their sadness, that you are there to support and help them. Don't confuse condolence with consolation, which is an attempt to make the person feel better."
  },
  "politic": {
    "short": "If you are politic, you are smooth and diplomatic. You'd probably make a good politician.",
    "long": "Being politic is being polite and agreeable. Screaming and yelling is not politic. Speaking quietly, making apologies, and giving compliments are all politic things to do. When you want something, being politic is the way to go. It can definitely help to remember that politicians are good at getting what they want — they are shrewd and very politic."
  },
  "incongruous": {
    "short": "Something that's incongruous is inconsistent or incompatible with something else. Remember that Sesame Street song \"One of these things is not like the other\"? They were talking about that one thing being incongruous.",
    "long": "If we break it down into its Latin roots, incongruous is formed by adding in, meaning “not,\" to congruous, which means “suitable, proper.” So, something that is incongruous is \"not suitable or proper\" — in other words, not in harmony with everything else. That's why burping at the dinner table could be called incongruous behavior: it's not proper and certainly doesn't go well with the main course."
  },
  "scattered": {
    "short": "When things are scattered, they’re spread out all over the place. If the forecast calls for scattered showers, it’ll rain here and there.",
    "long": "Items lying at random intervals and at some distance from each other can be described as scattered. Your birthday cake might be scattered with sprinkles, and the floor of your little sister's room might be scattered with Lego blocks. Another meaning of scattered is \"messy\" or \"disordered\" — you can describe yourself as scattered if you're feeling disorganized and confused. The word scatter is probably related to shatter, \"break into pieces,\" from a Middle English root."
  },
  "verdict": {
    "short": "A verdict is a decision made after a lot of considering, usually made by the jury in a courtroom. If you've finally decided that the test was unfair, that's your verdict and you should talk to the teacher about it.",
    "long": "Although verdicts are usually announced in a courtroom, any time someone makes a judgment about something, it's a verdict. The truth lies in the root of this word: ver comes from the Latin verus, meaning \"true.\" Ver shows up in other words — to verify something is to prove that it's true, and veracious is an adjective meaning \"truthful.\"\tAnd the truth is exactly what the judge needs when he's trying to decide the verdict of a case."
  },
  "precede": {
    "short": "To precede is to come before. A short speech will precede the dinner. As you walk down the garden path, the bed of roses precedes the holly bush. When marching into the room, the younger kids precede the older ones.",
    "long": "Precede is one of many verbs ending in \"-ceed\" or \"-cede\" that trace their roots back to the Latin word cedere which means \"to go.\" For precede, know that it's pre \"first\" + cedere \"go.\" When you precede, you go first. You might precede your best friend in line, lunch might precede math class, a joke might precede a lecture, and radio preceded television. Anything that goes first or comes before precedes."
  },
  "goad": {
    "short": "A goad is a pointy stick or other instrument used to prod something along. To goad is to poke something with that pointy stick. Either way, the pointiness is really essential for making things leap into action.",
    "long": "Originally spelled gad, meaning “spearhead,” goad first came into use as a verb in the 1570s. But say you left your pointy goading stick at home. Have no fear! You can goad people with words, too. Literally or figuratively, a goad prods and pokes and provokes people into doing something. A sheep herder might hustle his flock along with a goad, just as your mom's constant nagging and goading might finally get you sit up straight at the dinner table."
  },
  "provocation": {
    "short": "A provocation makes someone angry or sometimes even violent. Telling a professional boxer how ugly he is would be considered a provocation — one that might get you punched in the face.",
    "long": "Provocation is the act of provoking someone — doing something just to get a reaction. During election season, opponents sometimes use provocation to try to ruin one another's reputation. However, sometimes it backfires and the one doing the provoking, looking like a bully, loses votes. Some celebrities whose stars are fading use provocation like making scandalous statements to try to keep their names in the headlines."
  },
  "topple": {
    "short": "To topple something is to knock it down. A house of cards can be toppled — so can a government.",
    "long": "Things can topple in several ways. If a building collapses or falls down for any reason, it topples. If you knocked over another student, you toppled that person. Governments that are overthrown are also said to be toppled. When you see the word topple, someone or something is going down."
  },
  "idyllic": {
    "short": "A week at the beach that goes perfectly is an idyllic vacation. Idyllic means so wonderful it seems almost magical.",
    "long": "Are you having an idyllic childhood? You may not think so now, but in your old age, you may remember your days as a youngster as simple and carefree. The clear, blue water of the Caribbean Sea, the beautiful village perched on a cliffside, the sunny grassy field of wildflowers, these are all idylls — simple peaceful scenes — that you may or may not find idyllic."
  },
  "hoax": {
    "short": "If you put on big fake feet, stomp through your muddy backyard and tell everyone you saw Bigfoot fixing a steak on your grill, you are playing a hoax on your friends.",
    "long": "Hoax is believed to be a shortened version of hocus pocus, thus conveying the feeling of trickery and sleight of hand. April First, also known as April Fools' Day, is a day of hoaxes. Successful hoaxes in history: Orson Welles' War-of-the-Worlds radio broadcast in 1938 and the alien autopsy film footage made public in the 1990s. Do you believe the American moon landing in 1969 was a hoax? You're not alone. Six percent of Americans believe this event was staged."
  },
  "consanguinity": {
    "short": "The noun consanguinity means \"relation by blood,\" so if you want to dazzle your brother, point out that consanguinity isn't the only reason you hang out with him — he's also a great guy!",
    "long": "Consanguinity comes from the Latin com- \"together\" and sanguineus \"of blood,\" which itself can be traced back even farther, to the early 14th century when the Old French word sanguin (fem. sanguine) meant \"a type of red cloth.\" So blood gets its name from the vivid red color it matches, and consanguinity describes the people who, as family members, share the same blood."
  },
  "generic": {
    "short": "Generic refers to the members of a whole class of things — like \"tissue,\" a generic word for any soft, thin piece of paper that's good for wiping runny noses.",
    "long": "A generic product, whether it's a tire or donut or drug, is typical of all other products like it. There's nothing distinctive or unique about it. A generic fan looks and acts just like dozens of other fans — it doesn't spin backwards or send out sparks. Generic aspirin doesn't have a trademark, like Bayer or St. Joseph: it's just plain aspirin."

  "juggernaut": {
    "short": "Juggernaut means a massive force. If the army marching into your country is a juggernaut, you're doomed. If you're trying to market a new Cola product, you're up against corporate giant Coca-Cola, a beverage juggernaut if ever there was one.",
    "long": "With its roots in Hindi, juggernaut originally referred to a crude statue from which the Hindu god, Brahma, turned into the living god, Krishna. There continues to be a festival in honor of this miracle, in which a statue of Krishna is carted through town. It is said that in times past, devotees would throw themselves under the cart’s wheels."
  },
  "fever": {
    "short": "A fever happens when the body's internal temperature is higher than normal. If you have a sore throat, a headache, and a fever, you may have the flu.",
    "long": "When you have a fever, your skin may feel hot, and your temperature as measured by a thermometer will be high. A fever can also make you feel achy, tired, and chilly, and it can be a sign that you've got some kind of infection. The Old English is fefor, from a Latin root, febris,  also \"fever.\" Doctors and nurses sometimes refer to a fever as a \"febrile response.\""
  },
  "pious": {
    "short": "If someone is deeply religious and visibly follows all the moral and ethical codes of his religion, he is pious. Don't become a priest if you're not prepared to live a pious life.",
    "long": "Pious comes from the Latin pius, which means dutiful. It doesn't always have to be used to talk about organized religion. If someone believes deeply in something, and lets everyone see it through their behavior, then they are pious, whether they're pious Christians or pious environmentalists.  It differs from its synonym devout, which implies deep religious sentiment, whereas pious emphasizes the public display of feeling."
  },
  "plausible": {
    "short": "If something is plausible, it's reasonable or believable. Things that are plausible could easily happen. A woman becoming President is very plausible. A giraffe becoming President is not.",
    "long": "Plausible things are not far-fetched at all. Things in fantasy stories — such as wizards, dragons, and unicorns — are not plausible. On the other hand, some things in science fiction stories might be plausible: who knows where spaceships will eventually go? If something really seems like it could happen, then it's plausible. One of the many tricky parts of life is figuring out what's plausible and what's not."
  },
  "astringent": {
    "short": "You know that vinegar-like liquid teens put on their faces in order to tighten their pores and dry up their pimples? That's astringent. An astringent personality, on the other hand, is perceived as bitter and perhaps even a bit toxic.",
    "long": "Astringent may be a lifesaver for an acne-prone teen, but when the term is used as an adjective and applied to you personally, it's less positive. Since astringents are acid-based, an astringent personality can also be corrosive. If someone is prone to biting sarcasm and cynicism, he probably has an astringent view of the world."
  },
  "symbiosis": {
    "short": "Symbiosis, a noun, tells about the relationship between living things that helps all of them stay alive, like the symbiosis between bees that eat nectar from flowers that get cross-pollinated when the bees move from one to the next.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce symbiosis, accent the third syllable: \"sim-be-OH-sis.\" The prefix syn comes from the Greek word \"together\" and bios means \"life.\" So symbiosis means \"a living together.\" Things that live in symbiosis depend on one another, like the clown fish and anemone that protect one another from ocean predators, or the symbiosis between a dairy farmer and one who grows hay, trading milk for hay bales that feed the cows."
  },
  "fallow": {
    "short": "Something that is fallow is left unused. If you’re smart but lazy, someone might say you have a fallow mind.",
    "long": "We use the word to talk about any unused resource, it started as a work about land. Fallow comes from the old English word for plowing, and refers to the practice of leaving fields unplowed in rotation — when a field lies fallow, the soil regains nutrients that are sucked up by over-planting."

  },
  "dismiss": {
    "short": "At the end of a lesson period, your teacher says, \"class dismissed.\" This means that you and the rest of the students are free to go.",
    "long": "Dismiss means to let go. If a judge dismisses a case, it means he's saying it has no merit, and is throwing it out of court. If you are dismissed from your job, it means you've been fired. And if you've been ignoring your friends' warnings that your boyfriend is cheating, you've been dismissing their concerns. \"Don't dismiss me!\" is something you say when the person you're talking to is not taking you and your comments seriously."
  },
  "fastidious": {
    "short": "If you want to describe a person who insists on perfection or pays much attention to food, clothing and cleanliness, the right word is fastidious.",
    "long": "Fastidious is a funny-sounding adjective from the Latin fastidium \"loathing\" that has several equally strange-sounding synonyms — persnickety, fussbudgety, finicky and punctilious. Fussy and hard to please will also do the trick. Fastidious is occasionally used as a compliment to describe someone whose attention to detail gives them good organizing abilities, but it is usually used as a disapproving term."
  },
  "cognizance": {
    "short": "When you have cognizance, you have knowledge of something. Your cognizance of the English language is growing with every new vocabulary word you learn. Just don't flaunt your cognizance too much, or your friends might call you a know-it-all.",
    "long": "Cognizance can be used to refer to more than just school-based learning (like vocabulary words). It can also mean that you have awareness or notice certain things. Your cognizance of where the exits are located in the movie theater could save your life in a fire. The noun cognizance can also refer to your state of consciousness: \"You passed out from the smoke, but when you woke up you had the cognizance to know who you were and where you were.\""
  },
  "benediction": {
    "short": "A benediction is a blessing — either a formal one that you might hear in a church service or an informal one that you might utter when you take any leap of faith.",
    "long": "The noun benediction comes from the Latin roots bene, meaning \"well\" and diction meaning \"to speak\" — literally to speak well of. Although it is most often used in the religious sense of prayer and blessing — especially a ceremonial prayer at the end of a church service — it can mean any expression of good wishes. \"Good luck on the test!\" the mother cried in benediction as her son set off for school."
  },
  "elliptical": {
    "short": "The word elliptical is derived from the oval shape known as an ellipse. Many comets have an elliptical orbit around the Sun that brings them closer at some times and farther away at others.",
    "long": "The adjective elliptical refers to the shape of an ellipse, which is an elongated circle, stretched into an oval. This word can also be used to describe a way of speaking that cuts out extra, unnecessary language. When writers use an elliptical style, it sometimes makes the work obscure and hard to interpret."
  },
  "sacrilegious": {
    "short": "Sacrilegious means extremely disrespectful towards something considered sacred. An action that causes deep offense to a believer — like burning a religious text, for example — is sacrilegious.",
    "long": "The Latin sacrilegus, \"thief of sacred things,\" was used to describe robbers who plundered graves and temples. Anything that's sacrilegious is essentially as disrespectful as a graverobber towards things that others find holy or solemn and serious. In modern ironic usage, a sacrilegious opinion runs contrary to popular wisdom or deeply held beliefs. Calling the movie Citizen Kane boring and self-indulgent is totally sacrilegious to many movie lovers."
  },
  "vexation": {
    "short": "Vexation is both something that causes annoyance and the state of mind that results from being annoyed. The test-taker next to you tapping her pencil is a vexation. You breaking her pencil in half makes her feel vexation.",
    "long": "Vexation can also refer to something that causes anxiety and worry more than annoyance. When the parents of the kid you're babysitting are two hours late to return and aren’t answering their phones, that could be a vexation. You are less annoyed than worried. (Though, to be honest, you're still a little annoyed)."
  },
  "epitome": {
    "short": "If you're talking about a typical example of something, call it the epitome. The cartoon character Garfield is the epitome of the lazy, food-obsessed cat.",
    "long": "Coming to us from Greek through Latin, epitome refers to something that is the ultimate representative of its class. Are you the epitome of the hard-working student or do you believe in study in moderation? Make sure you pronounce epitome with the accent on the second syllable (uh-PIH-tuh-mee)."
  },
  "dialogue": {
    "short": "If you land a role in a local play, you will probably have to memorize several lines of dialogue.  If you disagree with how that play is being produced, you may want to open up a dialogue with the director.",
    "long": "Dialogue can refer to spoken lines in a dramatic performance such as a play, a film, or a television show. It is also any conversation between two or more people. On the written page, dialogue between characters is usually enclosed by quotation marks. When persons representing different political parties or different nations are said to engage in a dialogue, it means they are probably negotiating something of importance."
  },
  "supposition": {
    "short": "A supposition is a guess or a hypothesis. Your supposition that your kids will automatically wash their hands before dinner is probably false. You'd best remind them to do it or risk dirty hands at dinner.",
    "long": "What's the difference between an assumption and a supposition — both nouns that are often taken as synonyms for each other? An assumption is an idea or theory that is usually made without proof. A supposition, on the other hand, has the connotation that the idea or theory is testable and provable. If you are to meet someone named Hunter, you may make the assumption that you are meeting a man. But if you know that Hunter lives in an all-female dorm, you may have the supposition that Hunter is a woman."

  "turmoil": {
    "short": "Mashed potatoes flew in one direction, peas in another. Kids were standing on chairs. The principal was shouting, but no one listened. \"Food fight!\" the seniors cried. The cafeteria was in a state of turmoil.",
    "long": "Turmoil rhymes with boil — think of the way that boiling water moves, and you'll understand what turmoil looks like. It refers to confusion, chaos, violent disturbance. The economy can be in turmoil — the markets behaving erratically, people losing their jobs, and no one understanding why."
  },
  "cessation": {
    "short": "Cessation is an end to something, such as the stopping of a bad habit, like the cessation of smoking.",
    "long": "Cessation and cease sound alike and have similar meanings because they both come from the Latin word cessare, which means \"to delay, to stop.\"  The cessation can be permanent, such as when the protests resulted in the cessation of the use of baby bunnies to test lipsticks (forever ending the bunny torture); or temporary, such as the cessation of the rain during the storm that let us run to the car without getting wet (but rain, like sunshine, always comes back)."
  },
  "mediate": {
    "short": "If your two best friends aren't speaking to each other, you might find yourself trying to mediate a peace accord between them. To mediate is to go from one to another and try to make peace.",
    "long": "Mediate derives from the Latin medius \"middle,\" and people who mediate are in the middle, between the parties. Other things that are in the middle can be said to mediate as well. Your mind can mediate between your two conflicting personalities."
  },
  "eloquence": {
    "short": "Eloquence is powerful, moving, magnificent use of language. Simply put, if you have eloquence, then you're one smooth talker.",
    "long": "The noun eloquence has roots in the Latin word eloqui, meaning to \"speak out.\" But we're not talking about just any regular speech here. Eloquence is marked by fluency, persuasiveness, and the power to stir emotions. The eloquence of your dog trainer’s empowering speech about the need for complementary manicures and pedicures for pets might bring you to tears, for example."
  },
  "metamorphose": {
    "short": "If you've ever seen a caterpillar emerge from its cocoon transformed into a butterfly, you've watched it metamorphose, or change completely.",
    "long": "Use the verb metamorphose to describe a total transformation, like an egg into a bird or a seed into a tomato plant. When someone or something changes in appearance, they also metamorphose, the way a messy kid does when he tucks in his shirt and combs his hair. The origins of the word metamorphose lie in the Greek meta, or \"change,\" and morphe, \"form.\""
  },
  "piquant": {
    "short": "Feeling a little saucy? Perhaps a bit provocative — but in a good way? Then it's safe to say your personality is a little piquant.",
    "long": "Coming to us from the French word piquer, which means \"to prick,\" something that's piquant certainly piques your interest. Someone who's piquant engages you with charm and wit. A story that's filled with piquant details has plenty of juicy, provocative points. And grandma's homemade gravy? It's certainly zesty and piquant, even with all the lumps."

If someone has read every single book about pyramids, you might say he has an infinite knowledge of ancient Egyptian culture, even though that's an exaggeration. Surely he'll stop talking about them at some point...right?"

  "expedient": {
    "short": "The adjective expedient describes something that provides an easy way to achieve a goal or result, but it's not necessarily a moral solution.",
    "long": "Politically expedient means something you do to advance yourself politically. Use expedient when you want to hint that a particular solution or strategy has certain benefits and advantages but is not completely fair. However, expedient can also be used as a noun to describe something practical for a particular purpose."

  "concise": {
    "short": "If something is concise, it's short and gets right to the point. A concise edition of your diary might be 50 pages of the most important entries.",
    "long": "Concise comes from the Latin word concidere, which means to cut down. When we use concise, we're talking about words that have been cut down. There are no concise trees, but there are concise works of political philosophy. A concise Italian-English dictionary, is shorter than an unabridged one. If you're good at quick explanations, you have a concise manner.  A good synonym is succinct."
  },
  "donate": {
    "short": "To donate means to give something — money, goods, or time — to some cause, such as a charity. The word has a more altruistic meaning than does simply \"giving\"; it suggests that you don't expect anything in return for the contribution.",
    "long": "The verb donate has always meant \"to give,\" all the way back to the Latin verb donāre, \"to give as a gift.\" Trace it back even further, to the ancient Indo-European roots, and you still have that same feeling to the word — \"a gift.\" But it's more than a gift — it's a gift with the intention of helping. As an African proverb says, \"If everybody in town donates one thread, the poor man has a shirt.\""

    "long": "While prevaricate basically means to lie, it also has the sense of making it hard to know exactly what the lie was. You talk in a confusing way, go back and forth, and as deliberately as possible mislead someone. Government officials, bureaucrats, and sneaky types prevaricate in the hopes that it will be too difficult to figure out whether they've been doing something wrong.

Pale is also a verb that means \"to become pale,\" so you could say that you saw your friend's face pale at the news that her favorite bakery had gone out of business.

If you're tired of being told how similar you are to your long-haired, friendly mother, you could cut your hair.  Or start being rude.

  "gorge": {
    "short": "A gorge is a very deep crevice between two mountains or hills. Gorges are formed by rivers running through and eroding rock over a very long period of time.",
    "long": "The Latin root of gorge means \"throat,\" leading to both the \"narrow passage\" meaning and the French gorgier, \"to swallow,\" which influenced the verb version of gorge, \"to overeat.\" You may love to gorge on ice cream, but the stomachache afterward won't be very pleasant. To remember the \"canyon\" meaning, think of the famous upstate New York bumper sticker, “Ithaca is gorges.” It's a play on gorgeous, meaning beautiful, and the beautiful ravines in the area."

    "short": "If you're a loafer, you avoid working whenever possible, preferring to lounge around relaxing instead. And, if you're too lazy to tie your own shoes, you may prefer to wear loafers — slip-on shoes without laces.",
    "long": "If you're a loafer at work, your co-workers will grow to resent you for doing nothing while they do their jobs. Loafers like to loaf, or \"spend time in an idle, aimless way.\" People will call you a loafer if you spend most of your time in a reclining position, take frequent breaks for snacks and naps, or obviously avoid anything resembling hard work. This noun has been in use since the mid-1800s, but its origin isn't clear. The shoe called a loafer got its name because it's easily slipped on, without the work of laces and knots."

  "anneal": {
    "short": "When you anneal metal or glass, you heat it and then cool it in order to make it less brittle and more malleable.",
    "long": "Metallurgists — engineers who specialize in the properties and uses of metals — have to know a variety of methods used to anneal different kinds of metals. You can also anneal glass, to make it stronger and to help keep it from shattering."
  },
  "delimit": {
    "short": "When you set the boundaries of something, you delimit it. Suburban homeowners often delimit their property lines with tall privacy fences.",
    "long": "You can literally delimit something, the way you might delimit the boundaries of your airplane seat by planting your elbow on the armrest. There is also a figurative way to delimit, like when you delimit your summer schedule in an attempt to keep your cousin from visiting you for a month. Delimit comes from the Latin delimitare, \"to mark out as a boundary.\""
  },
  "evaporate": {
    "short": "To evaporate is to fade away or to literally turn into vapor. If you leave a glass of water out and the water slowly disappears, it's not being consumed by elves; it's evaporating.",
    "long": "People often use the word evaporate metaphorically because it produces a strong image of something disappearing like vapor. When the economy goes through a rough patch, funding for projects like education and the arts tends to evaporate or disappear. Your feelings for a mate might evaporate after you spend too much time with him or her."
  },
  "counterpart": {
    "short": "If you leap tall buildings in a single bound for the Des Moines branch of your corporation, then your Metropolis counterpart might be Superman. That means you and Superman do similar jobs, but in different locations.",
    "long": "The noun counterpart comes from the French word countre part, meaning “duplicate of a legal document.” In legal circles counterpart still means \"a duplicate document,\" but today it is more likely to describe people. Counterparts aren't duplicates, of course, but they have similar skills and responsibilities. If you play soccer, your counterpart is the player on the other team who plays the same position."
  },
  "enfranchise": {
    "short": "The verb enfranchise is used when a group of people are given voting rights or freedoms they didn't have before. Many people under the age of 18 would like lawmakers to enfranchise their peer group so they can vote.",
    "long": "Enfranchise traces back to the Old French word enfranchiss, a combination of en-, meaning \"make, put in,\" and enfranchir, meaning \"to set or make free.\" In the 1680s, enfranchise came to mean \"to admit to membership in a state,\" something that usually came with the right to vote. You may know the word disenfranchised, an adjective that describes people who lack rights or liberties. To enfranchise is to give or restore rights to the disenfranchised."
  },
  "abstruse": {
    "short": "Abstruse things are difficult to understand because they are so deep and intellectually challenging. It might be hard to figure out how a toilet flushes but the technology that goes into making the Internet function is abstruse.",
    "long": "The Latin roots of the word abstruse are about concealing or hiding something, which is a good way to remember the meaning of this word. It is useful when describing something that is overly confusing, or if someone is deliberately making a story or a situation more complicated than necessary. It sounds and looks like obtuse, but abstruse is almost its opposite. Obtuse is dull or lacking a sharpness of intellect. While Abstruse is president of the chess club, Obtuse is hanging out by the parking lot smoking cigarettes."

  "versatile": {
    "short": "To describe a person or thing that can adapt to do many things or serve many functions, consider the adjective versatile.",
    "long": "In E.B. White's classic children's book Charlotte's Web, Charlotte the spider tells Wilbur the pig that she is versatile. \"What does 'versatile' mean — full of eggs?\" Wilbur asks. \"Certainly not,\" Charlotte replies. \"'Versatile' means I can turn with ease from one thing to another.\" Charlotte knew her etymology, because the word reflects its Latin root, versatilis, \"turning around; revolving.\" It eventually came to describe someone who is multi-talented: a singer-songwriter-actress-model would be a versatile figure in the entertainment world."
  },
  "miscreant": {
    "short": "A miscreant is a person who behaves badly — who lies, breaks the law, yells at puppies. It's a somewhat old-fashioned word, popular with old ladies shocked at having their purses stolen at the opera.",
    "long": "Words like miscreant, scoundrel, and good-for-nothing are used to condemn people believed to be improper or even evil. If your mom warns you that your friends are a bunch of miscreants, she's concerned that you're hanging out with the wrong kind of crowd and that you might be headed for trouble."

  "concord": {
    "short": "A concord is an agreement. If you want to watch a romantic comedy and your date wants to watch a horror film, you might compromise and come to a concord by agreeing to watch an action comedy.",
    "long": "Concord can be used as a verb meaning \"to arrange by agreement,\" but this usage is rare. Much more common is concord used as a noun. The United Nations could work tirelessly to establish a concord between warring nations, or you might even work to establish a concord among the warring factions on your cheerleading team. A concord brings peace and harmony — just like a peace treaty."
  },
  "abeyance": {
    "short": "An abeyance is a temporary halt to something, with the emphasis on \"temporary.\" It is usually used with the word \"in\" or \"into\"; \"in abeyance\" suggests a state of waiting or holding.",
    "long": "The word abeyance has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason — appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word abeiance, a legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property. Nowadays, the word is used in a similar way. Different legal rights, like property rights, can be held in abeyance until matters are resolved."
  },
  "predecessor": {
    "short": "A predecessor is something that came before the current version. The person you replaced at work is your predecessor, just like Pac Man is the predecessor of modern video games.",
    "long": "If you break the word predecessor down to its Latin roots, you get pre, meaning \"beforehand,\" and decessor, which means \"retiring officer.\" So that's how we get to our definition of \"someone who has held an office or position before the present holder.\" But predecessors aren't just found in the business world: these days predecessors include our ancestors, earlier car models, and all kinds of other forerunners."

  "vigor": {
    "short": "If your new puppy runs all over the house, jumps on the furniture, and enthusiastically chews up your socks,  you may congratulate yourself on your new pup's vigor, or lively sense of energy.",
    "long": "Aside from mental or physical vitality, the noun vigor can be applied to an imaginative style of thought or expression and also to a forceful intensity. \"The jury was not only willing to acquit the defendant, but also nominate him for sainthood, by the time his attorney had delivered, with vigor, an impassioned plea for his client's innocence.\""

  "demotic": {
    "short": "A demotic saying or expression is casual, colloquial, and used by the masses. Some forms of the Greek and Egyptian languages are also called demotic, which will be relevant to you when you get your PhD in Classics.",
    "long": "Demotic comes from the Greek word demotikos, meaning “of or for the common people” or “in common use.” Members of the aristocracy don’t typically use demotic idioms, but it is often the elite who will point out that something is demotic. Of course, in a classless society, everything ought to be demotic, therefore making it obsolete to designate sayings as demotic. So far, however, demotic is still a relevant term."
  },
  "tactless": {
    "short": "To be tactless is to either be rude (without manners) or inept (without finesse). Either way, it's awkward.",
    "long": "Since people with tact are polite and respectful, tactless people are the opposite: rude and ill-mannered. Interrupting is tactless. Wearing a baseball hat in church is tactless. Not holding the door for someone is tactless. This word has to do with other graces besides social graces too. Being clumsy or lacking in judgment can also be called tactless, and an employee who constantly botches his job and never understands why is also tactless."
  },
  "revenge": {
    "short": "Someone seeking revenge is looking to retaliate for a wrong that has been done.",
    "long": "Sometimes a word can be used as either a noun or a verb, without changing the spelling. That's the case with revenge. You can take revenge (noun) on someone who hurt you, or you can revenge (verb) the hurt, punishing the person who wronged you. While revenge may be sweet, it usually just leads to more revenge from the other side, and so on. While that makes a good Shakespeare play, it can get pretty wearing in real life."

  "toxic": {
    "short": "Danger! Hazardous! Do not eat! These are just some of the warnings you'll see on toxic substances — meaning stuff that's poisonous and even deadly.",
    "long": "Cobra bites, wild mystery mushrooms and strong chemicals are all toxic. So are certain people, if they have particularly mean personalities. Toxic is related to the word toxin, which is a kind of poison. It comes from the ancient Greek word toxikon, which means \"poison for arrows.\" Some toxic arrows could come in handy for those toxic personalities..."
  },
  "occult": {
    "short": "Dark and mysterious, the occult is a kind of supernatural power or magic. If you see your neighbor chanting over a giant vat of bubbling brew in the middle of the night, there's a chance he's dabbling in the occult.",
    "long": "The word occult has its roots in the Latin occultus, meaning “hidden, secret.” That's why it can also be used as both a noun referring to black magic and an adjective meaning \"difficult to see.\" Quipped the famous physicist Heinz Pagels, “I like to browse in occult bookshops if for no other reason than to refresh my commitment to science.”"

  "impregnable": {
    "short": "When something is impregnable it is not easily taken by force and can stand up to any attack. We usually use it in reference to some form of protection, like a fort or a solid defensive line in football.",
    "long": "The genealogy of the adjective impregnable includes the Middle French word prenable, meaning \"vulnerable, easily conquered,\" which itself came from the verb prendre, which meant \"to take.\" The addition of the negative prefix im- flipped the meaning. Impregnable can be used to describe anything that cannot be entered or successfully attacked. Seventeenth-century theater critic Jeremy Collier once said, \"True courage is a result of reasoning. A brave mind is always impregnable.\""
  },
  "equivocation": {
    "short": "If your boss asks you where all the merchandise went and you say, \"someone took it,\" omitting that the \"someone\" in question is you, that's  equivocation: using ambiguous language to hide the truth.",
    "long": "Equivocation comes from the Latin for \"equal\" and \"naming,\" and in equivocation, you use a word that could have a few different meanings, all technically equal, in order to mask what you really mean. It's a great way to not-quite lie, but still avoid taking the blame for something you did, which is why equivocation is never a good thing. You may recognize this kind of speech from watching (some) politicians on TV."
  },
  "despot": {
    "short": "A despot, is a cruel, all-controlling ruler. For example, a despot does not allow people to speak out against the leadership, nor really want them to have much freedom at all.",
    "long": "The word despot came into English in the sixteenth century from Old French, but it traces all the way back to the Greek word despotes, meaning \"master of a household, lord, absolute ruler.\" The word is often used to describe someone who abuses power and oppresses others. Obviously, it's not a nice thing to call someone, especially within earshot of the despot who has absolute power over you."
  },
  "parsimonious": {
    "short": "A parsimonious person is unwilling to spend a lot of money. You know those people who count up every penny when it's time to split a restaurant bill? You can call them parsimonious. Or cheap.",
    "long": "Stingy is the most common and general synonym of parsimonious, but there are many other near synonyms, including thrifty, frugal, penurious, niggardly, penny-pinching, miserly, tight-fisted, tight. The adjective parsimonious was formed in English from the noun parsimony, \"the quality of being careful in spending.\" It is a combination of the Latin verb parcere, \"to spare,\" plus an Old French suffix –ous, \"having the quality of.\""
  },
  "coincide": {
    "short": "When things happen at the same time, they are said to coincide. Often, this is because they're intentionally coordinated — \"the bake sale coincided with Parent Day\" — but not always.",
    "long": "Coincide can also mean happen together in other ways. \"My mother's views on appropriate teen fashion do not always coincide with mine\" is a tactful way to say she hates your clothes. You could also describe two roads coming together as coinciding — though it's more poetic to talk about when they diverge."
  },
  "flame": {
    "short": "The flame of a fire produces light and heat and often flickers or dances. As a verb, to flame is to be on fire or to flare up.",
    "long": "On the Internet, flame has a different meaning: to post or send aggressive, negative, or insulting messages in a public electronic forum. \"Flame wars\" are exchanges of such messages between individuals or parties and often occur behind a veil of anonymity. It's an appropriate term, given that inflammatory, which takes flame as its root, describes speech or action that tends to incite a heightened and negative response."
  },
  "callous": {
    "short": "A callous person is insensitive or emotionally hardened. If you laugh at your little sister while she's trying to show you her poetry, you're being callous.",
    "long": "Callous comes from the Latin root callum for hard skin.  If you walk barefoot a lot, your feet will become calloused. We often use callous, as an adjective or a verb, in the metaphorical sense for emotionally hardened. If someone is unmoved by other people's problems, you might say he shows a callous indifference to human suffering or that his heart has been calloused by his own problems."
  },
  "compendium": {
    "short": "When you search an online encyclopedia, you are searching a compendium of information on just about everything. A compendium is a comprehensive collection of something.",
    "long": "You can also use the word compendium to describe a collection of written works. If you gather all of the anecdotes your parents and grandparents have told you into a book, you'll have created a compendium of family stories. The plural of compendium is either compendiums or compendia."

  "auxiliary": {
    "short": "When you're offering something in support of an already existing thing, you're offering something auxiliary. The auxiliary police will help out the regular police with things like directing traffic and crowd control when there's a special event in town.",
    "long": "The Latin word auxilium means \"help,\" and so auxiliary means something that \"helps\" by providing backup or support. Think of auxiliary verbs (sometimes called helper verbs), that provide support within a verb phrase, as \"is\" does in \"Helen is playing.\" You can have an auxiliary engine in a car, an auxiliary cook at a restaurant, an auxiliary electrical network at a factory, or auxiliary troops standing by during battle. A \"Ladies Auxiliary\" functions as support for institutions such as churches, synagogues, or charities."

  "pan": {
    "short": "A pan can be a cooking utensil, a negative opinion, or a sweeping camera shot. You cook eggs in a pan, but as a film critic you might pan a new docudrama for poor editing and overuse of pan shots.",
    "long": "A pan is a shallow metal object that you use to cook food. It can also be a verb indicating you're expressing a negative view. To pan a performance, book, or movie is to say that you think it stunk. If all the critics pan something, sales usually go down, but not always. To pan a film or video camera is to move it from left to right or right to left in a smooth motion."

  "squelch": {
    "short": "When you squelch something, you're putting an end to it. You can squelch an idea or a rebellion.",
    "long": "This word has several meanings, but it's usually a verb for crushing things. A mean remark could squelch your self-confidence, and a powerful military could squelch an invading country. Squelching can also mean to make a squelch-like sucking sound — or to slop, slosh, splash, and squish through the mud. There's also a type of electric circuit that cuts off when the signal is weak: that's a squelch circuit, which squelches the connection."

  "conventional": {
    "short": "Conventional is an adjective for things that are normal, ordinary, and following the accepted way. Ho-hum.",
    "long": "This word describes what is typical and ordinary and that which follows accepted standards of behavior or taste. This is a word that's current definition is still very similar to its Latin root, conventionalis, which is \"pertaining to an agreement.\" One way this word is used is with respect to conventional weapons, as in those \"not using, making, or involving nuclear weapons or energy; nonnuclear.\""

  "jettison": {
    "short": "Jettison means to push to the side or toss away. If a boat is leaking or an airplane is running out of fuel, you can buy more time by jettisoning cargo, or throwing it overboard.",
    "long": "The word jettison — dating, in its nautical meaning, from the 15th century in English — is commonly used figuratively as well as literally. You can jettison a friendship or an attitude. During the month that the Winter Olympics are aired on TV, figure-skating fans across the country jettison homework and other responsibilities in order to watch."
  },
  "odorous": {
    "short": "Anything that has a strong scent can be described as odorous. Usually if you say something is odorous you mean that it smells unpleasant — like an odorous blue cheese made from unpasteurized milk.",
    "long": "The adjective odorous comes from the Latin odorus, meaning “fragrant.” Typically, you wouldn’t say, “those roses you sent me are so odorous!” Although that comment could be literally correct, the implication would be insulting to the giver of said roses. More common uses of odorous might include: odorous gym mats, odorous garbage can, odorous gas fumes — you get the picture. Or rather the stench."
  },
  "debauchery": {
    "short": "Debauchery is a noun meaning crazy partying and wild nights, usually accompanied by a lot of alcohol. So you probably don't want to engage in any kind of debauchery the night before an exam.",
    "long": "Debauchery is all about indulging in some of life's pleasures — overindulging, in fact. It stems from the Middle French word debaucher, which means to “entice from work or duty.” So imagine workers being tempted from another day at the office by the promise of a wild bender in Vegas. Or college kids putting down the books and heeding the siren call of the frat party downstairs."
  },
  "exult": {
    "short": "Sometimes you might feel so happy about something you could just burst. This is the time to exult, or rejoice, and you might show your great happiness by laughing, dancing, and shouting with pure joy.",
    "long": "To exult means to express your joy in some visible way. Some people exult in a sedate manner, maybe just enjoying their happiness quietly within themselves. Others are more emotional, perhaps expressing their triumph in a loud or physical manner. When you break the word down into its Latin parts, the ex- means \"out,\" and saltāre means \"to leap.\" So exult means to leap with joy."

  "infamous": {
    "short": "Someone who is infamous has a very bad reputation. If you become a Hollywood star and find yourself on the pages of gossip magazines for your affairs and addictions, you will have succeeded in becoming infamous.",
    "long": "Infamous is from Latin infamis, for negative fame. If you're bad but unknown, then you're not infamous — it's reserved for those wicked and well-known people that capture our collective imagination.  It is a strong and resonant term. Some synonyms are notorious, disgraceful, and odious. The stress is on the first syllable."

  "alienation": {
    "short": "An easy way to experience alienation from your nice-smelling friends is to go a month without bathing. Alienation is a state of being cut off or separate from a person or group of people.",
    "long": "The noun alienation describes the feeling that you're not part of a group. Your political views might cause you to feel a sense of alienation from the rest of your family, or your vegetarianism could result in alienation from your meat-eating friends. The Latin word for alien is alienus, \"belonging to another.\" That idea of not belonging, or not fitting in, gave rise to the Latin verb alienare, \"to estrange,\" which alienation comes from."
  },
  "inalienable": {
    "short": "Something that is yours forever, that can’t be taken away and given to your little brother instead? That  something would be called inalienable. The word refers to a natural right that cannot be revoked by an outside force.",
    "long": "The word inalienable is often linked to human rights — you’ve probably heard the term “inalienable rights.” In the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson (using the un- variant) wrote that all men are \"endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights\" including \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” The spelling may vary but the meaning is clear: an inalienable right is something that can’t be given or taken away by a government or another legal power."

  "contrite": {
    "short": "We are sorry to inform you that the adjective contrite means regretful, remorseful, or even guilty.",
    "long": "Someone who feels remorse or guilt is contrite and in addition to feeling sorry, part of the definition includes wanting to atone for having done something wrong. The word comes from the Latin roots com- meaning \"together\" and terere which means \"to rub.\" It's also related to the Latin word conterere and is defined as \"to bruise.\" In the field of theology being contrite is \"being remorseful for past sin and resolved to avoid future sin.\""

    "long": "A kid sister, a mosquito, an angry boyfriend, or a hot, muggy day: all of these are examples of things that might nettle a person. When you nettle someone, you act like a nettle; you annoy, bother, and generally tick off a person. The person who nettles you can be called nettlesome, which means that they're acting like a nettle. I find that the very sound of his voice nettles me. The sound alone makes me wish he would just shut up."

    "long": "The corresponding adjective is candid, as in \"I want you to be candid. Did everyone notice the spinach between my teeth when I gave my speech?\" Candor is from French candeur, from Latin candēre, \"to shine or be white.\" The color white is associated with purity, which is a now obsolete meaning of candor."

  "negate": {
    "short": "If something neutralizes the effect of something else, then you can say the effect is negated. Hanging a disco ball from your living room ceiling negates the sleek modern effect created by the contemporary furniture.",
    "long": "If something is proved false or untrue, it has been negated. The discovery of one dinosaur jaw negated the conventional wisdom that all dinosaurs were vegetarians, since the tooth structure proved that guy definitely ate meat. The verb negate can also mean to counteract or counterbalance — so a really strong serve can negate your other weaknesses on the tennis court."
  },
  "dross": {
    "short": "Things that are a total loss — really worthless or damaging — are dross. That gunk between your teeth that comes out when you floss? You could call that dross. No one wants it, and it's harmful if it stays.",
    "long": "While dross is a noun for stuff that's physically left over or useless, like the nonmetallic stuff left when metal gets refined, it's also used for people and forms of art. A really bad movie can be called dross, and a low or despicable person can be dross. Debris, or trash, is another form of dross. \"Searching the backyard for unexploded fireworks — the dross of Chinese New Year celebrations — was a tradition for the kids and a safeguard for the dogs.\""

    "long": "Castigate means punish, and punish harshly, but the punishment is always a severe scolding. Sometimes it means criticize severely. Politicians in the Senate are always castigating each other for their alliances and opinions. Castigate and chasten, which also means \"to reprimand\" but is less severe, share the Latin root castus which means \"pure.\" Ideally, if you castigate someone, you mean to guide someone away from the wrong path and toward a more pure one. But it sure doesn't feel like that when you're being castigated!"

  "divulge": {
    "short": "If you've been sneaking around with your best friend's boyfriend, that's probably one secret you don't want to divulge, because revealing that tidbit of information will probably cut your friendship short.",
    "long": "Divulge often precedes the word secret, because it means to reveal something, and that something is often of a personal or private nature. A gossip columnist's job is to divulge which celebrities are secretly dating and which ones have been caught in embarrassing situations. Although the word comes from the Latin word for making something public to the masses, it can also be used to describe information passed from one person to another. For example, a mother could divulge to her daughter that she was adopted."

    "long": "Having the mettle to do something means you have guts. In short, you're a pretty impressive person. If you have the intellectual mettle to enter a political debate, not only do you know a lot about politics, but you have the spunk to show it off. Metal and mettle were once used interchangeably meaning a solid material like gold and the \"stuff a person is made of\" — until everyone got confused and the words went their separate ways."

  "descant": {
    "short": "In music, a descant is an additional vocal part above the main melody. Many church hymns include a descant, sung at a higher pitch than the melody. Literary types use descant as a verb to mean \"talk on and on in a dull way.\"",

The medieval Latin term was discantus, \"refrain\" or \"part-song,\" from dis-, \"apart,\" and cantus, \"song or bird-song.\" Through the years, the word has been used for the soprano in a group of singers or the highest-pitched line in any song."

If so, it won’t surprise you to learn that blunder comes from the Old Norse word blundra, meaning to “shut one's eyes.” It wasn’t until the eighteenth century that blunder came to refer to a stupid or embarrassing mistake, or as a verb, to describe making such a mistake, as in “I tend to blunder when I'm nervous.”"

  "multifaceted": {
    "short": "Multifaceted means having many aspects or sides. Diamonds are usually cut to be multifaceted, that is, with many angled flat surfaces, because this increases their ability to reflect light.",
    "long": "Since facet means \"aspect,\" \"side,\" or \"face,\" multifaceted means \"many aspects, sides, or faces.\" This can apply to jewels or other physical objects, like the eyes of a dragonfly, but it can also refer to complicated issues that have lots of contributing factors and generate more than two sides to an argument. A multifaceted person has many abilities, or a personality with many sides to it."

While you could just say passed or even outdid\" saying surpass seems to indicate that a person (or some other thing that performs, like a company) has really gone beyond anything you anticipated. People tend to use this word a lot before the words expectations and predictions among others, because of course surpassing is all about \"surpassing something.\""

  "treacherous": {
    "short": "Treacherous means either not trusted or dangerous. A treacherous road might be icy or otherwise likely to cause a car accident. A treacherous friend will betray you.",
    "long": "Treachery refers to harmful acts you might do to someone who trusts you. It can also refer to being disloyal to your native country, but the word treason is more common in this sense. Treachery is from Middle English trecherie, from Old French, from trichier \"to trick or cheat.\" The English word trick is from trikier, a slightly different spelling that was used in some dialects of Old French."

  "inconsequential": {
    "short": "If something is considered of little worth or importance, it is inconsequential. If astronomers forecast a tremendous meteor shower, it might turn out to be no more than space junk, too inconsequential to record.",
    "long": "You can use the adjective inconsequential to describe things that just don’t matter or are of no relevance, as in \"the rainy forecast is totally inconsequential — the bowling tournament is inside!\" It also describes things that don't make sense in a certain order, \"trying to win their votes is inconsequential: the election's over.\" Something small or minor can be inconsequential too, though the red bump on your nose on picture-day may not seem as inconsequential to you as it does to the photographer."
  },
  "reckless": {
    "short": "If you are reckless, you don't think or care about the consequences of your words or actions, like a reckless driver who speeds while texting, knitting, and eating a sandwich.",
    "long": "The word reckless comes from the Old English word receleas, meaning \"careless, thoughtless, heedless.\" If you have a reckless attitude, you aren't concerned about what happens to yourself or others who are affected by your actions. In this usage, reckless is the opposite of considerate. Reckless friends will invite people you don't know to your house because with your parents away, it's party time. Surprise!"
  },
  "turbid": {
    "short": "If a liquid is dark and murky and you can't see through it, it's turbid.  It’s usually used as a criticism — a turbid river is generally a polluted one, but then again a good pint of real ale should be turbid. Go figure.",
    "long": "Turbid comes from the Latin word turbidus, which means \"muddy, full of confusion.\" Although it’s usually used to describe liquid, like that turbid creek your rain boot disappeared in, it can also be used to describe writing that’s unclear. If your teacher says your essay for English is turbid, it’s time to go back to work! Outlines and thesis statements can help clear up turbid prose."
  },
  "arbiter": {
    "short": "An arbiter is someone selected to judge and settle a dispute.  When Doc and Grumpy disagreed over whose turn it was to stay late at the mine, they chose Snow White as an arbiter.",
    "long": "Arbiter, from the Latin, means \"one who goes somewhere as witness or judge.” The arbiter of a baseball game is called an umpire. In football and basketball, the arbiter is a referee.  Arbitration is a type of conflict resolution in which a neutral person — the arbiter — hears the details of a dispute and makes a legally-binding decision about its resolution."
  },
  "impute": {
    "short": "The verb impute can be used to blame someone for doing something bad, give credit for good work, or just tell it like it is, like when you impute your lateness to my not telling you where to meet me.",
    "long": "When you impute something, you name the cause of something that has happened. For example, you might impute your ability to sing well to the thousands of dollars your parents spent in voice lessons. In other words, you name the source. You can also impute a person, like imputing to a teacher your love of learning — he or she helped you become more interested in school and your classes."
  },
  "stodgy": {
    "short": "The Queen's guards outside Buckingham Palace might seem stodgy (or stuffy and stuck-up), but they are only doing their job.",
    "long": "Stodgy is an adjective to describe anything dull, out-of-style, or even hard to digest. Just your luck getting stuck sitting next to stodgy Aunt Irma at Thanksgiving! From the looks of her stodgy moth-smelling clothes to her stodgy or dull conversation, chances are it will be a long meal. Just hope the mashed potatoes are light and fluffy."
  },
  "calumniate": {
    "short": "To calumniate is to make a false accusation against someone or spread lies about how awful they are. Don’t calumniate your rival in the race for class president, because when the truth comes out, you’ll be the bad guy.",
    "long": "The courts would say to calumniate is to slander. Everyone else would just say it’s mean. Calumniate is just a fancier way of saying “lie” — but specifically lying to tarnish someone's reputation. If your sister says you purposely broke a vase and you didn't, she calumniates you. If you get in trouble in class, you could calumniate to the principal about your teacher being a wretched mess — but the other students might speak up and prove you wrong."
  },
  "conundrum": {
    "short": "The tricky word conundrum is used to describe a riddle or puzzle, sometimes including a play on words or pun.",
    "long": "One of the most famous conundrums is the riddle of the Sphinx, famously in the play Oedipus the King by Sophocles. Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a mythical beast, who asks him, \"What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?\" The answer is \"A person\": crawling as a child, walking as an adult, and using a cane in old age. The scary thing is that if the Sphinx asked you the riddle and you didn't know, she'd eat you!"
  },
  "confess": {
    "short": "When you confess, you admit to doing something wrong. You might feel guilty about eating the entire platter of chocolate chip cookies and confess to your mom before she notices. If she presses charges, you would confess to the cookie crime.",
    "long": "Confess can be used to describe admitting to committing a crime. If you watch crime shows on TV, you've likely seen detectives trying to get a suspect to confess. Confess can also be used in a religious context. Catholics confess their sins to a priest on a regular basis. Don't confuse the word confess with apology. An apology involves expressing regret about something. When you confess, you're merely owning up to doing it — you might not be sorry."
  },
  "sycophant": {
    "short": "A sycophant is a person who tries to win favor from wealthy or influential people by flattering them. Also known as brown-nosers, teacher's pets or suck-ups.",
    "long": "Sycophant is from Latin sycophanta, from Greek sykophantēs, from sykon \"fig\" and phainein \"to show, make known.\" The original sense was that of an informer, a person who gives information about criminal activities. \"Showing the fig\" was a vulgar gesture made by sticking the thumb between two fingers. The gesture was used to taunt an opponent or to make an accusation against someone."
  },
  "rococo": {
    "short": "Rococo describes a very ornate style originating in Europe. If you love tons of decoration and fancy details, then you'll love the rococo style of architecture and music.",
    "long": "Modern design is all simplicity: clean lines and no clutter. Rococo design — which came and went in Europe in the 1700s — is the opposite: it explodes with detail, ornament, patterns, and decoration. If something other than an actual work of design or music is described as rococo, it means wildly detailed, to the point of excess. They sat me next to Diana, who told me the whole rococo story of her divorce. Hours had passed before she even got to the part about the affair."
  },
  "crave": {
    "short": "To crave something is to have a great desire for it, as one might crave love, fame, or French fries.",
    "long": "Crave is typically used in the context of emotional or physical desires rather than practical needs. For example, most people crave a hug or a cup of hot cocoa every now and then, but it’s unusual to crave a new filing cabinet or tie rack — although if that’s how you feel, don’t let us interfere. Interestingly, crave comes from an Old English word meaning “demand.” Perhaps our ancestors were more assertive about getting what they wanted."
  },
  "orientation": {
    "short": "Orientation is all about the direction you're facing. A house can have an east-facing orientation. Freshman orientation starts you off in a good direction. Your political orientation means your political outlook.",
    "long": "Orientation is a relatively new word that was derived in the 19th century from orient, which means to point yourself in a specific direction. Hiking with a map and a compass is sometimes called orienteering, referring to hikers' use of those tools to orient themselves."
  },
  "bounteous": {
    "short": "Things that are bounteous are plentiful and generously given. Your friends might celebrate your birthday by bringing you a bounteous armful of flowers.",
    "long": "Farmers planting their crops in the spring hope for a bounteous harvest in the summer, and the very best elementary school teachers have bounteous amounts of affection for children. Bounteous things are found in great abundance. The word's original, fourteenth century meaning was \"full of goodness,\" from the noun bounty, or \"generosity.\" The Latin root is bonitatem, or \"goodness.\""
  },
  "collaborate": {
    "short": "When you work together on shared goal, you collaborate. If you don't just split a project up evenly but work together on creating solutions, you collaborate.",
    "long": "Inside the word you see co-labor, or \"working together.\" Cooperation is simply splitting up the work and getting it done. Collaboration is when you brainstorm, create, and share possible solutions. During World War II, however, Nazi collaborators were sharing ideas with the wrong side. In today's pop music scene, collaboration means featuring a guest star on a record, and it's often a surefire way to boost sales."
  },
  "human": {
    "short": "Unlike a pickle or a chipmunk, a human is a person. You can identify a human by the two legs it stands on, its upright stature, its high intelligence, and its speech that you'll understand if you're one, too.",
    "long": "Human was first recorded in the mid 13th century, and owes its existence to the Middle French humain “of or belonging to man.” That word, in turn, comes from the Latin humanus, thought to be a hybrid relative of homo, meaning “man,” and humus, meaning “earth.” Thus, a human, unlike birds, planes, or even divine spirits up above, is a man firmly rooted to the earth."
  },
  "avoid": {
    "short": "If you avoid drinking coffee right before bed because it tends to keep you awake and makes you jittery, that means that you stay away from coffee at night.",
    "long": "The verb avoid means to stop yourself from doing something or to keep something from happening. You might avoid the old lady next door who smells funny and always wants to pinch your cheek, or you could avoid a certain dangerous neighborhood in your city by taking a different route when you're walking home. It's easy to get avoid confused with a similar word, evade, which means \"to avoid in a particularly tricky or sneaky way.\""
  },
  "hortative": {
    "short": "Think your parents are too lax about recycling? It might be time to deliver an impassioned, hortative speech about protecting the environment. Hortative language urges the audience to take action.",
    "long": "Anything hortative aims to encourage, urge on, or call to action. This word is most commonly used in the context of rhetoric and debate. For example, your English teacher might ask you to write a hortative essay on an issue about which you care deeply. Hortative, like the word exhort, derives from the Latin verb horari, \"to urge.\""

  },
  "summary": {
    "short": "A summary gives a short overview, or the main points, of something longer. She talked for days about the 800-page romantic novel, but her boyfriend's summary was \"Girl meets boy, boy meets girl, boy rides horse into sunset, girl meets new boy. The end.\"",
    "long": "Summary is a noun, and \"summery\" is an adjective, but they sound alike and both describe something short. A summer feels like a short piece of a long year, and a summary is a short statement about a longer piece. When a long speech or writing needs retelling in a short amount of time, a summary conveys the meaning in fewer words. Often a book cover has a summary of what's inside, and an introduction has a summary of the main points in a chapter."
  },
  "martinet": {
    "short": "Use the noun martinet to describe someone who is a stickler when it comes to following rules, such as the teacher who won't accept homework if it is written in a color other than blue.",
    "long": "Pronounce martinet with the accent on the last syllable: \"mar-ti-NET.\" Jean Martinet, the man for whom the word was coined, would insist you say his name correctly. He was a legendary drillmaster for the French army during the reign of Louis XIV. In 1779, a hundred years after Martinet's death, martinet came to mean any officer who was as strict and demanding in adhering to the rules as Martinet himself."
  },
  "debacle": {
    "short": "Use debacle to refer to a fiasco, disaster, or great failure. If several dogs run onto the field during the big baseball game, tripping players and chewing up the bases, you can call the whole event a debacle.",
    "long": "Debacle is sometimes used to describe a military defeat. If your army retreats, that's one thing. If your army is outmaneuvered and ends up huddled in a valley, surrounded on all sides by the enemy, forced to sing 90s sitcom theme songs by their savage captors — that's a debacle. Debacle comes from the French débâcler, \"to clear,\" — the prefix des- means \"completely, utterly\" and the verb bacler means \"to block.\""
  },
  "festoon": {
    "short": "A festoon is a decorative string of flowers that you drape across a room, dropping in curves between support points. If you're decorating for Halloween, why not try a creatively spooky festoon of dried roses covered in cobwebs?",
    "long": "Festoon probably comes from the Italian word festone, for \"feast,\" and if you can imagine an Italian courtyard strung up with flowers and lanterns, then you have a sense of what it means to festoon a place. A noun or a verb, festoon can mean the decoration itself, or the work of putting it up. Festoons don't strictly have to be made of flowers, though they usually are. You can festoon with fabric too, or paper chains. Or cobwebs."
  },
  "subpoena": {
    "short": "A subpoena is a document that requires its recipient to appear in court as a witness. If you receive a subpoena, it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong; it just means you may have information that's needed by the court.",
    "long": "Subpoena can also be a verb: You can subpoena someone by giving them a subpoena. If you receive a subpoena but fail to carry out its instructions, you're in big trouble. This fact is suggested by the Latin roots of this word: the prefix sub- means \"under\" and poena means \"penalty.\" One nice thing about a subpoena is that it's not a summons; if you get one of those, it means you're being sued."
  },
  "tenuous": {
    "short": "If something is tenuous it's thin, either literally or metaphorically. If you try to learn a complicated mathematical concept by cramming for 45 minutes, you will have a tenuous grasp of that concept, at best.",
    "long": "Tenuous comes from the Latin word tenuis, for thin, and is related to our word tender. Something can be physically tenuous, like a spiderweb or ice on a pond. We more often use it in a metaphorical sense, to talk about weak ideas. Tenuous arguments won't win any debate tournaments. Synonyms for tenuous, also used physically or metaphorically, are flimsy and shaky."
  },
  "brazen": {
    "short": "With brazen disregard for the sign that said \"No Cellphones,\" the woman took a long call in the dentist's waiting room, irritating the other patients. Brazen describes something shocking or done shamelessly.",
    "long": "The Middle English word was brasen, \"made of brass,\" from Old English bræs, \"brass.\" In its literal sense, this word can mean \"made of or resembling brass,\" as in a brazen drinking cup from a medieval castle. It can also mean overly or disrespectfully bold. A near synonym of brazen is our English word brassy, which has the additional meaning of being loud and showy."
  },
  "punctual": {
    "short": "When someone says “Be punctual,” that means you better be there on time. Five minutes late won’t cut it.",
    "long": "Some people seem to follow an appointment clock instinctively. We call those types punctual. They'll check their watch when you arrive three minutes late. The word punctual originates from the Latin word punctualis, which means “a point.” To be punctual, you have to arrive at the right point in time. For your appointment. Get the point?"
  },
  "regime": {
    "short": "A regime is the ruling government of a country. The amount of freedom and restriction that citizens of a country have can change from regime to regime.",
    "long": "Regime takes its militaristic and government feel from the Latin word regimen \"to rule.\" A political regime has a negative association to it that makes you think of totalitarian governments. How did it come to mean \"diet\" or \"program of exercise\" as well? If you are put on a regime of exercise and healthy eating, you are ordered by a doctor to do these things and it probably feels like you're being ruled sometimes!"
  },
  "bashful": {
    "short": "Bashful means shy or timid. You might feel bashful when meeting a famous actress, a high-ranking government official, or just someone whom you find really good-looking.",
    "long": "Bashful and shy are similar in meaning, but not quite identical. Bashful often describes people who are shy but friendly. In fact, being bashful is sometimes seen as an endearing quality. So, you probably wouldn't use bashful to describe a quiet, reserved coworker with whom you have little contact; shy would be a better fit. However, bashful is a perfect description for your good friend who unfortunately becomes tongue-tied whenever she tries to talk to strangers."
  },
  "imperil": {
    "short": "One thing can imperil another when it threatens to be harmful. For example, an approaching storm with hurricane-force winds might imperil the geraniums you just planted in your front yard.",
    "long": "A city's budget cuts might imperil a school's ability to hire new teachers and buy supplies. The lack of money, in other words, is a threat to schools. Likewise, a factory's refusal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions will imperil the air quality nearby — and ultimately, imperil the health of the whole planet. The word imperil comes from in and peril, meaning \"danger.\""
  },
  "magnanimous": {
    "short": "A magnanimous person has a generous spirit. Letting your little sister have the last of the cookies, even though you hadn't eaten since breakfast, would be considered a magnanimous act.",
    "long": "Magnanimous comes from Latin magnus \"great\" and animus \"soul,\" so it literally describes someone who is big-hearted. A person can show that over-sized spirit by being noble or brave, or by easily forgiving others and not showing resentment.  It implies superiority, and is something you should say of others rather than of yourself. Being magnanimous doesn't require doling out tons of cash — just being an understanding and tolerant soul will do the trick."
  },
  "steep": {
    "short": "Steep means sharply angled. When hiking trails lead straight up mountainsides, they've got a steep incline. Steep also means \"to soak in,\" as in steeping a tea bag in boiling water.",
    "long": "You often hear steep used as an adjective to describe cliffs, hills, or even water park slides that have a perilous slope. Steep can apply to curves on a chart––you might say when someone who has a lot to learn that their learning curve is going to be steep. Steep also comes up to describe exorbitant changes in costs or spending. Everyone would love to travel more, but sometimes plane fare is too steep."
  },
  "captious": {
    "short": "If someone tends to be hypercritical and find fault with everything, you can describe that person as captious. Try not to be described as a captious person yourself, however. No one likes a carping individual!",
    "long": "Captious comes from the Middle French word captieux, which is from the Latin word captiosus meaning fallacious or deceiving. This is, in fact, another meaning for the adjective captious, something is calculated to confuse or deceive — such as a captious explanation of the facts. When a person is described as captious, the sense is usually of nitpicking at faults or raising petty objections. It is usually used to imply a permanent character or personality flaw, as opposed to a momentary lapse in understanding."
  },
  "itinerant": {
    "short": "An itinerant is a person who moves from place to place, typically for work, like the itinerant preacher who moves to a new community every few years.",
    "long": "Itinerant is pronounced \"eye-TIN-er-ant.\" It might remind you of itinerary, the traveler's schedule that lists flights, hotel check-in times, and other plans. It's no surprise that both words come from the Latin word itinerare, meaning \"to travel.\" Itinerant was first used in the 16th century to describe circuit judges who traveled to faraway courtrooms. Today, almost anyone can be an itinerant."
  },
  "reciprocal": {
    "short": "Reciprocal describes something that's the same on both sides. If you and your sister are in a big fight on a long car trip, you might resolve it through a reciprocal agreement that you'll stop poking her and she'll stop reading road signs out loud.",
    "long": "The word mutual is a near synonym in most uses: reciprocal/mutual friendship, describing, a relationship in which two people feel the same way about each other, or do or give similar things to each other. If you tell someone you like them and they say, \"The feelings are reciprocal,\" that means they like you too. In math, a reciprocal is a number that when multiplied by a given number gives one as a product."
  },
  "inadvertent": {
    "short": "When something happens by accident, it's inadvertent, or unintentional.  The gas company assured you that the error in your bill  was inadvertent and that they would fix it, but not before you blew off some steam.",
    "long": "If you break down the adjective inadvertent you find the word vert, from the Latin vertere, meaning \"to turn.\"  Advertent comes to mean \"turning the mind to,\" and as the prefix in- means \"not,\" inadvertent means “not turning the mind to,” or \"not intending to.\" When your actions are inadvertent you're not paying attention to their consequences.  Remember that inadvertent ends with -ent by remembering this sentence: “We inadvertently ripped the tent.”"
  },
  "saturated": {
    "short": "Saturated means drenched and full. When you fish out a slice of bread that’s fallen into your water glass and find it’s disgustingly spongy and waterlogged, it’s saturated.",
    "long": "Saturated originally meant “satisfied,\" but by the 1700s it could mean “soaked thoroughly.” In the twentieth century it developed marketing connotations, as in a saturated market — one without room for competition. In chemistry, saturated refers to an organic compound, like a fatty acid, that contains the highest number of hydrogen atoms possible. When it comes to color, saturated means pure, or undiluted with white, grey, or black."
  },
  "inane": {
    "short": "If something is inane, it's silly or senseless. If you just want to space out, you won't mind the inane chatter on TV, as long as it's on.",
    "long": "Inane comes from the Latin inanis, for empty, and you can think of it as empty-headed.  We call something inane if it states the obvious, or is really silly in a way that seems unintelligent. If you give your boss a presentation in a bunny suit and sing a song about being happy, she might say, \"Get out of here with your inane bunny act!\"  Other synonyms are stupid, vacuous, ridiculous, pointless."
  },
  "supple": {
    "short": "Something or someone that is supple bends and moves easily, like a contortionist at a circus sideshow. If you can wrap your legs around your neck, you most likely have a supple body.",
    "long": "Supple is often used as an adjective describing a body — such as a dancer’s; a fabric — such as soft leather; or a sound — such as an accomplished singer’s voice. This makes for a strange supple family, but all of its members can move with ease and flexibility. More idiomatically, supple can also be used to describe a mind. In this sense, it does not mean “easily brainwashed,” but has a more positive association with the open-mindedness of free-thinkers."
  },
  "sully": {
    "short": "To sully is to attack someone's good name and to try to ruin his reputation. If you spread false rumors that there's chicken stock in the vegetarian entree at Joe's Diner, you would sully Joe's good reputation.",
    "long": "Sully can also mean to tarnish or make spotty. It's easy to remember this meaning when you know that sully comes from the Middle French word souiller, meaning, \"make dirty.\" For example, dripping chocolate sauce onto the table will sully your mother's new white tablecloth. Another meaning of sully is to corrupt or cast suspicion on. If an automaker recalls millions of vehicles due to safety problems, it doesn't exactly inspire confidence — in fact, it may sully their brand."
  },
  "oscillate": {
    "short": "On a hot day, you’ll be happy to have a fan that can oscillate, meaning it moves back and forth in a steady motion.",
    "long": "The verb oscillate can be traced back to the Latin word oscillum, meaning \"swing,\" so it makes sense that oscillate is used to describe an object like a fan or a pendulum that swings from side to side. The word also can be used to describe a different kind of motion — the wavering of someone who is going back and forth between conflicting beliefs or actions. If you’ve ever had trouble making up your mind about something, you probably know what it feels like to oscillate — back and forth from one decision and to another and then back again. And again. And again."
  },
  "coalesce": {
    "short": "Waiting for a plan to come together? You're waiting for it to coalesce. Coalesce is when different elements of something join together and become one.",
    "long": "In coalesce, you see co-, which should tell you the word means \"together.\" The other half of the word comes from alescere, a Latin verb meaning \"to grow up.\" So if you are trying to start up a photography club at school, once you have an advisor, some interested students and support from the administration, things will be coalescing or growing together. Another way to remember that? An adolescent is one who is growing. A lot!"

  },
  "decadence": {
    "short": "Whether in reference to chocolate cake for breakfast or wild all-night parties, decadence means extravagance, luxury, and self-indulgence with a sense of moral decline.",
    "long": "The Latin root of decadence means \"to fall down,\" and this may help you understand the full sense of the word. Decadence is not simply a synonym for excess; it also suggests that one's morals have gone down. The word is usually negative but not always. When hostile critics called a group of French writers and artists in the late 1800s decadents, these poets and painters embraced the label. When a pastry chef calls her creation Chocolate Decadence, she is promoting a mildly guilty pleasure, not announcing the end of Western civilization."
  },
  "foster": {
    "short": "To foster is to nurture something. A teacher could foster creativity by providing crayons to every student. You can also foster a child, which means the child lives in your home for a time.",
    "long": "You may have seen photos of a cat taking care of a baby rabbit, or a pig nursing a litter of puppies: those are little foster families. Foster can be a verb (to foster someone or something) or an adjective used to describe a foster family, child, or parent. The word is from the Old English fostrian meaning \"to supply with food, nourish, support,\" which sounds like what those mama hogs were doing. Unlike adopt, foster has a time limit."
  },
  "boor": {
    "short": "A boor is a crude, rude person. Boors lack sophistication and manners.",
    "long": "Boors are worse than boring; they’re offensive and repulsive. To be a boor is to be an obnoxious, unsophisticated oaf. A boor would swear in church. A boor would talk too loudly on the train. A boor would get too drunk at a wedding reception. Boors lack manners and taste. When a boor is around, other people want to leave. If you have self-control and culture, you’ll never be accused of being a boor."
  },
  "concur": {
    "short": "To concur is to agree or approve of something. If someone says something you agree with, you can say \"I concur!\"",
    "long": "Like many words with con, concur has to do with agreement and being together. When you concur, you agree with someone about something or let them know you approve. \"I concur\" is a formal (and sometimes humorous) way of saying \"I agree!\" or \"I hear that!\" Also, two events that happen at the same time can be said to concur. People are happy when good things concur, like when a birthday and nice weather happen at the same time."
  },
  "indignant": {
    "short": "When you're indignant, you're angry about an unfair situation. If you discovered that a teacher gave ten extra points on a test to all students who sat in the front row, you'd be indignant.",
    "long": "Indignant is from Latin indignus \"unworthy,\" and it refers to anger based on unworthy or unfair behavior rather than merely injury to one's own interests. You may be angry, even furious, if someone shoves you, but you are indignant if the shove is directed at someone weak or helpless.  The related noun is indignation, and something that arouses indignation is an indignity."
  },
  "escalate": {
    "short": "If an argument between you and your brother progresses from mean looks to a fist fight, you could say that the tension between the two of you escalated. To escalate is intensify or increase quickly.",
    "long": "When you see this word, picture an escalator that takes you up to the next floor quickly. But remember, there's something you don't like on that higher level because it's usually bad if something escalates. Prices escalate when something becomes scarce, be it a popular toy, a concert ticket, or food during a crisis. And if a war or conflict escalates, it becomes more intense and violent."
  },
  "ostentatious": {
    "short": "Reach for the adjective ostentatious when you want a flashy way to say — well, \"flashy\" or \"showy.\"",
    "long": "No one wants to be described as ostentatious, a word whose cousins include pretentious, flamboyant, and gaudy. It originates from the Latin word ostentare, \"to display,\" but in English it's often used for displays of the crass or vulgar sort. A rapper's diamond-encrusted teeth might be an ostentatious display of \"bling,\" and someone wailing especially loudly at a funeral of a distant acquaintance might be making an ostentatious show of sorrow."
  },
  "deter": {
    "short": "Deter means to discourage, or literally “to frighten away.” Halloween decorations that are too scary might deter trick-or-treaters, and the risk of being expelled deters kids from cheating in school.",
    "long": "Deter comes from the Latin de meaning \"away\" and terrere meaning \"frighten.\" Something that deters isn’t always scary, though: citronella plants deter mosquitoes, and fines deter people from littering. Teddy Roosevelt's foreign policy dictum \"speak softly and carry a big stick\" was meant to deter other countries from attacking the United States."

  "subside": {
    "short": "To subside is to die down or become less violent, like rough ocean waves after a storm has passed (or your seasickness, if you happened to be sailing on that ocean).",
    "long": "Subside comes from the Latin prefix sub- (meaning \"down\") and the Latin verb sidere (meaning \"to settle\"). Subside is often used when a negative situation has improved significantly. For example, violence, disease, and unemployment can all subside. Here's hoping that they do."
  },
  "intrepid": {
    "short": "Intrepid is just a fancy word for describing a person or action that is bold and brave. Super heroes are intrepid in their struggle for truth and justice.",
    "long": "Some synonyms are fearless, courageous, dauntless, or valiant, but the word intrepid suggests a lack of fear in dealing with something new or unknown. This adjective comes from Latin intrepidus, formed from the prefix in-, \"not\" and trepidus, \"alarmed.\""

  "disperse": {
    "short": "To make a crowd at a party disperse, you could take away the food, turn off the music and ask for volunteers to clean up. Disperse is to spread out people or things, making them move in different directions.",
    "long": "Imagine yourself standing on a basketball court holding a cup packed tight with marbles. If you turn it over, the marbles will disperse across the floor, moving away from you in all directions. Another word for this is scatter. Don't confuse this word with disburse, which means to distribute money. Remember that false friends disperse when you cease to disburse."
  },
  "adorn": {
    "short": "To adorn is to dress something up by decorating it. You might adorn your poncho with fringe or your poodle's dog collar with rhinestones.",
    "long": "Adorn shares some Latin roots with words like ornament and ornate. So it makes sense that some people adorn their Christmas trees with tinsel and lights. Others adorn their eyelids with glitter. In any case, if you want to adorn yourself with all kinds of fabulous baubles, it might be wise to follow Coco Chanel's advice: take at least one accessory off before you walk out the door."
  },
  "portend": {
    "short": "Portend means to show a sign that something calamitous is about to happen. The teetering, tottering, pile of fine china piled up after the dinner party portends an imminent crash of broken plates and dishes.",
    "long": "Portend is a verb warning of omens, or bad signs. Dark clouds rumbling in over a county fair in Kansas portend the thunderstorm and even tornado that is likely to ruin the festivities. Portend is a helpful way for authors to foreshadow dark events ahead in their stories."
  },
  "avert": {
    "short": "To avert is to turn away or to prevent. You might avert your gaze or avert a disaster — either way, you are avoiding something.",
    "long": "The verb avert comes from Latin roots that mean \"to turn away from.\" Averting has that sense of deflecting, turning away, or preventing something (usually bad) from happening. You might put salt on an icy sidewalk to avert accidents, or you might avert a toddler's meltdown by supplying a lollipop."
  },
  "bombastic": {
    "short": "To be bombastic is to be full of hot air — like a politician who makes grand promises and doesn't deliver.",
    "long": "What does cotton padding have to do with the word bombastic? Bombast was cotton padding or stuffing in the 1500s. Bombastic evolved as an adjective to describe something (or someone!) that is overly wordy, pompous, or pretentious, but the adjective is most often used to describe language (speech or writing). Still not seeing the connection to cotton padding? Think of writing or speech that is overly padded and you'll understand how the meaning came about."
  },
  "insomnia": {
    "short": "A person who has trouble falling or staying asleep is suffering from insomnia. If after a hot bath, a glass of warm milk, and hours of counting sheep, you still find yourself lying wide awake in bed, it's time to admit you have insomnia.",
    "long": "There's no cure for insomnia, but people with insomnia are advised to go to bed at the same time every night and to try to avoid stress. The noun insomnia was borrowed from Latin insomnis \"sleepless,\" from the prefix in-, \"not,\" plus somnus, \"sleep.\" Somnus is actually related to Greek hypnos \"sleep,\" the source of English words such as hypnosis and hypnotic."
  },
  "fabrication": {
    "short": "A fabrication is something made up, like a lie. Telling your boss that the subway broke down when in fact you just forgot to set your alarm is a fabrication.",
    "long": "The word fabrication was originally used to talk about manufacturing or construction, and it referred to the act of assembling something. Tires and steering wheels are necessary materials for automobile fabrication. Nowadays, the word fabrication is usually used to refer to the act of coming up with a story out of thin air. In this sense, a book of fiction is a fabrication, as is the lie you tell your girlfriend to explain why you forgot her birthday (again)."
  },
  "personification": {
    "short": "Personification means \"giving human qualities to an abstract idea,\" as in a movie villain who is the personification of evil.",
    "long": "You can use the noun personification in two ways. In the first, a person who is known for a certain quality, like wisdom, is said to represent that quality in a way any can understand, like a patient, generous person who is the personification of kindness. On the other hand, personification can give human qualities to something that isn’t human. For example, you might say, “The sea is angry,” assigning it a human emotion."
  },
  "vow": {
    "short": "To vow is to make an earnest promise or pledge. People getting married often vow to stick together “till death do us part,” while a presidential candidate might vow to lower taxes.",
    "long": "You can use vow as both a noun and a verb: A vow is a solemn declaration; to vow is the act of making that promise. Vows are meant to be serious, sacred things, even vows made with the best intentions can be broken. Wrote American short-story writer and poet Dorothy Parker, “By the time you swear you are his, shivering and sighing, And he vows his passion is infinite and undying—Lady, make a note of this: One of you is lying.”"
  },
  "opine": {
    "short": "The verb opine is used when someone speaks up and expresses an opinion. You might opine that dogs are highly preferable to cats.",
    "long": "Whenever you have something to say about a subject, you have the option to opine about it or keep your mouth shut. Movie critics opine about the best films of the year, and kindergarten kids opine that they'd rather not take a nap. Opine can also describe what you suppose will happen, like when you opine that school lunches will improve because of the new cook. The Latin opinari, or have an opinion, is the root of opine."
  },
  "felon": {
    "short": "Technically, a felon is anyone who's been convicted of a serious crime, but you can use felon to describe anyone you think has done something terrible.",
    "long": "For a felon, it's being paraded in handcuffs in front of the public that can be the worst part of being convicted. In some countries, you're considered a felon simply because the king says that you are. Here in the U.S., though, you're innocent until proven guilty, at which point people can call you a felon. My boyfriend took the dog, the TV, and my expensive French sauté pan after we broke up. If you ever run into the felon, please kick him in the shins, and tell him he's a criminal."
  },
  "opportunist": {
    "short": "Opportunists are people who see a chance to gain some advantage from a situation, often at the expense of ethics or morals. An opportunist seizes every opportunity to improve things for himself.",
    "long": "Say you won millions in the lottery. People would come out of the woodwork hoping to get their hands on some of it. These people act as if they are close friends. But they are not; they are opportunists. Famous opportunists include “carpetbaggers,” Northern opportunists who, after the American Civil War, poured into the South to turn Reconstruction into personal financial gains."
  },
  "astronomy": {
    "short": "Astronomy is the science that looks up: at stars, at other planets, at solar systems, at galaxies, and at everything else in the universe.",
    "long": "The Ancient Greeks used the word astron for \"star,\" so it only makes sense that astronomy would involve the study or the stars (and other unearthly topics). Someone who studies or works in astronomy is an astronomer, and one of the main tools of the trade is the telescope. As telescopes get more and more powerful, astronomers learn more and more about what's going on out there, such as how old a star or planet is. If you ever wondered what's out there besides the Earth, you should learn more about astronomy."
  },
  "tout": {
    "short": "To tout means to praise, boast, or brag about. If you like to tout your skill as a skier, you tell people you can go down expert-level hills.",
    "long": "Sometimes parents will get into bragging wars about their children, each touting the accomplishments of his or her child. Sometimes the word means more of \"to claim.\" The company touted the lotion as a solution to wrinkles. Broccoli has been touted as the cancer-fighting vegetable. In England, a tout is a person who gives advice about gambling. If you're looking to play some money on the ponies, go see the tout who hangs out at Jackie’s bar for a tip."
  },
  "synchronize": {
    "short": "When you synchronize things, you make them happen at the same time. If you have rhythm, you can synchronize your dance moves with the beat of the music. If not, stay off the dance floor.",
    "long": "Synchronize, pronounced \"SINK-ruh-nize,\" means \"to make things happen at the same time\" — even down to a fraction of a second, as in synchronized swimming. In that sport, one movement that doesn't sync, or match up, costs the swimmers points. When you synchronize your wristwatches, people can't blame their watches being fast or slow if they don't come to the meeting spot at the right time."
  },
  "subdue": {
    "short": "To subdue is to hold back, put down, or defeat. A Doberman can be subdued with a bone, but subduing a yapping toy poodle can be a mail carrier's greatest daily challenge.",
    "long": "You can use the verb subdue in ways ranging from subtle to very forceful. If someone is angry, you might subdue him with kind words that overcome his anger. If someone is coming at you with a giant karate chop, you may be able to subdue her with a secret weapon — a knee-snap–heel-kick-floor-drop. Sub-, as in submarine means \"below\" and subdue means to bring low — to keep down literally or to calm down emotionally."
  },
  "deluge": {
    "short": "Feeling overwhelmed, like you're underwater? You might be experiencing a deluge — like when you've been given a deluge of homework over vacation: a dozen term papers, two dozen books to read, and a mile-high stack of math problems.",
    "long": "The noun deluge is an overwhelming amount of something in general, such as work, people, or questions. Because of its Latin roots, however, in particular it means an overwhelming amount of water. It comes from diluvian, which means flood. The verb deluge similarly means to overwhelm or inundate with something, particularly water. The hurricane deluged the island with rain. A deluge isn't always a bad thing, however. One thing most people would like to be deluged with? Money."
  },
  "sanguinary": {
    "short": "When something is sanguinary it involves a lot of blood or, at least, the pursuit of blood. Vampire movies are sanguinary: Romper Room is not.",
    "long": "If you're familiar with French, then you'll recognize the French word for \"blood,\" sang, in sanguinary. And if you do, then you'll have no trouble remembering the meaning, \"having a bloodthirsty quality.\" Movies have become increasingly sanguinary. Why all the blood and gore? What happened to good old-fashioned suspense?"
  },
  "presumption": {
    "short": "The noun presumption pretty much means jumping to conclusions. It is taking something for granted — an idea, an answer, an event — without having any real knowledge about it, and that is usually not a good thing.",
    "long": "Making a presumption means assuming something is true or false without getting all the information necessary for verification. You can decipher this from the prefix pre, which means \"before,\" together with the sume — from the Latin sumere, \"to take.\" Because so many times a presumption turns out to be false, the word has a negative connotation to it; there's something reckless about making up your mind before you know all the facts."
  },
  "ingrate": {
    "short": "If your kind act of buying a donut for your friend gets you nothing but a complaint that the chocolate icing looks runny, then it sounds like your pal is an ingrate, someone who is not thankful for others' kindness.",
    "long": "The noun ingrate comes for the Latin word ingratus, a combination of in-, meaning “not,” and gratus, or “grateful.” That pretty much sums up an ingrate: not grateful. It describes someone who tends to act this way in general, rarely acknowledging others' generosity, or even worse, seeming to expect special treatment. You can tell someone is an ingrate by what isn't said: \"thank you\" and \"I appreciate what you've done for me.\""
  },
  "formal": {
    "short": "Being formal is all about being taken seriously. If you're invited to the White House, you'll want to make a good impression, so it's a good idea to adopt a generally formal demeanor. No jeans or trash talking allowed.",
    "long": "In our casual world, there are still many times we need to be formal, like at weddings or funerals.  Adopting a formal manner — i.e., dressing up and not eating with your hands — will help you make a good impression on job interviewers or future in-laws. Being formal doesn't have to mean being stiff or unnatural; it's basically just using good manners and following the rules."
  },
  "founder": {
    "short": "The person who creates an organization or a company is known as the founder. Founder is also a verb meaning \"fail miserably,\" which is something a company's founder hopes the company will never do.",
    "long": "As a noun, founder means \"the beginner or originator of something.\" You might talk about the founder of a nation, the founder of club, or the founder of a website. As a verb, founder can mean “stumble,” like when you trip and fall, but more generally it means \"collapse or fall apart.\" A sports team might founder by slumping on a ten-game losing streak; a ship that sinks in a bad storm can be said to have foundered at sea."
  },
  "enmity": {
    "short": "Enmity means intense hostility. If you're a football fanatic, you feel enmity for your opposing team.",
    "long": "Enmity comes from the same Latin root as enemy, and means the state of being an enemy. If you have always hated someone, you have a history of enmity with that person. Enmity is stronger than antagonism or animosity, which imply competitive feeling but don't go all the way to enemy status. Hopefully you are a peacemaker and don't experience too much enmity in your life."
  },
  "apostasy": {
    "short": "If your lifelong Republican-voting grandfather suddenly decides to register as a Democrat, some of his conservative friends may consider his change in politics to be apostasy, or rejecting what has been a strong belief and adopting a new one.",
    "long": "When you abandon a set of beliefs, especially when they're religious beliefs, you can be accused of apostasy, which in some countries is actually illegal. It's taken seriously by many churches, since the rejection of a church's ideas can be seen as a criticism of the entire organization. Over time, the meaning of apostasy has grown to include non-religious examples, like your grandfather's political switch."
  },
  "demand": {
    "short": "Demand means \"an urgent request,\" like your demand that teachers give no homework on the weekend, or the act of making the request — teachers who demand that the work get done, even if it's the weekend.",
    "long": "Demand comes from the Old French word demander, meaning \"ask, make inquiry.\" A demand is a lot stronger than that, however. When you demand something, you want action now. A demand can also mean \"to require\" like cold weather that demands warm coats and boots. Demand is also an economic term, meaning \"the amount of an item that can be sold,\" like the demand for those snow boots: high in winter and nonexistent in summer."
  },
  "tantalize": {
    "short": "When you tantalize people, you torment them in a specific way — by showing them something they want but can’t have. You could tantalize people with cavities and nut allergies by eating pecan pie in front of them.",
    "long": "The word tantalize comes from a Greek story about a guy named Tantalus who was so evil that the gods of the underworld came up with a special punishment just for him (they were really good at that). They put him in a pool of water that drained away every time he bent down to drink.  There was also a tree above his head that whisked away its juicy apples every time he tried to pick one. So, it only makes sense that to tantalize someone is to torture them with what they cannot have."
  },
  "paltry": {
    "short": "A paltry amount is so small it's not even worth thinking about. In the novel Oliver Twist, when Oliver is given a paltry amount of gruel — not nearly enough — he asks, \"Please, sir, can I have some more?\"",
    "long": "Paltry is a laughably small amount — the waiter might chuck a paltry tip in the garbage. If you have only 50 cents in your bank account, it's such a paltry amount, you may as well be broke. It can also mean \"not worth considering\" or \"not important.\" If you keep breaking your promises, your friends will get sick of your paltry excuses."
  },
  "conceit": {
    "short": "If you’re always boasting and can’t stop talking about yourself, you have that character flaw known as conceit. Your friends — if you have any — may also complain about your arrogance, vanity, and egotism.",
    "long": "A conceit can also be an artistic device — probably a little forced — like the plot of a movie built on the conceit of everything that happens being foretold in song. You might find an architectural conceit in a Baroque palace, where you think you’re looking down a long hallway lined with columns, but when you get closer you see that it's really a mural painted in perspective so that the columns only seem to disappear in the distance."
  },
  "hamper": {
    "short": "Anything that hampers slows progress or makes it difficult to do something. You might think that the presence of your parents hampers your ability to look cool.",
    "long": "The verb hamper is for those times when normal progress is slow but not shut down completely. Hamper often describes travel during bad weather, like icy conditions that could hamper holiday travel. Hamper means \"slow going.\" You may have heard of noun form of hamper, a container for holding dirty laundry: If your hamper is full, the need to do laundry could hamper your plans of going out and having fun."
  },
  "infelicitous": {
    "short": "You can use the adjective infelicitous when something doesn't work quite right, whether it's a remark or a wrong turn down a dark street or an unfortunate outfit worn to a job interview.",
    "long": "If the ultimate outcome is awkward or unhappy, it's infelicitous. It would be infelicitous to complain about the broken air conditioning in your Mercedes while volunteering at a homeless shelter. In other words, it would be dreadfully inappropriate. Since the 1530s, infelicitous has been used to mean the opposite of felicitous, meaning \"happy,\" which comes from the Latin word for \"happiness,\" felicitas."

  "egoist": {
    "short": "",

  },
  "consecrated": {
    "short": "When something is consecrated it is declared to be sacred or holy. Many Catholics, for example, believe that bread and wine are consecrated, or made sacred during Holy Communion, becoming the body and blood of Christ.",
    "long": "The word consecrated is made up of the Latin suffix con-, which expresses intensive force and sacrare, meaning \"dedicate.\" Something that is consecrated is intensely dedicated to the point of being declared holy. It's not just bread and wine that people believe to be consecrated. You might call a cemetery \"consecrated ground.\""
  },
  "moderate": {
    "short": "A moderate voter is someone who is politically speaking, in the center. In other words, they are not quite left or right, but somewhere in the middle.",
    "long": "Moderate comes from the Latin for \"medium sized,\" and as a noun and an adjective it means \"middle, medium.\" If you get moderate rainfall, it's not too much and not too little. Goldilocks was known for her moderate tastes. As a verb, it means \"to temper,\" or \"to reduce from the extreme.\" If you moderate your speed while driving, you slow down a bit. If you moderate a discussion, you help two or more people have a reasonable conversation."
  },
  "perigee": {
    "short": "The perigee is the point in the orbit of an object circling the Earth when that object is closest to the Earth. The best time to observe the moon is when the moon reaches its perigee.",
    "long": "The Greek ancestor of the word perigee was originally used by Ptolemy, a Roman scientist and astrologer who lived almost 2,000 years ago. The opposite of perigee is apogee. A perigee is measured from the center of the earth to the center of the orbiting object. When the moon is at its perigee, it can appear up to 14 percent larger than when it is at its apogee, but you probably can't tell the difference with the naked eye."
  },
  "metaphysical": {
    "short": "Add the Greek prefix \"meta-\" (beyond) to the base \"physical\" (nature), and you get metaphysical — a near synonym to the Latinate word \"supernatural.\" Both concern phenomena that are outside everyday experience or knowledge.",
    "long": "The adjective metaphysical entered the English language through Aristotle, whose Metaphysics is a collection of treatises that follows his Physics. Physics concerned natural philosophy, what we would call \"science\" today, while Metaphysics dealt with more abstract questions about the reality beyond what we perceive with our senses. Look at a physical object, say an apple. At what exact point did that apple come into existence? If you eat it, does it cease to exist, or does it still exist but in a changed way? These are metaphysical questions."
  },
  "laud": {
    "short": "To laud someone means to praise them extravagantly — usually in a very public manner. A music critic might laud a new song by calling it the best summer anthem ever created.",
    "long": "The word laud is from the Latin word laudere, meaning \"to praise.” To laud someone is to glorify them, or to sing their praises, even if you’re not actually singing. Movie reviewers might laud Oscar-nominated films, and your high school principal might laud the class valedictorian at graduation."
  },
  "retaliate": {
    "short": "To retaliate means to get back at someone, usually through a counterattack. “Ned got hit with a cream pie, then he retaliated by throwing a bucket of Jell-O at his attackers.”",
    "long": "When you see the prefix re in a word, it usually means back. To return, remember, regurgitate (yuck) — all of these verbs relate to doing something back. At the beginning of retaliate it means back, and the taliate means to pay, so what you’re talking about here is payback. If you’re doing something terrible to someone just because you want to, that’s doesn’t mean to retaliate. But, if you feel they’ve done something bad to you, and you’re just getting them back? That’s when you retaliate."
  },
  "histrionic": {
    "short": "Anything that has to do with actors or acting can be called  histrionic, like a Broadway actor's histrionic voice projection that would sound strange in everyday life but is perfect for the stage.",
    "long": "The adjective  histrionic, pronounced \"his-tree-ON-ic,\" comes from the Latin words histrionicus and histrio which mean “actor.” It can describe things that have to do with acting on the stage, but it can also describe a person who in regular life is a little too dramatic and even over-acts, like your friend whose histrionic rantings make a trip to the grocery store seem like a matter of life and death."
  },
  "insignia": {
    "short": "An insignia is a badge you wear to show your position or affiliation. If you're an Eagle Scout, you can wear that insignia, or, if you're a Red Sox fan, you might wear the team logo as your insignia.",
    "long": "The word insignia includes the word \"sign\" — an insignia is a sign that shows your connection to some organization. Military officers wear insignias that indicate their rank. When you watch the president of the United States give a speech, you'll see on the lectern the official presidential insignia — the circular seal with the eagle inside."
  },
  "decadent": {
    "short": "If your friend vacations in lavish hotels, wears thousand-dollar shoes, and refuses to eat cheese that costs less than $20 an ounce, you might say her lifestyle is decadent.",
    "long": "A decadent is a person who has fallen into a state of moral or artistic decay. Typically, though, we use decadent as an adjective to describe wasteful indulgence or extravagance. Celebrities who find themselves unable to manage sudden fame and fortune sometimes go overboard, throwing million-dollar parties, living the fast life, turning to drugs and alcohol. And because they're famous, we read about them and their decadent lifestyles in the tabloid papers."
  },
  "evince": {
    "short": "The verb evince means to show or express clearly or to make plain. Evidence can evince the innocence of the accused, and tears can evince the grief of mourning.",
    "long": "Evince is a rather formal word that reveals the presence of something hidden — usually a feeling. So, if you are happy, your smile might evince your happiness. And if you are angry, the skull and crossbones on your tee shirt might evince your anger. Evincing is about expressing. If you are keeping your feelings inside, there's not a lot of evincing going on."
  },
  "camouflage": {
    "short": "To camouflage is to disguise, and a camouflage is that which disguises — like the leaf-colored and patterned uniforms worn by soldiers who want to blend in with their natural surroundings.",
    "long": "Camouflage evolved from the French camoufler, which was slang for “to disguise.” Camoufler itself most likely comes from camouflet, meaning “puff of smoke” — a puff of smoke that makes it hard to see things. Camouflaged clothing certainly hides hunters from their prey, but the word can also be used in a more figurative sense, as in camouflaging criticism by veiling it as a backhanded compliment."
  },
  "acidulous": {
    "short": "If you make lemonade and forget the sugar, the drink would have an acidulous or sour taste. If someone makes a snarky comment about your culinary skills, you might call their comments acidulous or bitter.",
    "long": "In either usage, the word acidulous leaves a sour taste in your mouth, or a pursed expression on your face. You see the word acid in the word, which, in fact, can also be used in both senses. Someone's acid remarks will be just as hurtful as their acidulous ones. Lemons are an acidic fruit, as are most citrus fruits, but lemons are more acidulous than oranges."
  },
  "vile": {
    "short": "Surely only an evil person could be so vile as to have made you so angry. Vile is something or someone so morally wrong or offensive as to be thoroughly disgusting.",
    "long": "Are you appalled by someone’s sordid, despicable, ugly and just generally awful behavior? Then it’s probably vile, too. One of those dramatic adjectives with many synonyms, the word vile is not only used to describe a person or an action that is morally reprehensible; it can describe a smell that is so bad as to be practically morally reprehensible — or something else that offends your senses enough to make you nauseous. Those three month old dirty gym socks? They’re vile!"
  },
  "fallibility": {
    "short": "Fallibility is the tendency to be wrong or make mistakes. Your fallibility in guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar means you can't count on getting the number right and winning a prize.",
    "long": "Fallibility is a quality that everyone has, since we all make misjudgments from time to time. You might remark on the fallibility of your little brother's plan to row a boat from Connecticut to Florida, especially if there's a hole in the boat and he's not a strong swimmer. The plan, in other words, has too many errors to work well. The Latin root is fallibilis, \"liable to err or deceitful.\""
  },
  "peccadillo": {
    "short": "A peccadillo is a minor offense or sin. Parents recognize that their kids have a few peccadilloes: they don't always remember to say please and thank you, don't put their dirty clothes in the hamper, and worst of all, they keep finding the chocolate stash!",
    "long": "Peccadillo is based on the Spanish word peccado, meaning \"sin,\" with a diminutive added, making peccadillo a small sin. How big a sin is a peccadillo? Well, that depends on whom you ask. The person committing the offense is likely to try to pass off any number of transgressions and mistakes as peccadilloes. If you apologize and are forgiven, it's probably a peccadillo. If your transgression could get you fired, it's probably not!"
  },
  "ascribe": {
    "short": "Ascribe means to give credit to, like if you ascribe the A you got on your group project to the hard work of your partners!",
    "long": "Ascribe's Latin root is ascribere, meaning basically \"to write in.'' Makes sense, because ascribe is often used to link writers to their words. Many a quirky quote, like \"Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter,\" is ascribed to that famous scribe Mark Twain. It can also be a way of blaming something —  you might ascribe your bad attitude to your mom because she won't let you have cupcakes for dinner."
  },
  "hogwash": {
    "short": "Hogwash is complete nonsense, lies, or ridiculous actions. If an advertisement claims that taking one vitamin pill a day will make you ten times stronger, that's hogwash.",
    "long": "The informal hogwash is perfect for talking about falsehoods and foolishness. Your little brother may insist that his lemonade stand will make him a millionaire this summer, but you know that's hogwash. And many politicians give long speeches that seem, in retrospect, to be nothing but hogwash. The word has seen a dramatic evolution, from the fifteenth century \"slops fed to pigs,\" to \"cheap liquor\" in the 1700s, to \"inferior writing\" towards the end of the eighteenth century."

  "centimeter": {
    "short": "In the metric system, a centimeter is a unit of measurement that's about one-third the size of an inch. There are approximately 30 centimeters in a foot.",
    "long": "The word centimeter comes from the French centimètre, a combination of the Latin word for \"hundred,\" centum, and the French mètre. A centimeter is one hundredth of a meter—in other words, there are one hundred centimeters in one meter. In just about every part of the world besides the U.S., this word is spelled centimetre."

  "impolitic": {
    "short": "If you've ever put your foot in your mouth, you've probably said something impolitic. If you have made an impolitic statement, it was a politically unwise one.",
    "long": "It is impolitic to fail to remember flowers for your beloved on Valentine's Day, or to fail to show up in class when your grade point average is hanging by a thread. Remember back in 1981 when then U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig informed the press after the assassination attempt on President Reagan that \"I am in control here?\" Well that was a classic impolitic statement. Poor guy resigned the following year."

  "measure": {
    "short": "To measure something is to figure out how much of it is there. A measure can also be a step toward a goal: take measures to ensure you don't flunk an exam by cracking the books.",
    "long": "You can take measures to improve your health: limit sweets, get enough rest, get some exercise, and wash your hands to avoid the spread of germs. The noun also means a standard for comparison. You can measure your time against the good you will do if you volunteer to help out a child via a mentoring program."
  },
  "impermeable": {
    "short": "If you have a waterproof raincoat, you could say that your coat is impermeable to the rain. Something that is impermeable does not allow water or liquid to pass through it.",
    "long": "Made up of the prefix im-, meaning “not,” and the adjective permeable, meaning “allowing to pass through,” impermeable is used in much the same way as impervious or impenetrable. However, more so than these words, impermeable is especially associated with liquids and is often used in a scientific or technical context. Some gadgets, like waterproof watches and underwater cameras, are designed to be impermeable."
  },
  "appraise": {
    "short": "When you buy a house someone will need to appraise its value before you can get a mortgage. To appraise something is to figure out its worth in the marketplace, on the field, or in the world of ideas.",
    "long": "To appraise the value of a friendship is difficult, but to appraise the value of your grandfather’s pocket watch — just go to the pawn shop. The verb appraise comes from the Late Latin word appretiare, which means “value” or “estimate.” You can appraise your chances of marrying royalty, which are probably slim. You can also appraise the value of a quarterback on your fantasy football team by looking at the statistics for his completed passes."
  },
  "impotent": {
    "short": "Impotent means lacking power or authority. Captain Bligh was impotent in the face of Christian's mutiny. It also refers to a man's inability to achieve or maintain an erection. If a man is sterile, or unable to reproduce, he is also called impotent.",
    "long": "Those wacky ancients really knew how to mess with you — simply add the prefix im to the front of potent, which means \"powerful,\" and you get its opposite — \"powerless.\" While Viagra can help when the problems are physiological, an impotent leader has lost his ability to govern. No little blue pill will dig him out of that hole. It can also allude to a certain meaninglessness, such as the music critic who wrote that the easy listening genre of pop was so dull as to be \"the soundtrack to impotence.\""
  },
  "mire": {
    "short": "A mire is mushy ground like quicksand, so if you feel yourself trapped in a sticky situation, consider yourself mired. One gets mired IN something — like in a dispute or in a love triangle.",
    "long": "Mire still has its original, though less-used, sense of a slushy, muddy bit of land that gives way underfoot, also known as a quagmire. One of the most famous mires in literary history was the one haunted by the Hound of the Baskervilles in Conan Doyle's classic. Have the fibs you told your beloved come back to haunt you? You're stuck in a mire then, a treacherous situation it's going to be pretty hard to squirm out of."
  },
  "stiff": {
    "short": "Stiff things don’t bend or move easily. Dead bodies and tree branches are often stiff, and your back might feel stiff if you sit for too long. But to stiff the wait staff is to skip the tip. Bad idea.",
    "long": "If a doorknob is stiff, it won't turn smoothly, and if the smile on your face is stiff, it’s frozen and unnatural looking. When a person is stiff, they are artificial and unrelaxed — unless they're \"scared stiff\" or \"bored stiff.\" A regular guy is a working stiff. Another colloquial meaning of stiff is \"to underpay, or to cheat.” Also, a stiff drink has a lot of alcohol. A dead body is sometimes called a stiff, but it’s rude."
  },
  "feud": {
    "short": "A feud is a long-standing fight, often between two families. In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare describes the lovers' long-feuding families, the Capulets and the Montagues.",
    "long": "Feuds do not have to be violent—what characterizes them is long-standing hostility. Ethnic groups can sometimes be said to be feuding. Kids in school who refuse to sit at the same lunch table over a period of years could describe their relationship as a feud."
  },
  "ford": {
    "short": "When you’re out hiking in the wilderness, you may have to ford a river if there’s no bridge. Roll up your pant legs because you'll have to wade through the water at a shallow point.",
    "long": "The verb ford describes crossing a body of water on foot at a shallow point or driving across it in a vehicle. The idea is that you’re not using a bridge or a boat to cross the water. Ford also has a noun form, meaning a shallow point in a river or stream. So if you ever have to ford a river, make sure you cross at the ford — the shallow point — or you could get very wet."
  },
  "ominous": {
    "short": "If something looks or sounds ominous, be careful: a threat or an unpleasant event is at hand. If you see an ominous frown on your boss's face, you're in trouble!",
    "long": "Ominous, and the related word omen both come from the 16th century Latin word ōmen \"foreboding.\" However, unlike omen, which is a sign of something good or bad to come, ominous always describes something unpleasant or threatening. If the future looks ominous, you've got nothing to look forward to. Figuratively, an ominous sky or ominous clouds promise rain or a storm."
  },
  "confluence": {
    "short": "Confluence means a flowing together. In a literal sense, it's about rivers. But it's more often used to talk about the coming together of factors or ideas, or of cultures in a diverse city.",
    "long": "Con- means \"with,\" and -fluence sounds like \"flow.\" When things come together like rivers do, flowing from entirely different places, you call that a confluence. If the senior class needs to raise money for a class trip, and the drama club is looking for someone to do concessions during intermission at the school play, that's a confluence of factors."
  },
  "pervasive": {
    "short": "When something is pervasive, it's everywhere. Common things are pervasive — like greed and cheap perfume.",
    "long": "Ever notice how certain trends seem to spread all over the place? When something — like a hairstyle — is super-common, it's pervasive. Pervasive things can't be escaped. Playing video games is pervasive among kids. Talking about the weather is pervasive among adults. Ideas, diseases, habits, and all sorts of things can be pervasive. If you're sick of seeing something because you're seeing it again and again, it must be pervasive."
  },
  "indigent": {
    "short": "An indigent person is extremely poor, lacking the basic resources of a normal life. Often the indigent lack not only money but homes.",
    "long": "Indigent comes from a Latin word meaning wanting, which we used to use to mean “lacking” and not just to describe desires. Homeless shelters, soup kitchens, free medical clinics and court-appointed lawyers are all institutions that our society has developed to help indigent people."
  },
  "frugality": {
    "short": "If you try to avoid waste by reusing and repurposing items that most people would throw away, your frugality will save you money.",
    "long": "Some people use this word interchangeably with cheapness, but cheapness is an unwillingness to spend, while frugality is an unwillingness to waste. People who show frugality often find ways of making things useful that others do not. Even after the Depression ended, those who lived through it maintained their frugality, using old t-shirts for rags and washed-out cottage cheese containers instead of Tupperware."
  },
  "criterion": {
    "short": "A criterion is a standard for judging something. If you are holding a cupcake competition, your number one criterion might be the smoothness of frosting.",
    "long": "A criterion is a category for judging, but can also be a prerequisite for an achievement. It might be an application requirement for a teaching job that you have taught already for two years. If you haven’t, then we say you haven’t \"met the criterion\" for job experience. Likewise, if you establish the model for something, say you deliver an exciting, profound graduation speech, we might say you \"set the criterion\" for future speakers."
  },
  "devour": {
    "short": "When you've gone all day without eating anything, you'll probably devour your dinner, especially if it's your very favorite homemade lasagna. Devour means to eat greedily and hungrily.",
    "long": "The meaning of devour has grown to include the consumption of things other than food. If you sit down to start a book and look up ten hours later having turned the last page, you have devoured that book. If your after school job devours all your free time, chances are your grades are going to drop. The Latin root, devorare, means \"to swallow down.\""
  },
  "inundate": {
    "short": "To inundate means to quickly fill up or overwhelm, just like a flood. Your bathroom could be inundated with water if the pipes burst, and hopefully your inbox is inundated with nice emails on your birthday.",
    "long": "Commonly used to refer to a deluge of water, inundate can also refer to an overflow of something less tangible, like information. Right before the holidays, toy stores are often inundated with eager parents scrambling to get the latest action figures and video games. Attempt to read the entire dictionary in one sitting and you'll inundate your mind with vocabulary. But you probably won't remember any of it tomorrow."
  },
  "genre": {
    "short": "A genre is a specific type of music, film, or writing. Your favorite literary genre might be science fiction, and your favorite film genre might be horror flicks about cheerleaders. Go figure.",
    "long": "In music, genre refers to musical style such as jazz, salsa or rock. In film or literature, the genre is determined by the subject, setting or plot of the story. When you are wandering around a book store, books are usually arranged by genre. Many genres, such as \"mystery\" or \"fantasy,\" overlap in film and literature, while others, such as \"romantic comedy\" in film or \"historical fiction\" in books, are specific to one or the other."
  },
  "omnivorous": {
    "short": "An omnivorous animal eats meat and plants — everything on the menu.",
    "long": "The word omnivorous wears its meaning on its sleeve: omni means \"all\" and vorare is \"to devour\" and it all comes together in the Latin word omnivorus — \"all-devouring.\" Rarr! Polar bears are omnivorous, while pandas are herbivorous (eat only plants). People love to say they're carnivorous (eat only meat) when they're probably really omnivorous (unless they really do kick the French fries off the plate every time). Since omnivorous means to \"devour everything,\" you can use it to describe someone with a very curious mind, who wants to \"devour\" everything with their brain, but not with their teeth."
  },
  "lament": {
    "short": "If you are really upset or sorry about something, you might lament it. A lament is full of regret and grief.",
    "long": "If you lament something, then you feel sorry about it. You could lament a mistake you made, or you could lament a horrible thing that happened to a friend. Also, a lament is an expression of grief. So if you keep saying how sorry you are about something, someone could say, \"Enough of your laments!\" There's also an old literary form called \"a lament,\" which expresses feelings of loss in a long dramatic poem."
  },
  "consummate": {
    "short": "Consummate means complete, finished, or masterful. If you refer to someone as a consummate chef, then you are saying he is the ultimate chef. If you say someone is a consummate jerk, then you are saying he is the ultimate jerk.",
    "long": "Consummate can be used to describe something good or bad: consummate joy, a consummate liar. To consummate means to bring something to completion, but it often refers specifically to making a marriage complete by having sexual relations. The adjective is pronounced KÄN-sə-mit, but the verb is pronounced KÄN-sə-māt."
  },
  "transience": {
    "short": "If your grandmother is always talking about how quickly the years go by, she is focused on life's transience, or briefness.",
    "long": "Summer's quality of seeming to be over just as it's started can be described as transience — anything that feels impossibly brief has that same attribute. People most often use the noun transience when they're talking about good things, like beautiful days, a nice life, or a fun vacation, that seem to be over in an instant. The word comes from the Latin transiens, \"passing over or away.\""
  },
  "hamstring": {
    "short": "Your hamstrings are groups of muscles and tendons between your hips and knees. If you pull a hamstring while running or jumping, you'll feel pain at the back of your thigh. Ouch!",
    "long": "The hamstring muscle group is one of the most powerful in your body — attached to the knee and hip, these are the muscles and tendons that make it possible for you to run, walk, and jump. It's fairly common for athletes to injure their hamstrings and be (temporarily) immobilized. Fittingly, hamstring is also a verb meaning \"render powerless.\" So an astronaut might complain that a lack of funding will hamstring NASA, making planned Mars voyages impossible."
  },
  "sibilant": {
    "short": "Something that’s sibilant has a hissing sound, like when the librarian says, “Shhhhhhhh!”",
    "long": "Sibilant entered English in the 17th century from the Latin word sibilant-, meaning “hissing.” When you listen to a foreign language that’s full of hissy “es” or “sh” or “zzz” sounds, those sounds are called sibilants. The sound is made by forcing air out toward your teeth. Try it: say “sash.” That’s a sibilant. As an adjective, use sibilant to describe something characterized by that hissing sound. Your sibilant whisper probably will be heard by the librarian."
  },
  "flop": {
    "short": "To flop is to drop or hang heavily and loosely. If you're exhausted at the end of the day, you might flop into a chair as soon as you walk into your house.",
    "long": "Your long hair might flop into your eyes, and if you catch a fish, you'll have to watch it flop around in your boat before it stops breathing. A tired child might begin to sob and flop onto the floor in frustration. You can also call a disaster a flop: \"We worked so hard on that play, but it turned out to be a total flop.\" The earliest meaning of flop was \"to flap.\""
  },
  "definite": {
    "short": "Definite is an adjective describing something that is known for certain. For example, there is no more definite way to get into trouble with a police officer than speeding in front of the police station with a broken taillight.",
    "long": "This word is from the Latin definitus meaning \"defined\" or \"limited.\" Definite can also be used to mean something is very clearly planned or certainly defined. If you have definite plans for the evening to go to the theater and out for a nice dinner at a steak house, you're probably not going to end up playing miniature golf and eating fast food instead."
  },
  "minutia": {
    "short": "The tiny details of anything can be called minutiae. Minutia — which you'll usually see as minutiae, the plural version — is a little like trivia.",
    "long": "Notice how minutia almost has the word mini in it? That's a good clue to the meaning, which is \"small things or details.\" People who are sports fans tend to love minutiae — like what a player's batting average is, right down to the third decimal point. Anytime you're dealing with itty-bitty details, you're looking at minutiae."
  },
  "concoct": {
    "short": "When you concoct something, you mix up different ingredients. If you want to become a mad scientist or a wizard, you'll have to learn how to concoct strange potions.",
    "long": "If the word concoction makes you think of steaming caldrons or liquids bubbling in test tubes, you’ll be amused to know that it comes from a Latin word for “digestion.” Yum!   On summer days, children sometimes concoct imaginative stews from grass, leaves and dirt. They may also concoct lies to explain why they tried feeding such concoctions to their little sister."
  },
  "altitude": {
    "short": "The noun altitude refers to how high something rises: “The high altitude of the Himalayan mountain range slowed the progress of the hikers.”",
    "long": "Whether it refers to how high a plane is flying or to the height of a landform, the word altitude is used to describe an object’s elevation above a particular reference point. Altitude is typically measured from sea level, which is the average level of the sea’s surface. Something that is far above sea level — such as Mount Everest — is said to have a high altitude. Something closer to the ground — such as a plane approaching for landing — is said to have a low altitude."
  },
  "discerning": {
    "short": "Discerning people pick up on subtle traits and are good judges of quality — they're the ones who can tell if your cupcakes are homemade from the finest ingredients or totally from a box mix.",
    "long": "Discerning is an adjective that comes from the Old French discerner, meaning to “distinguish (between), separate (by sifting)” — which makes sense, because someone with discerning tastes or a discerning eye is good at distinguishing the good from the bad and sifting out the gems from the junk. If you're an ace at picking out fabulous fabrics, accessories, and shoes when you get dressed each morning, you probably have discerning fashion sense."
  },
  "viscous": {
    "short": "Viscous means sticky, gluey and syrupy. So if something is viscous, you usually don't want to stick your fingers in it — that goes for boogers and maple syrup alike.",
    "long": "Not quite a solid and not quite a liquid, scientists like to say that viscous things don't flow very easily. They glop and slug around slowly, sticking to whatever they come in contact with. Think of making a batch of Rice Krispie treats: One minute the marshmallows are solid little rounds; the next minute they're melted into a web of sticky white goo that's somehow attached itself to the Rice Krispies, the spoon, the countertops, your nose, the front door, and the dog."
  },
  "sacred": {
    "short": "Something sacred is holy, devoted to a religious ceremony, or simply worthy of awe and respect. Jerusalem is a sacred place for many religions, just as Fenway is a sacred place for Red Sox fans.",
    "long": "Sacred is an adjective used to describe a person or thing worthy of worship or declared holy. It usually appears in a religious context, but an object or place set aside for a particular purpose can also be sacred. Sacred spaces and items are intended to be treated with care and respect — even if it's just your shrine to Brad Pitt."
  },
  "isolate": {
    "short": "When you remove or set apart one thing from others, you isolate it. You could isolate yourself  from people by living in a remote hut or, if you're a biologist, you could isolate a chromosome.",
    "long": "The verb isolate comes from the adjective isolated, which comes from the Latin insulatas, meaning “made into an island.” You may have heard the John Donne quote, “No man is an island.” Donne was claiming that no matter how much you might try to isolate yourself from the rest of humanity, in the end people are all connected to one another. Humanity’s need for connectedness may, in fact, be illustrated by the fact that jailers frequently isolate criminals as punishment."
  },
  "pecuniary": {
    "short": "If something has to do with money, it's pecuniary.  If your grandfather's antique watch has pecuniary value, it's worth money — you could sell it for cash if you weren't sentimentally attached to keeping it.",
    "long": "Pecuniary might seem like a peculiar word for talking about money, but it all adds up when you learn that it was the worth of the cattle, or pecū in Latin, that gave pecuniary its meaning. In Roman times, livestock served as money in making transactions. Some cultures still have economies based on cattle, but most modern societies have a pecuniary system based on, well, money."
  },
  "tenable": {
    "short": "If your teacher says your position on the benefits of abolishing homework is not tenable, she means it is not based in fact. To be tenable is to be evidence-based and well-founded.",
    "long": "Tenable comes from the Latin root tenir which means \"to hold,\" as in \"hold together.\" If your plan is tenable, it will probably hold together when you execute it, or hold up to scrutiny. It's good to note that the opposite of tenable is untenable and not intenable, though throughout history both have been used."

  "sophistication": {
    "short": "Sophistication is the quality that belongs to a person who appears wise and glamorous. Sipping tea and appreciating opera are both stereotypical signs of sophistication.",
    "long": "The noun sophistication can also be used in a slightly different way, to describe a deep understanding, or an almost enlightened state. Before the 1800s, sophistication meant \"the use of sophistry,\" or using mistaken or deceitful arguments, although the root word for both sophistication and \"sophistry\" is the Greek sophistes, or \"wise man.\""
  },
  "precedent": {
    "short": "A precedent is something that sets a standard for future events. It's hard to say what the legal community would do without the word precedent, since so many legal judgments and decisions are based on what came before.",
    "long": "Lawyers and judges often look for a precedent that can be used as a guide for a similar case. This word is used elsewhere too. Your mom might not let you stay up late because it would set a bad precedent for future bedtimes. A teacher who lets kids chew gum is setting a precedent that gum-chewing will be OK in the future. People often refer to a precedent later on as a reference point for how things should be."
  },
  "bisect": {
    "short": "When you cut something in half or in two pieces, you bisect it. You can bisect a cupcake so that you and a friend get equal pieces.",
    "long": "In Latin, bi means \"two\" and secare means \"to cut.\" That's why the verb bisect means \"divide into two equal pieces.\" You might bisect your garden, planting half with vegetables and half with flowers, or tape a line on your bedroom floor to bisect the space into two sides — yours and your horrible sister's. In geometry, the word bisect means the same thing, to split something into equal halves."
  },
  "assemble": {
    "short": "To assemble means to bring together, as in people or parts. The volunteers assembled to assemble the bikes for the needy kids.",
    "long": "The U.S. Constitution guarantees in something in the Bill of Rights called \"the right of assembly.\" This means that people are allowed to come together for any purpose they chose. In countries without this right, groups who assemble can be disbanded with the idea that they may be assembling a revolution."
  },
  "fathom": {
    "short": "To fathom something is to understand it thoroughly. It's usually used in the negative, as in \"I can't fathom why he doesn't want to go along with us.\"",
    "long": "Fathom is from Middle English fadme, from Old English fæthm, \"outstretched arms.\" The Old English and modern English noun also refers to a unit of length used to measure the depth of water. The sense of intellectual depth comes from that meaning — to understand or fathom something thoroughly is \"to get to the bottom of it.\""
  },
  "precocious": {
    "short": "That high school hoops phenom who plays like an NBA pro? The sixth grader who's already asking questions about organic chemistry? They're both precocious — meaning they're way beyond their years in skill or knowledge.",
    "long": "When you look at the Latin roots of precocious, it all makes sense. When pre (meaning \"before\") joins coquere (meaning \"to ripen\"), you have something that is ripening prematurely. And in the case of precocious, you are usually describing young people who have some adult-like quality about them. Maybe it's their vast vocabulary, maybe it's their ease with Calculus, or maybe it's just applying lipstick."
  },
  "pernicious": {
    "short": "Pernicious means harmful and subtle, such as a poison gas that causes illness in those exposed to it over the course of years.",
    "long": "Pernicious comes from the Latin perniciosus, \"destructive,\" which in turn comes from pernicies, \"death\" or \"ruin.\" You might have heard your parents and teachers talk about the pernicious effects of watching too much TV and playing video games all day — they'll turn your brain to mush (allegedly)."
  },
  "formative": {
    "short": "Formative is a word that describes something that made you who you are. You might call your adolescence your formative years because that time period had such a strong influence on the rest of your life.",
    "long": "The word form means “to shape.” Something that is formative is capable of shaping or molding something or someone. A formative experience is one that strongly influenced you, like the first time you went to the beach and decided, from that day, that you wanted to become a world-class surfer. Formative can also describe an organism that is able to form new cells. In linguistics, the noun formative is a small language unit that can help shape or form a word."
  },
  "modicum": {
    "short": "If you want to describe a small amount of something, try modicum. If you have a modicum of interest in something, you are a little bit interested.",
    "long": "Modicum comes from the Latin modicus, for moderate, and modus, for measure. We often use it to mean \"any at all,\" as if \"If you had a modicum of sense (i.e. any sense at all), you'd be able to see that the pencil you've spent the last five minutes looking for is tucked behind your ear.\""
  },
  "tawdry": {
    "short": "Tawdry means cheap, shoddy, or tasteless. It can be used to describe almost anything from clothes to people to even events or affairs.",
    "long": "You know that shiny black slip you picked up for nothing at a garage sale and used as the skirt of your lion-tamer Halloween costume? It's a bit tawdry. But it would really be tawdry if you wore it on a regular day out. Tawdry things often have a hint of desperation and immorality — like tawdry extramarital affairs or tawdry tales. With tawdry decorations and jewelry, quality has been exchanged for lots of flash and shine."
  },
  "impressive": {
    "short": "Something that is impressive stands out because it is really good. Some of the most impressive college application essays are those that reflect on past events that shaped who the writer is today.",
    "long": "When you impress someone, you show that you are special or that what you did is praiseworthy. So something that's impressive does just that, like the impressive feat of running a marathon every week for a year. The earliest meaning of impressive was \"capable of being easily impressed,\" from the Latin word impressus, \"imprint or stamp.\" By around 1775, the meaning had changed to \"making a strong impression on.\""
  },
  "parasite": {
    "short": "A creature that lives off another organism is a parasite. The parasite might not hurt the host, but it doesn't do anything to help it, either.",
    "long": "If you call someone a parasite, you are really hurling an insult! The Ancient Greeks used the word parasitos to describe someone who ate at your table but never invited you back. Some telling synonyms include leech,\" toady, sponge, and hanger-on.\" Nice, huh? Some crafty birds, such as the cowbird or cuckoo, are called social parasites, laying their eggs in other birds' nests and expecting those mamas to raise their young for them. Unfortunately, there are some people like that, too."
  },
  "aloof": {
    "short": "Someone who's aloof isn't warm and friendly, instead being distant and reserved. That emotionally cold and detached fellow who keeps to himself, drinking espresso and reading French philosophy, would best be described as aloof.",
    "long": "In Middle English, aloof was originally a nautical term; the loof (now spelled luff) is the windward side of a ship. Smart sailors wanting to avoid a hazard on the leeward side would give the order, \"A loof!\" From this command we get the idea of steering clear of something (or someone). In modern usage the word has taken on a negative connotation: an aloof person is often considered cold or snobby."
  },
  "rebound": {
    "short": "To rebound is to come back from a slump. You might rebound from an illness, or your country might rebound from an economic recession.",
    "long": "Like many words that start with the prefix re, rebound involves something happening again. In this case, to rebound is to bounce back to a previous state or condition. If you gain 20 pounds and then lose it, you rebound. If the stock market crashes and then returns to a healthy level, it rebounds."
  },
  "befuddle": {
    "short": "To befuddle is to confuse. A sticky exam question can befuddle you, or an awkward question about your whereabouts the night before (how can you remember? You were befuddled, after all.)",
    "long": "In sixteenth century Britain a popular thing to do (about the only thing to do) after the hogs had been fed and the chickens put away for the night was fuddle — in other words get pretty drunk. Befuddled was simply the confused state too many pots of mead put your poor brain in, and that's still its basic meaning today. Nowadays, befuddle has a more general meaning of confusion and uncertainty not necessarily caused by too much booze."
  },
  "homily": {
    "short": "A homily is a sermon or religious speech offering encouragement or moral correction. Isn’t it strange how sometimes, when you're struggling with something, a preacher comes on TV giving a homily on that same problem?! Too bad it happens when you do bad stuff, too.",
    "long": "In many churches and lecture halls, a homily is just a short message on a religious topic or moral issue that's meant to encourage those who hear it. Another type of homily, though, is one that's judgmental or condemning. If you hear a homily and feel better afterward, even if it delivers hard truths about right and wrong, you've heard an uplifting homily. One that leaves you mad and frustrated, however, might make you need another homily on forgiveness and self-control."

  "nigh": {
    "short": "Nigh is an old-fashioned word that can be used as an adjective or adverb to mean near or nearly. Something that is nigh impossible — like knitting a sweater in one night — will be very difficult to accomplish.",
    "long": "As an adjective, nigh is an older form of the word \"near,\" both of which are rooted in the Old English word neah. People like to use the word nigh when they talk about the apocalypse: \"Repent! The end is nigh.\" It's most common to use nigh today when you're trying to sound poetic or referencing the archaic or biblical uses of the word."

  "stereotype": {
    "short": "A stereotype is a preconceived notion, especially about a group of people. Many stereotypes are rooted in prejudice — so you should be wary of them.",
    "long": "You have probably heard stereotypes: commonly held ideas or preconceptions about specific groups. You most often hear about negative stereotypes, but some are positive — the stereotype that tall people are good at basketball, for example. One of many problems with any stereotype is that even if it's true in some cases, it's certainly not true in all cases."

  "heretical": {
    "short": "Something that departs from normally held beliefs (especially religious, political, or social norms) is heretical. If your family is resistant to change, they may consider your idea of making pancakes for dinner to be completely heretical.",
    "long": "Heretical is the adjective form of the noun heretic, which comes from the Greek word hairetikos, meaning able to choose. What is considered a heretical point of view can change over time. Examples of positions that were once considered heretical but are now accepted as facts include: the Earth is round, the Earth circles the Sun, and a little bit of chocolate is actually good for you."
  },
  "husbandry": {
    "short": "Husbandry has nothing to do with being a husband, and a lot to do with being a farmer. If you cultivate the land or breed animals, you are practicing husbandry.",
    "long": "Long before husbands were hen-pecked guys who cut the grass on weekends and played with the kiddies after school, they were robust men of the Earth — farmers, in other words. That meaning died out, but its current meaning survives as a remnant of it. Today, you most often hear of \"crop husbandry\", which refers to raising crops; however, if you practice toad husbandry — you must be raising toads."
  },
  "encrypt": {
    "short": "To encrypt is to convert regular language into a code. Encrypting is a way of keeping secrets.",
    "long": "Encrypting is a way of disguising a written message so that most people won't understand it. Encrypting puts a message into a code that will appear to be gibberish. Only someone who knows the code or is an expert in breaking codes — like a cryptographer — will be able to read something encrypted. People don't encrypt their laundry lists or term papers; communications that get encrypted are top secret info, like government reports and messages from spies."
  },
  "inordinate": {
    "short": "Something that's excessive or that goes way beyond normal limits is inordinate — like an overly obsessive love for chocolate or a fantasy football junkie who spends an inordinate amount of time checking his team.",
    "long": "The adjective inordinate is the exact opposite of \"reasonable\" and \"moderate.\" In fact, when you call something inordinate, you're saying it's downright exorbitant and out of proportion. It's often used to describe abnormal amounts of time spent doing something — playing video games at work or canoodling with your girlfriend at school, for example. But as Oscar Wilde once said, “An inordinate passion for pleasure is the secret of remaining young.”"
  },
  "eternal": {
    "short": "If something lasts forever or even if it just feels like it’s going to last forever, you could call it eternal, which means that it goes on and on and will never change or end.",
    "long": "The Fountain of Youth is a mythical spring of water that rewards its bathers with eternal life, free from sickness and death forever.  The Latin root of eternal is aeternalis, translating roughly as “of great age,” and  eternal things are really, really old.  Eternal can describe an abstract idea that never changes, like the eternal truths of war, or it can describe an annoyance that you wish would end, like the eternal boredom you feel watching a really dull movie."
  },
  "posture": {
    "short": "Posture is the way you position your body or arrange your limbs. So stand up straight, put your shoulders back, and lift that chin up.",
    "long": "Ballerinas have an elegant, graceful posture, and soldiers tend to display a rigid, strong posture. If you sit hunched over your desk every day you'll end up with terrible posture. This noun describes the way you carry yourself, but can also describe a certain body position you take, like the different postures in yoga. If you're accused of posturing though, that's a different story — that means you're behaving unnaturally to impress someone."
  },
  "ignominious": {
    "short": "Losing a football game stinks, but losing a game where, at the end, you are lying face down in a puddle of mud and the fans are burning effigies of you in the streets? That is an ignominious defeat.",
    "long": "Although ignominious can modify other words, it is nearly always attached to \"defeat.\" It derives from the word ignominy, which means public shame or defeat. Ignominy derives from the Latin in- \"not\" + a variant of nomen \"name.\""
  },
  "disparate": {
    "short": "The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old clothes, rotting food, and possibly a missing relative. Disparate things are very different from each other.",
    "long": "Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is from Latin disparātus, from disparāre \"to separate, divide,\" from the prefix dis- \"apart\" plus parāre \"to prepare.\" Disparate in the sense of \"very different\" probably developed by association with the Latin adjective dispar \"unequal, different.\""
  },
  "incentive": {
    "short": "If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she might offer to treat you to ice cream after as an incentive. An incentive is something that stimulates you to take action or work harder.",
    "long": "This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin incentivum, from incentivus, \"stimulating.\" In Latin, incentivus meant \"setting the tune,\" from incinere, \"to sing.\" The related English verb is incentivize. The less common verb incent was first used in the early 1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon."
  },
  "loquacious": {
    "short": "A loquacious person talks a lot, often about stuff that only they think is interesting. You can also call them chatty or gabby, but either way, they're loquacious.",
    "long": "Whenever you see the Latin loqu-, you can be sure that the word has something to do with \"talking.\" So a loquacious person is a person who talks a lot, and often too much. Sitting next to a loquacious person at a dinner party can make dinner a real drag. Of course, if you've got nothing to say, a loquacious person might make a good dinner companion, because they'll do all the talking. All you will have to do is smile and eat."
  },
  "hiatus": {
    "short": "A temporary gap, pause, break, or absence can be called a hiatus. When your favorite TV show is on hiatus, that means there are no new episodes — not forever, just for a little while.",
    "long": "Even things that go on for a long time take a break once in a while: one kind of break is a hiatus. If someone has to leave her job for a time, she's going on hiatus. A touring band will need to take a hiatus if the lead singer gets in an accident. The key thing about a hiatus is that it's an interruption of something that was happening, but it's not a permanent break."
  },
  "cosmopolitan": {
    "short": "Your Aunt Eleanor, who's lived in six different countries and speaks four languages fluently, might be described as cosmopolitan, or comfortable and familiar with different cultures and people.",
    "long": "People who are cosmopolitan have an air of glamour surrounding them, a sense that they've seen a lot of the world and are sophisticated and at ease with all different kinds of people. Places can also be described as cosmopolitan, meaning \"diverse,\" or bustling with lots of people of varying nationalities. Any way you use it, cosmopolitan implies a sophistication, which might explain why both a well-known alcoholic cocktail and a famous women's magazine are both named after the word cosmopolitan."
  },
  "subvert": {
    "short": "When you subvert something, your words or actions criticize or undermine the usual way of doing something or common values. The girl who wears a tuxedo to the prom might subvert traditional ideas about beauty.",
    "long": "To subvert an institution like a school or a government is to overthrow it or stop its normal way of functioning. Subvert comes from the Latin word subvertere, which combines the prefix sub, under, and the suffix vertere, to turn. So you can imagine something that subverts as overturning or flipping the usual way of doing things, like a student who subverts a teacher's authority, causing chaos in the classroom."
  },
  "apostle": {
    "short": "Although an apostle might be a pioneering supporter of any new cause, the word is most often used to refer to the twelve original disciples of Jesus who went on to spread the gospel. When used as a title, it’s capitalized.",
    "long": "The Greek word apóstolos means \"one who is sent out,\" giving it a proper connection with the word apostle. The word’s original English meaning of \"messenger\" referred to the followers of Jesus. The modern meaning can be more secular, with the word appropriately being applied to any leader breaking new ground or supporting an important new idea.  As an apostle of the latest developments in good nutrition, you were outraged at the sight of french fries.  Clearly, you had no choice but to make them disappear."
  },
  "fractious": {
    "short": "If you're prone to picking fights, making snarky comments, and being frustratingly stubborn, you're fractious. And odds are you're not invited to too many parties.",
    "long": "Someone who is fractious is cranky, rebellious and inclined to cause problems. Tempers and children are commonly described as such. In To Kill A Mockingbird, author Harper Lee uses the word to describe the trouble-making Calpurnia: \"She had always been too hard on me, she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways, she was sorry and too stubborn to say so.\""
  },
  "disabuse": {
    "short": "Disabuse means to free someone of a belief that is not true. Many teachers of health find that when they teach, they spend as much energy disabusing kids of false beliefs as they do giving them the facts.",
    "long": "Disabuse is often connected to the word notion or idea. In singing lessons, you must disabuse young singers of the idea that they can sing better by singing louder. In the first year of college, many people are disabused of the notion that their experiences are universal — by meeting so many people who have had different experiences or come from different backgrounds."
  },
  "vehemence": {
    "short": "Something with vehemence is forceful and energetic. If you passionately believe that your neighbor is mistreating his dog, speak to him with vehemence.",
    "long": "Vehemence is the quality of being vehement, or powerful. We often describe passionate speeches as having vehemence. You could also describe a violent natural event as vehement. A hurricane sweeps onto coastal land with destructive vehemence. If your dancing style is wild and involves throwing your limbs every which way as fast as possible, then you dance with vehemence."
  },
  "unintelligent": {
    "short": "Unintelligent means exactly what it sounds like it means––not intelligent, not smart. Your unintelligent dog might not know his own name, but you love him for his goofy sweetness anyway.",
    "long": "Don't confuse unintelligent with unintelligible. Unintelligible means something that can't be understood. Some doctors have handwriting so messy as to be considered unintelligible, but that doesn't mean they're unintelligent. If your cell phone signal is weak, you might find that what your mom is telling you on the phone becomes unintelligible to you — but that doesn't make you unintelligent."
  },
  "mendicant": {
    "short": "People who live off begging can be called mendicants. However, you probably wouldn't call your kids mendicants, even though they beg you for stuff, because the word mendicant also implies extreme poverty.",
    "long": "The noun mendicant can also refer to a man belonging to a religious order, such as the Franciscan Friars — who do not own personal property but live together in a monastery and survive off alms donated by others. As an adjective, mendicant describes someone who lives such an existence."
  },
  "rebellious": {
    "short": "A rebellious person likes to challenge authority and break the rules every now and then. A really rebellious group tries to overthrow the government.",
    "long": "Being rebellious is part of the American character. If the colonies hadn't been rebellious enough to rebel against England, there would be no United States. Large groups of people can be rebellious, but so can individuals. A student who talks back to the teacher is being rebellious. An employee who ignores a dress code is being rebellious. Anywhere there's an authority, someone is probably acting rebellious toward it."
  },
  "avuncular": {
    "short": "Everyone likes an avuncular guy, that is someone who is kind and patient and generally indulgent with people younger than he is. The Dalai Lama is an avuncular fellow. So is Santa Claus. Unless you haven't been good.",
    "long": "The word avuncular originally comes from the Latin avunculus, meaning \"maternal uncle,\" and strictly speaking the term describes the relationship between an uncle and his nephew. Uncles, by their very definition, are supposed to be avuncular to their nephews. For many uncles though, Santa Claus is pretty hard to compete with."
  },
  "magnate": {
    "short": "If you’re a hugely successful businessperson, particularly if you’ve cornered the market in a specific area, you’re a magnate. Magnates are often larger-than-life characters, like that oil tycoon who wears a cowboy hat with his tuxedo.",
    "long": "Historically, a magnate was a man of noble birth (from the Latin magnus, meaning \"a nobleman,\" or at least someone distinguished by his achievements. In the twentieth century, the stock of a magnate has rather fallen. If you’re vulgar and loud-spoken as well as rich, you’re probably a magnate. Thanks to the legendary movie producer Samuel Goldwyn, all film studio heads are now \"studio magnates.\""
  },
  "rotundity": {
    "short": "When you talk about the rotundity, or roundness, of a voice, you're talking about how full-bodied and easily heard it is.  The rotundity of a person is how round they are in the belly. Any 3D object that has a roundness to it can be described in terms of its rotundity.",
    "long": "The word rotundity comes from the Latin rotundus meaning \"round, circular, wheel-like.\" A rotunda is a circular building with a dome over it. The rotundity or roundness of its structure is what gives it its name.  The rotundity of an opera singer's voice is what allows her song to carry and fill a room. The rotundity of Santa Claus' belly is part of what makes him the jolly character we love so much."
  },
  "ordinary": {
    "short": "Something ordinary is something that happens every day. Maybe you should skip your ordinary breakfast and try something new.",
    "long": "Although we often use the adjective ordinary to mean \"ho-hum, nothing special,\" it actually comes from the Latin root for \"rule.\" You could think of ordinary things as almost like rules in your life. As a noun it has other meanings. In heraldry (that's the art of the family shield), an ordinary is a conventional figure. A probate judge is called an ordinary, as is the clergyman who prepares prisoners for death."
  },
  "perfidious": {
    "short": "If someone accuses you of being perfidious, you should probably be offended — it means underhanded, treacherous, deceitful — even evil.",
    "long": "If you betray people often, you're perfidious: traitors are extremely perfidious. Besides betrayal, this word implies lying and maybe other kinds of awful behavior, like stealing and taking bribes. Everyone tries to avoid perfidious people. Perfidious is kind of an old-fashioned word, but being perfidious will never go out of style, unfortunately."
  },
  "genome": {
    "short": "The human genome is the map of your DNA, the double helix that contains all your genes. Your genome is all the genetic material contained in your 23 pairs of chromosomes, a total of more than 20,000 genes.",
    "long": "Every organism has its own unique genome. \"The Human Genome Project,\" completed in 2003, was an international effort to identify all the genes in human DNA and to determine the sequences of the 3 billion (yes, billion) base pairs — the smaller units that make up DNA. It took 13 years. Genome research has helped diagnose disease and find genetic markers for certain diseases."
  },
  "congregate": {
    "short": "Congregate is a verb that means to come together, to assemble, or to gather. At school dances, you may congregate with your friends, because you get nervous in front of kids you don't know very well.",
    "long": "Congregate comes from Latin root words com, meaning \"together\" and gregare, meaning \"to gather in a flock.\" Congregation, or a gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does gregarious, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to socialize. If you remember the key word is flock — what ministers often call their congregations — you should have no trouble remembering congregate means to flock together."
  },
  "inhumane": {
    "short": "The adjective inhumane means cruel and heartless. Use it to describe terrible things like your neighbor's inhumane treatment of his hound dogs, which he leaves tied up in the yard in all kinds of weather.",
    "long": "Whenever someone acts without considering the discomfort or pain of another person or animal, you can describe their actions as inhumane. A cruel government that keeps prisoners in terrible conditions is inhumane, and the treatment of farm animals is in some cases revealed to be inhumane by investigators. The word inhumane was originally a synonym of inhuman, literally \"not human,\" but it fell out of use and then was revived in the 1820s to mean the opposite of humane."
  },
  "olfactory": {
    "short": "Something olfactory has to do with the sense of smell. The odor from that factory is a symphony of olfactory delights. Not.",
    "long": "Though we typically think of dogs as the olfactory champions of the world, what with their remarkable ability to sniff out practically anything, the true title belongs to the polar bear. Healthy, adult polar bears possess olfactory gifts that boggle the mind: they can smell a seal under the ice from over a kilometer away. One way to try to remember the meaning of the word olfactory is to think of factory. Your nose is the \"factory\" where odors are processed. What visual is to the eyes, olfactory is to the nose."
  },
  "aristocratic": {
    "short": "The word aristocratic describes a person at the highest level of society — such as a prince or a duchess — or those people or things that are so distinguished that they seem to belong to that group.",
    "long": "First used around the 1560s, the adjective aristocratic has origins in the Greek word aristokratia, meaning \"government, rule of the best.\"  An aristocratic person usually gains this social status through birthright rather than demonstrated merit. Aristocratic can describe someone or something belonging to this group, like an aristocratic estate or an aristocratic leader, but it can also describe something grand and elegant. You might have an aristocratic expression on your face as you attend a formal party."
  },
  "recourse": {
    "short": "Recourse is a source of help.   If you're failing trigonometry in spite of studying until your brain hurts, you may have no recourse but to hire a tutor.",
    "long": "Recourse comes from the Latin word recursus, meaning “to run back or retreat.” People seek recourse from such difficulties as debt, illness and legal woes, so you can think of recourse as the words \"retreating from curses\" squished together.  For the record, though, the cursus in recursus means course, not curse. Actually, no one knows where the word curse comes from.  There may be some connection between cursus and curses, but then again, there may not be."
  },
  "heretic": {
    "short": "If your friend became interested in Hinduism, with its many gods and rituals, her Catholic mother might be worried that her daughter was a heretic, or a person whose religious beliefs are in contrast to the fundamental beliefs of her church.",
    "long": "The noun heretic is mostly used in a religious context to talk about someone whose actions or beliefs act against the laws, rules, or beliefs of some specific religion. However, heretic can also be used in a non-religious way to mean \"someone whose ideas go against the norm.\" Say your regular hangout is a cowboy honky-tonk and most of your friends play in country bands; you might be considered a heretic if you announced that your favorite kind of music is actually opera."
  },
  "tedious": {
    "short": "If something is tedious, it's boring. If you're anxious to get outside and enjoy the sun, even the best lecture will seem tedious.",
    "long": "Tedious is the adjective from tedium, which is both Latin and English for boredom. You ordinarily wouldn't use tedious for people, just things; you might say \"His speeches are tedious,\" but usually not \"He is tedious.\" Something that is tedious could also be called tiresome. Shakespeare's Friar Laurence says \"I will be brief, for my short date of breath / Is not so long as is a tedious tale.\""
  },
  "conformity": {
    "short": "If all your friends wear jeans to school and you wear checkered slacks, you could say you reject conformity — doing the same thing as everyone else.",
    "long": "Conformity usually refers to people's behavior or looks, but it can also be used to describe something that matches the form of something else — for example, a one-story house built in conformity to the low-slung buildings that surround it.  It's common for conformity to follow the word in."
  },
  "momentary": {
    "short": "Something that lasts for a very short time is momentary. A flash of lightning is momentary, since it blazes across the sky for only a second or two.",
    "long": "Use the adjective momentary when you want to describe something brief or fleeting, like a momentary pause in a speech or a momentary flash of insight that pops into your head and disappears. If it lasts just a moment, it's momentary. The root word is the Latin momentarius, \"of brief duration,\" which in turn comes from momentum, \"short time, or instant.\""
  },
  "waspish": {
    "short": "If someone is acting irritable or crabby, you can describe them as waspish. Your sister's waspish complaints about dinner aren't likely to convince your dad to order pizza for her instead.",
    "long": "This adjective comes from the word wasp and the notion that wasps are spiteful and ill-tempered, stinging petulantly when they feel cranky. If someone calls you waspish, that's what they mean — you're easily irritated. It's less common than it once was (waspish has been used since at least the mid-1500s), but it's still a great way to describe anyone who's quick to express their anger."
  },
  "adequate": {
    "short": "When you want to say that something is enough or good enough for a particular need, use the adjective adequate. You might have an adequate amount of flour for a batch of pancakes, but not a lot extra.",
    "long": "Adequate can also describe something that is acceptable or satisfactory, but not any better than that. You might say that a student's grades are adequate but need improvement. This word is from Latin adaequāre\"to make equal,\" from the prefix ad- plus aequare \"to equal.\""
  },
  "fixate": {
    "short": "If you fixate on something, you become overly focused on it or attached to it. Don't fixate on your grades — try to enjoy the process of learning!",
    "long": "While the original 19th century meaning of fixate was \"make stable,\" it soon came to mean \"gaze upon.\" It was Sigmund Freud who shifted the definition to something more obsessive. His theories of psychoanalysis included the concept of fixation, an unhealthy attachment to something or someone — and fixate followed. You can fixate on small things (like a stain on your sweater) or big things (like world poverty)."
  },
  "inflict": {
    "short": "When you force an undesirable or harmful event on someone, you inflict it on them. You might prefer that someone inflict some physical pain on you rather than inflict you with the boredom of another trip to the annual flower show.",
    "long": "The verb inflict comes from the Latin word inflictus, meaning “to strike or dash against.” If you cause anything bad to happen to a person, animal, or even an object, you inflict that badness on them. For example, someone can inflict injuries or suffering on other people or inflict damage on property. We can inflict pollution or over-development on our environment. It's always a negative thing — you wouldn't say you inflict happiness or love on others."
  },
  "extent": {
    "short": "The extent is the area something covers. That could be physical space or something like being prosecuted to the full extent of the law.",
    "long": "Use the word extent when you are discussing how far something extends — how far it reaches. If you're an expert, the extent of your knowledge is wide. If you own a lot of property, the extent of your land is huge. The full extent of something is like the limit — that's the end of it. If you've reached the extent of your patience, you're out of patience. If an earthquake destroyed your house, the extent of the damage was severe."
  },
  "compare": {
    "short": "To compare is to look at two things and see how they are similar and different.",
    "long": "People compare all the time. If you look at two products and compare prices, you're looking for the better bargain. It is hard to compare who was the better athlete, Michael Jordan or Billie Jean King, because they played different sports. At a museum, you can compare different paintings. If you like your math teacher better than your history teacher, you're comparing the two. If a TV shows is bad, you could say \"it doesn't compare\" to your favorite show."
  },
  "preternatural": {
    "short": "Preternatural describes something that seems oddly abnormal and out of sync with everything else. If you hear a preternatural dog's barking, maybe it sounds like a police siren instead of a howl.",
    "long": "Note that preternatural contains the word natural. Preter comes from the Latin word praeter which means \"beyond\"; so something preternatural is beyond nature. It is less commonly used than unnatural or supernatural but means the same thing. If you lift a truck off the ground and hold it above your head, people will marvel at you and say you have preternatural strength."
  },
  "beget": {
    "short": "To beget means to generate something, usually children, and it can be used to refer to the role of either a mother or a father.",
    "long": "If we analyze the word beget, we get the prefix be-, which tends to intensify the meaning of the following verb, and get, which means to cause something to enter one's possession. The word is usually used to refer to having children, although it can be used to refer to anything that generates something else — for example, an inspiration can beget a brilliant idea."
  },
  "overwrought": {
    "short": "High in drama and lacking any emotional restraint, overwrought is an adjective that means deeply, excessively agitated or nervous.",
    "long": "Say your favorite soap star gets killed off in episode 12. If you sob uncontrollably, tear at your hair, and refuse to leave the couch for a week, most would say your response was overwrought — in other words, a bit much. But it's not just emotions that can go over the top. The gaudy, golden McMansion covered in ornate Italian statuary where your soap star lives in real life? Totally overdone, or overwrought, with details."
  },
  "discourse": {
    "short": "If you use the word discourse, you are describing a formal and intense discussion or debate.",
    "long": "The noun discourse comes from the Latin discursus to mean \"an argument.\" But luckily, that kind of argument does not mean people fighting or coming to blows. The argument in discourse refers to an exchange of ideas — sometimes heated — that often follows a kind of order and give-and-take between the participants. It's the kind of argument and discussion that teachers love, so discourse away!"
  },
  "hitherto": {
    "short": "Use the adverb hitherto when you're describing a state or circumstance that existed up until now. If you find a hitherto undiscovered hidden tunnel in your cellar, you're the first to discover it.",
    "long": "When some particular situation has existed so far, up until the moment that you're speaking of, you can use the word hitherto to talk about it. You could say that you're taking a hot air balloon ride that you were hitherto too scared to contemplate, or that a very shy girl in your philosophy class who was hitherto totally silent finally spoke up today and asked a very intelligent question."
  },
  "quaff": {
    "short": "To quaff is to gulp. You’re in a desert; you haven’t had water in days; you’re wicked thirsty. Then you find an oasis! You lean over and quaff the water.",
    "long": "If you’re in a room with your favorite foods, you might stuff the food into your mouth.  Quaffing is the same fun, but with beverages instead of foods.  But just like with stuffing food, quaffing means you drink a little too much. Often, quaffing refers to alcoholic drinks, but it can mean any beverage in general, like milkshakes.  Quaff a milkshake and you’ll get a headache, but you’ll have fun doing it."
  },
  "vertigo": {
    "short": "If you're standing still but the room is inexplicably spinning, you might want to let someone know you're suffering from vertigo — the sensation of dizziness or whirling.",
    "long": "Contrary to popular belief, vertigo is not exactly the same thing as acrophobia, the fear of heights. However, acrophobia can result in the symptoms associated with vertigo. Interestingly, when legendary director Alfred Hitchcock created a film about a detective with an intense fear of heights, he named the film Vertigo, not Acrophobia; perhaps he thought Vertigo was catchier."
  },
  "judicious": {
    "short": "If you're judicious, you've got a good head on your shoulders and make good decisions. Humpty Dumpty's decision to sit on a wall? NOT judicious.",
    "long": "As its sound implies, judicious comes from the same Latin word from which we get judge and judiciary, and not surprisingly a judicious decision is one that only comes after all sides have been weighed up and opposing points of view taken into consideration. Judicious decisions are never split-second decisions."
  },
  "feral": {
    "short": "When animal control finds a feral dog, they have to handle it very carefully because the animal is so wild that it's probably afraid of humans and likely to bite.",
    "long": "Feral is often used to describe a wild, untamed animal, like the feral cat with its claws and sharp teeth menacingly bared, ready to strike. Qualities that are similar to a wild animal can also be called feral. The child who grew alone up in a cabin in the woods, and who didn't go to school, was called feral when she ran away from the orphanage."
  },
  "accolade": {
    "short": "A knight being honored with the tap of a sword-blade was the earliest form of accolade. Today, an accolade is more than a way to bestow knighthood, it is a form of praise or an award.",
    "long": "In the early 17th century, the French accoler meant to \"embrace the neck,\" which was done as part of a knighthood ceremony. By the 19th century, accolade came to mean \"award.\" A person who achieves a goal in research or service may receive an official paper certificate or trophy, an accolade of achievement, while a performer or speaker might get an accolade in the form of applause from the audience. Rarely does either of these types of accolade involve a sword."
  },
  "extravagant": {
    "short": "Extravagant is an adjective that means expensive, excessive, and over the top. A modest chandelier in your dining room is normal. But crystal-studded walls and gold-plated goblets? That's a bit extravagant.",
    "long": "If you’re prone to lavish behavior or spending, you’re extravagant. It’s an adjective associated with extremes, sometimes even to the point of absurdity. Fees at a bank can be extravagant, and so can a person who insists on drinking only bottled French mineral water out of a golden chalice. Remember that the only ‘e’ is at the beginning — the remaining three vowels are all ‘a.’"
  },
  "fanciful": {
    "short": "Turn fanciful around and you get \"full of fancy,\" which gives you the gist of the meaning. The adjective refers to something not quite real, usually something with a whimsical or even dreamlike quality.",
    "long": "The adjective fanciful sprang from the 15th-century noun fancy, which was in turn a short version of the word fantasy. All three words contain the same elemental meaning, that of something unreal. Someone who is fanciful usually allows creative thought rather than the practical to come to the forefront. Edgar Allan Poe said, \"It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\""
  },
  "negligible": {
    "short": "When something is meaningless or insignificant because it is so little, it's negligible. The amount of interest you'll get on your savings is negligible, so you might as well spend your money.",
    "long": "If you work really hard on something, but the praise you get for it is negligible, you won't try so hard next time. Besides meaning very small, negligible can mean unimportant or not worth paying attention to. If you get into a fender-bender, you've gotten into a car accident with negligible damage. School concert programs always offer a word of thanks to the principal and other members of the administration whose role in the concert seems to be negligible."
  },
  "preeminent": {
    "short": "Calling someone preeminent means they're truly outstanding or better than everyone else — not in general, but in a specific field or specialty. Many people consider primatologist Jane Goodall to be the preeminent expert on chimpanzees.",
    "long": "The adjective preeminent was first recorded in the mid-15th century and has its roots in the Latin praeeminentem, which means “to project forward, rise above.” And anything that's been described as preeminent certainly does rise above the rest. Preeminent scholars or universities or craftsmen are the best at what they do and are well known because of it."
  },
  "mollycoddle": {
    "short": "Mollycoddle means to spoil or overindulge something. You can think of mollycoddle as an extreme form of coddle. If you constantly fuss over your dog and serve her homemade food while she's resting on a soft feather bed, you mollycoddle her.",
    "long": "Mollycoddle began as a noun describing a man who pampered or indulged himself too much. When applied to men, Molly, the woman's name, was a slur meaning \"too feminine.\" No longer just for men, the verb mollycoddle describes any kind of excessively indulgent or overprotective treatment. A coach may mollycoddle his star player by planning practice around his schedule, or you may mollycoddle your little sister by doing her homework for her when she says she's tired."
  },
  "prolong": {
    "short": "I don't want to prolong this definition, so I'll keep it short. To prolong is to make something last longer or to stretch it out in time.",
    "long": "You see the word long in prolong and it's no trick. If you prolong an argument with a sibling, you make it longer than it naturally would be. Prolong always has to do with time. When you stretch  your neck or a piece of cloth to make it appear longer, you are elongating, not prolonging, it."
  },
  "recant": {
    "short": "If you're someone who speaks before you think, you may need to recant, or take back, that overly honest assessment of your friend's new haircut.",
    "long": "Recant comes from two Latin roots: the prefix re-, meaning \"back,\" and the verb cantare, meaning \"to sing.\" It has been suggested that recant was first used when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung.  Regardless of whether this is true or not, we suggest that you refrain from singing when you need to recant — unless you've been casting nasty spells on people."

  "tome": {
    "short": "A tome is a large book. If you're pre-med, chances are you're going to have one heck of a tome for your biology class. Tome is often used to refer to a book that is not only really large but also unusually important.",
    "long": "If you generally carry more than one tome to class, invest in a bag with wheels so you don't hurt your back. A tome is big and heavy. \"Wow! This tome weighs a ton!\" Whatever you do, don't leave your tome at home—you'll wind up in detention! You can also use tome sarcastically to describe a book that clearly isn't large or important. But sarcasm is for advanced users only."
  },
  "allocate": {
    "short": "To allocate is to set aside a certain amount of money for an expense. You usually hear about the government allocating funds for education or the military, but you may personally allocate some of your allowance to buying comic books.",
    "long": "Aside from money, a common thing to allocate is time: \"The old woman in the shoe had so many children she could only allocate 2.7 minutes per day to talk to each one individually.\" Resources are also often allocated. Teachers, for example, are continuously allocating their year's supply of resources so they don't run out of glue sticks and paper before the end of the school year."
  },
  "concurrent": {
    "short": "Concurrent means happening at the same time, as in two movies showing at the same theater on the same weekend.",
    "long": "You might notice another adjective, current, in concurrent. While current refers to something that is happening right now, concurrent describes two or more things happening at the same time. A prisoner who is serving two concurrent five-year sentences will serve those prison terms together, meaning that he'll probably get out of jail in five years rather than ten. To help you remember the meaning of concurrent, imagine two parallel kayaks being carried down a river by the current at the same time."
  },
  "degenerate": {
    "short": "If something degenerates, it gets worse, like a food fight that degenerates to an all-out spaghetti-throwing war. Degenerate can also describe an immoral person — or the behavior of such a person.",
    "long": "Whether used as a verb, noun, or adjective, degenerate carries a sense of making worse or declining to a lower state. People who are degenerate, or who exhibit degenerate behavior, are often set apart from others, in part out of fear that their influence will degenerate the morals of the impressionable people around them."
  },
  "impugn": {
    "short": "To impugn means to call into question or attack as wrong. If your usually grumpy brother is suddenly nice and sweet, you'll impugn his motives if you're smart — he probably just wants something from you.",
    "long": "The root of impugn is the Latin pugnare which means \"to fight,\" so when you impugn, you are fighting or attacking, but by saying that something is false or wrong. If a candidate has a record that cannot be impugned, his or her opponent might go for a character attack. If you take pride in your work, you will be especially insulted if someone impugns your professionalism or integrity."
  },
  "picturesque": {
    "short": "You could describe a particularly pretty scene as picturesque. But save it up for a view that's so gorgeous you'd love to have it framed on the wall as a painting.",
    "long": "Picturesque is an adjective used to describe something with strikingly pleasing or vivid qualities — a scene so picture-perfect that you feel an impulse to reach for your camera or double check to make sure it's real. A view of the pristine shoreline on a summer’s day, a grandfather and grandson reading a book together, or a charming old farm cottage could all be called picturesque."
  },
  "debilitate": {
    "short": "To debilitate something is to make it weaker. A bad flu may debilitate your powers of concentration, like the New Year's resolutions that temporarily debilitate bakeries' business.",
    "long": "The verb debilitate traces back to the Latin word debilis, meaning “lame, disabled, crippled.” It’s often used to describe what disability or illness does to a person's health, but it can describe anything that has been weakened, like the sense of community that is slowly debilitated by people working longer hours and the lack of sidewalks that in many towns make it harder to walk around and meet the neighbors."
  },
  "abortive": {
    "short": "Did you ever start something and not finish it? If so, that was an abortive project. Abortive things don't get finished.",
    "long": "Abortive is a variation of abort, which means to end something, so something abortive never reaches its end point. If you tried like crazy to run a marathon but couldn't finish, your efforts were abortive. If someone tripped you during the marathon, their efforts were abortive too. Abortive things always lead to the words \"The end.\" Abortive can also be a way of avoiding the word unsuccessful."
  },
  "combat": {
    "short": "Combat is fighting between two groups of armed forces.  When you engage in combat, typically this means you engage in fighting that involves weapons.",
    "long": "Combat comes from the Latin com- meaning \"together with\" and battere meaning \"to fight.\" Combat can be used as a modifier; for example, a combat zone is an area where fighting is taking place. The word combat can also be used to refer to the action of fighting against something to prevent it. An after-school program for kids is working to combat the issue of street violence by creating a safe space where kids can go as an alternative."
  },
  "superlative": {
    "short": "A superlative is the highest attainable level or degree of something. As an adjective superlative means highest in quality.",
    "long": "When your history test results are superlative, it means you've gotten a perfect score — you've done as well as can be done, if not better than everyone else. There are times, however, when a superlative is an exaggerated expression of praise, as when a movie reviewer gets carried away with compliments and says in January that this is \"the best film of the year.\""
  },
  "gratuitous": {
    "short": "Gratuitous means \"without cause\" or \"unnecessary.\" Telling ridiculous jokes at a somber occasion would be a display of gratuitous humor.",
    "long": "Gratuitous can be used to refer to something that’s unnecessary and mildly annoying. If a friend frequently gives you fashion tips, even though you’ve expressed no interest in receiving them, you’d be correct in labeling her advice as gratuitous. In addition, gratuitous can be used to indicate that something is not only unnecessary but also inappropriate. Some people claim that some films and video games contain gratuitous violence — that is, violence that is excessive and offensive."
  },
  "proprietary": {
    "short": "If you own something, especially something of value, then you have proprietary rights. The word is most often used in relation to new inventions or patents.",
    "long": "Proprietary refers to property: things that are owned by individuals or businesses. People talk about proprietary drugs, proprietary software, and other things that can only be made and sold by those who discovered or created them. A proprietary claim is usually protected by trademark or copyright. When you say you have a proprietary right to something you're saying to everyone else: \"Hands off! This is mine.\" Years ago, owners of small mom-and-pop stores were known as proprietors."
  },
  "demagogue": {
    "short": "A demagogue is someone who becomes a leader largely because of skills as a speaker or who appeals to emotions and prejudices.",
    "long": "Though the Greek root for demagogue literally means \"a leader of the people,\" the word has for centuries had a negative connotation: it actually means a leader who has manipulated the emotions and prejudices of the rabble. The reason for the negative connotation is that in ancient Athens, \"the people\" were considered to be an uncivilized mob. Two of the most famous historical demagogues are said to be Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin."
  },
  "evict": {
    "short": "Use the verb evict to say that a tenant is being forced to move out of his home, usually through legal action. If you don't pay your rent, eventually your landlord will evict you.",
    "long": "Evict became part of the English language back in the 1530s. Based on the Latin word evincere, meaning \"recover property, overcome and expel, conquer,\" even then it had a legal process attached to it. Before you evict someone, you have to complete official paperwork, though some landlords may succeed in evicting tenants without following the legal steps."

  },
  "soliloquy": {
    "short": "Ever see someone talking while alone on a stage? That's what you call a soliloquy — a speech made by a character in a drama as if that character is voicing their own private thoughts. Shakespeare's plays are full of soliloquies.",
    "long": "The noun soliloquy comes from the Latin roots solus (\"alone\") plus loqui (\"speak\") — so the word literally means \"an act of speaking to oneself.\" A soliloquy is a dramatic speech that reveal's a character's inner thoughts and reflections. Some of the most famous lines in drama are taken from soliloquies. Hamlet's famous \"To be or not to be\" speech is a soliloquy, for example."
  },
  "vagrant": {
    "short": "A vagrant is someone who is homeless and poor and may wander from place to place. In fiction a vagrant often is a criminal, but a real-life vagrant might just be a person who has lost a job and family and lives off the streets with help from charity.",
    "long": "Many synonyms for vagrant imply laziness and criminal behavior, such as \"bum,\" \"tramp,\" and \"vagabond,\" and some vagrants do make money through crime. Often, though, a vagrant is a down-on-his-luck person who has lost work, family, or health and lives on the streets. European roots for vagrant point to \"wander\" or \"wander about,\" and a vagrant is a wanderer — a man or woman without a place to call home."
  },
  "virulent": {
    "short": "A virulent disease is one that's infectious, spreading, and making lots of people sick, while a virulent rant is just a verbal attack, causing sickness of the emotional kind. Either way, something virulent puts a strain on the people who get it.",
    "long": "Two meanings come out of the roots for virulent: \"poisonous\" and \"spiteful.\" The virus-carrying meaning of virulent often gets combined with strain, such as in a \"virulent strain of the flu.\" Those who aren’t carrying disease but are still considered virulent most likely lash out at others with a biting tone. Unleashing acid-tongued words on someone would be considered a virulent attack."
  },
  "mistrust": {
    "short": "To mistrust is to feel uneasy about someone or something. If you mistrust bus drivers, you may decide to walk instead.",
    "long": "Are you suspicious of clowns in general? Then you mistrust them. This verb has a very similar meaning to distrust — as nouns, both words mean \"a lack of trust.\" A subtle difference between the two is that distrust tends to be based on a bad experience (if a clown once pinched you, you will probably always distrust that clown). Mistrust, on the other hand, is a more general sense of suspicion."
  },
  "propel": {
    "short": "To propel is to push or drive forward, like a sheep dog nipping at the heels of his flock to keep them moving.",
    "long": "When you hear the verb propel,  imagine the propeller on an airplane — that spinning thing on the front that pulls the plane forward. Or maybe think of the old proverb that goes, “Our passions are the winds that propel our vessel. Our reason is the pilot that steers her. Without winds the vessel would not move and without a pilot she would be lost.”"
  },
  "surly": {
    "short": "Surly describes behavior nobody wants to be around. Think of the irritable old guy who lives on your street and always seems to be simmering with some sullen nasty anger, whose every utterance he spits out with a rude snarl. He's the poster boy for surly.",
    "long": "Surly behavior is always frowned upon, but the word's origins are in the behavior of English nobility. Surly's roots are in sirly, as in sir, meaning arrogant, haughty, and superior. Its current meaning implies all that and more, none of it appealing — rude, snotty, sullen, mean and cranky can be added to the list. Generally speaking, if you find yourself in a surly mood, avoid your friends and loved ones."
  },
  "party": {
    "short": "If you have a party, you invite people who will likely get along and like each other. If you join a political party, you choose the one whose members share your views.",
    "long": "Party comes from part, which means \"a division in the whole.\" You can see this in political parties: the groups that make up the whole of voters in a nation. Party also means \"person or group,\" which we are reminded of at restaurants when asked, \"How many are in your party?\" This is how party as in \"a social gathering\" or as a verb — the act of enjoying yourself at such a gathering — came about."
  },
  "endemic": {
    "short": "If you want to underscore just how commonly found and present something is within a particular place, try the word endemic. The saguaro cactus is endemic, or native, to the American southwest — so watch out for its sharp spines when you're hiking in Arizona!",
    "long": "Although endemic meaning \"prevalent\" often describes a plant or disease, it can also refer to something less tangible and more unwanted such as violence or poverty. Many complain of endemic corruption in the local government. Despite its -ic ending, endemic can also be used as a noun to signify a plant or animal that is prevalent in a certain region. If an endemic is brought to another area which it takes over, destroying the local population, it's classified as an invasive species."
  },
  "gauche": {
    "short": "Use the word gauche when you want to call something tacky, graceless, tactless, rude, boorish, or awkward and foolish. Have you just pointed out someone's misuse of this word? Oh dear, how gauche!",
    "long": "Gauche was used for a long time to refer to things that were just so wrong, it almost hurt to talk about them, like publicly asking someone why they don’t like you. That is so gauche, it could induce a cringe! Gauche is almost a gauche word, as it is comes from a French word meaning left (as opposed to right). It would be gauche to call left-handed people tacky!"
  },
  "strive": {
    "short": "To strive is to endeavor, reach, or strain for something above or beyond. We strive for self-improvement, a better world, or success in general.",
    "long": "The Old French origin of this word, estriver (\"quarrel,\" \"dispute\"), had its 800th birthday not too long ago. Though it shares its roots with strife (\"conflict\"), it changed over the years (centuries, actually) to describe something more like a conflict with oneself, the attempt to overcome limitations and stay focused on a goal, regardless of whatever quarrels or disputes come up."
  },
  "intrigue": {
    "short": "An intrigue is a secret plot. If you ever become the monarch of a small island kingdom, keep watch for signs of any intrigue against you.",
    "long": "Intrigue comes from the Latin verb intricare,  to entangle, and is related to intricate. It can be a noun, meaning underhanded plot, or a verb for the act of plotting. Agents of two opposing powers intrigue against each other. In the late nineteenth century it also came to mean the feeling of curiosity or interest. If someone's ideas intrigue you, you want to know more about them."
  },
  "transgress": {
    "short": "When you go beyond the boundaries, either physically or morally, you transgress. A river will transgress its banks as it floods, and students who cheat transgress school rules.",
    "long": "Transgress sounds like and means nearly the same thing as trespass. When you transgress a rule, you're breaking it. Religions often talk about transgressing: for Christians, breaking a commandment is transgressing against God by violating his wishes. Any transgression is pushing through a boundary: like a neighbor transgressing by letting their dog into your yard: that's a physical and a legal type of transgressing. The dog got into your territory, and the owners broke a rule."
  },
  "disguise": {
    "short": "A disguise is something you put on so no one recognizes you. It also can be used as a verb. You can disguise yourself with a wig and mustache; that's a great disguise.",
    "long": "Disguise can be used anytime you're talking about concealing or hiding something. Most of the time we think of a disguise as something you wear, but you can also disguise your feelings. Criminals might disguise their intentions. You can also use the word to describe something that seems to be one thing, but turns out to be another. You missed the plane, but then the plane crashed. That's a blessing in disguise."
  },
  "mania": {
    "short": "Mania is an extreme interest, desire, or craze. If you dye your dog's fur to match the colors of your favorite football team, you might be suffering from sportsmania.",
    "long": "Mania has for centuries been associated with “madness” or “mental derangement.” It's still used in the mental health fields to mean the excitable, overactive phase of bipolar disorder or, as a suffix, to describe a compulsion, such as kleptomania (to steal) or pyromania (to set fires). More generally, it might be used as a suffix to describe enthusiasm, as in Beatlemania (The Beatles) or Pottermania (Harry Potter)."
  },
  "drought": {
    "short": "When there is a drought somewhere, there's not enough rainfall. In certain areas, a drought can last for weeks, months, sometimes even years! Forget about running your lawn sprinkler during a drought; the water is needed for drinking, bathing, and toilet flushing.",
    "long": "Another way drought can be used is to refer to a shortage of something (other than rainfall) that lasts for a long period of time, like a drought in job growth during a recession. Typically a drought is not a good thing and something you hope to avoid. For example, if your friend Kenny hasn't gone on a date in five years, it's safe to say that he is having a romantic drought."
  },
  "virus": {
    "short": "Whether in the human body or on a computer, a virus is a disease-causing agent. If you come down with a nasty stomach virus, be sure to drink lots of water, get lots of rest, and stay near the toilet.",
    "long": "Virus comes from a Latin word that was spelled the same way. It specifically referred to the poisonous sap of certain plants, which explains why it sounds similar to viscous, a word meaning \"sticky.\"  Nowadays, it’s used to describe something that causes infectious diseases, specifically a tiny, self-replicating agent made up of genetic material and protein."
  },
  "boorish": {
    "short": "If your cousin tells revolting jokes, belches, and smells like he spent the winter in a cave, he could be described as boorish — an adjective used for people with bad manners and a sloppy appearance.",
    "long": "We almost always use the word boorish for men. This may be because it can be traced back to a 13th century word for “herdsman.” Herdsmen spent a lot of time alone with their sheep, sleeping in tents, and cooking over open fires, so it was no wonder that they didn't have the same refined manners as city folk. If someone offends you by acting boorishly — say, by cutting you off in traffic — you could exclaim, “What a boor!”  Just don't confuse boor with bore: bad manners may be offensive, but they're rarely boring."
  },
  "seclude": {
    "short": "When you seclude someone, you separate them from other people. A Buddhist monk might seclude himself in a remote place to meditate alone for several weeks.",
    "long": "Most people use the verb seclude to talk about shutting themselves away from society or keeping themselves separate from others. An eccentric family might seclude itself from the neighbors, for example. The root is Latin, secludere, which means \"shut off or confine,\" from se, \"apart\" and cludere, \"to shut.\" Originally, seclude was used to mean \"to enclose or confine,\" and by the 1620s it also meant \"to keep from public view.\""
  },
  "cynicism": {
    "short": "Cynicism is the feeling of distrust or that something isn't going to work out well. Some people feel cynicism when politicians make big promises.",
    "long": "To pronounce cynicism, place the accent on the first syllable: \"SIH-nuh-cih-zum.\" You might associate cynicism with sarcasm. Cynicism comes from believing that people are, at heart, selfish and untrustworthy. Sarcasm is the expression of negative feelings like cynicism, by expressing, for dramatic effect, the opposite of what is meant: \"I'm quite sure that politician took that bribe by mistake. We all know how easy it is to overlook the sudden appearance of $2 million dollars in your checking account.\""
  },
  "pulchritude": {
    "short": "If someone comments on the pulchritude of your face, you shouldn’t be offended. It may sound like quite the opposite, but pulchritude actually means “beauty.”",
    "long": "Pulchritude is one of those words that is more often commented upon for its oddness than actually used in its intended meaning. Many people dislike the sound of this word or are surprised to find that it is a synonym of beauty. These days pulchritude is considered outdated and is usually only used in highly literary writing or, in more common writing, to achieve a witty effect."
  },
  "attune": {
    "short": "When you attune to something, you adjust to it and become aware of the way it works. A new parent has to attune to a baby's schedule and personality.",
    "long": "Preschool teachers need to attune to their students' various needs and interests, and when you visit a foreign country it's important to attune to the unfamiliar culture, so that you're both comfortable and respectful. The verb attune is almost always followed by \"to,\" and it often shows up in the form of \"be attuned to.\" Attune comes from tune, \"bring into a state of proper pitch.\""
  },
  "diffuse": {
    "short": "Diffuse means to spread out. Candlelight can diffuse a soft glow throughout a room. A diffuse idea is one that spreads from person to person, and a diffuse speech is scattered and unclear.",
    "long": "As a verb, diffuse means to spread something out, but also applies to spreading things such as ideas or culture so that they become widely known. When something is diffused, it's mixed in, and when you drop propaganda pamphlets out of airplanes you're diffusing the propaganda. The adjective comes from Latin diffusus, from diffundere \"to pour in different directions,\" from the prefix dis- \"apart\" plus fundere, \"to pour.\""
  },
  "improvise": {
    "short": "To improvise means to make something up on the spot, or figure it out as you go. \"Our boss decided to improvise his speech at our company meeting and when he started going off-topic, everyone could tell he hadn't prepared in advance.\"",
    "long": "Improvise comes from the Latin word improvisus, meaning \"unforeseen, unexpected.\" Think about when something unexpected happens to you — you have no choice but to react in the moment, or improvise. Another meaning for improvise refers to acting onstage without a script. When actors improvise scenes for an audience, they create funny situations as they go, without having anything pre-planned. The Second City theater in Chicago made this type of comedy famous, with many well-known alumni like Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert."
  },
  "boon": {
    "short": "Boon means something beneficial to a specific person, entity, or cause. \"Getting called out of school on the day of the test was a boon for Sam, as he hadn't remembered to study.\"",
    "long": "Boon derives from the Old Norse bón, a request for a favor. Think of a boon as a favor that no one has necessarily asked for, something extra. \"We'd just spent our last dollar on a cup of coffee so it was a real boon to find a ten dollar bill lying on the sidewalk.\" Boon can also be an adjective for someone friendly and welcoming, as in \"a boon companion.\""
  },
  "aghast": {
    "short": "Would you be aghast, or shocked, to find out that your friends believe in ghosts, or would you share their frightened, or aghast, looks when a floating white being hovers over the campfire?",
    "long": "Aghast comes from Old English gasten, \"frighten,\" which comes in turn from gāst, \"ghost.\" If you've seen a look of absolute shock or terror on someone's face — like when your mom (or dad) sees a mouse — you can describe the look with the adjective aghast. If someone says \"You should have seen the look on your face!\" after sneaking up on you, you probably looked aghast yourself. \"Boo!\""
  },
  "optimum": {
    "short": "An optimum is the best condition or highest extent of something. He didn't mean to create a science experiment, but the unwashed coffee cup under his desk became the optimum dark, wet environment for growing lots of mold.",
    "long": "Optimum came into English in the 19th century from the Latin optimus, \"best.\" You can use optimum to describe the best conditions for meeting a goal or achieving something, and it often refers to conditions in scientific tests. Runners determine their optimum weight before running a marathon, and astronauts train in the optimum environments for recreating what they'll experience in space. Optimum conditions for a great barbecue might include sunshine and blue skies."

  "confer": {
    "short": "If you gab, chat, and talk it up with someone, you have conversation, but if you're looking for input from each other as you talk, you confer, or consult, together. They had a family meeting to confer about a schedule for sharing the new laptop.",
    "long": "Many uses of the verb confer involve consulting with another person or as a group. Confer has a second use meaning \"bestow,\" which means to award or hand over something. You can confer a medal on a winner or hero, or you can confer status through a promotion or assignment. Each year the teacher would confer the special honor of summer hamster-sitter on one responsible student."

  "articulate": {
    "short": "To articulate is to say something. And, if you say it well, someone might praise you by saying you are articulate. Confused yet? It's all in the pronunciation.",
    "long": "Reach for articulate when you need an adjective meaning \"well-spoken\" (pronounced ar-TIC-yuh-lit) or a verb (ar-TIC-yuh-late) meaning \"to speak or express yourself clearly.\" The key to understanding articulate's many uses is to think of the related noun article: an articulate person clearly pronounces each article of his or her speech (that is, each word and syllable), and an articulated joint is divided up into distinct articles, or parts."
  },
  "naysayer": {
    "short": "A naysayer is a person who always says \"No.\" Naysayers are negative and cynical — they aren't much fun to be around.",
    "long": "If you respond to every invitation with, \"No thanks — I wouldn't have fun anyway,\" and answer questions about how your day was with a list of complaints, you're a naysayer. It's your negative, pessimistic attitude that makes you a naysayer. In the 1600s a nay-say was a \"refusal,\" from the now less common use of nay to mean \"no.\""

  "enigma": {
    "short": "Use the noun enigma to refer to something that is a puzzle or a mystery. Why do you have to learn difficult words like this? That is an enigma.",

    "long": "The circle of rope is called a lasso. and to lasso is to use it to catch a runaway animal. A child might lasso her stuffed animals while riding a rocking horse, and during a rodeo, cowboys who specialize in \"trick roping\" use their lassos to do fancy spinning tricks. Lasso was coined in the U.S. around 1807, from the Spanish lazo, and its Latin root laqueum, both meaning \"noose\" or \"snare.\""

  "fetid": {
    "short": "If you want to understand the true meaning of  fetid, leave your sweaty gym clothes in your locker for a few days.  Fetid is a fancy way of saying that something smells really bad.",
    "long": "From the Latin word meaning \"stinking,\" this adjective has been in use since the early 15th century, which was a particularly fetid time in history — showers, laundry detergent, and deodorant had not yet been invented.  Here's an easy way to remember it: \"the fe(e)t (d)id stink.\" It's sometimes spelled foetid."
  },
  "inconstancy": {
    "short": "When your friend promises to save you the last piece of gum but doesn't, you might curse her for her inconstancy. Inconstancy means changeability, not sticking to a predetermined course.",
    "long": "Inconstancy is a word often associated with love––if someone promises to love you forever in eighth grade but ends up falling for someone else in ninth, their behavior testifies to the inconstancy of their love. Or the inconstancy of youth. Or maybe just the inconstancy of love in general."
  },
  "predict": {
    "short": "To predict is to say what you think is going to happen in the future.  If you predict that you'll win the poker championship, you're either really confident in your poker skills or you're cheating.",
    "long": "The prefix pre means \"before.\" Dict comes from the Latin dicere, which means \"to say,\" yet you can use predict to refer to things that can't say anything at all.  Darkening skies can predict a coming storm, for example, and a runny nose can predict a cold.   You can predict something based on factual evidence, or on a crystal-ball reading, or just on plain intuition."

  "vantage": {
    "short": "A vantage is a really good place from which to survey a scene. You might find that the roof of the house offers an excellent vantage from which to drop water balloons on your kid brother’s head.",
    "long": "Vantage is a variation of advantage, but when we use vantage we’re almost always talking about a position, not just general superiority. If you had extra tutoring for a big exam, you would have the advantage over a classmate who didn’t. But if your seat for the test allowed you to see the answer sheet lying on the desk, well then you would have a superior vantage — not that you would take advantage of that, of course!"
  },
  "demanding": {
    "short": "Something that's demanding calls for more work or skill than the typical task. Babysitting might seem like an easy job, but depending on the kids it can actually be incredibly demanding.",
    "long": "A demanding job might require a lot of physical work, like farming, or a lot of patience and diplomacy, like being a teacher or a marriage counselor. When a person is described as demanding, it usually means that he or she has very high standards or is especially hard to satisfy. The word comes from the Old French demander, \"to request or demand,\" by way of the Latin demandare, \"entrust.\""
  },
  "shatter": {
    "short": "When you shatter something, you smash it or break it into small bits. If your sister hits a baseball directly into the kitchen window, the window will shatter — and your sister will be in big trouble.",
    "long": "When you drop something fragile, it will probably shatter—lightbulbs, teacups, mirrors, and windows all shatter fairly easily. Things can also shatter in a less literal way, when it just feels like they're breaking apart violently. If your best friend ignores you all day, your heart shatters; and if you stumble and fall on your way up to a podium to give a speech, your confidence may shatter."
  },
  "capital": {
    "short": "Capital is the total amount of money (and things with a monetary value, like houses or cars) that a person or institution owns. A bank's capital might be in the billions, while your capital barely makes it into the hundreds.",
    "long": "Capital comes from the Latin capitalis, or \"head,\" which some would argue is the command center of your body. Because your head is so important, capital, as a noun and as an adjective, has come to refer to the primary or chief example of something — whether it's money, a letter, a crime, or the national or state seat of a government. It can be easily confused with the American word capitol, which refers to the buildings where government activities take place."
  },
  "monastic": {
    "short": "Monastic means like in a monastery. So what is it like in a monastery? Well, it's solitary, somewhat isolated, plain, and disciplined. If you take monastic vows, you promise to live this way.",
    "long": "Being monastic might sound like a strange or a hard thing to be, but you can compare it to student life very well. Both monks and students spend a lot of time studying books. Monks like quiet, and students need quiet to get work done. Monks live in a community devoted to religion, and students study in a community devoted to learning. The stereotypical party lifestyle of a student isn't very monastic though."
  },
  "forthright": {
    "short": "When a person is being forthright, they're being direct, clear, or even straight-up. The opposite of forthright might be evasive, shifty, indirect, or circuitous. But we're not here to talk about those. We're here to talk about forthright.",
    "long": "For the most part, people really appreciate it when others are forthright. It's so much easier to understand what someone wants when they just come out and say it. However, being direct and honest and saying what you really mean isn't easy for everyone. For some reason, a lot of us can be embarrassed to say what we want, and we spend our entire lives learning how to be forthright. A simple way to remember what forthright means is this: if you bring it \"forth,\" it will be \"right.\""
  },
  "exemplary": {
    "short": "Exemplary people excel at what they do and are excellent examples to others. Something exemplary is so good that it is an example for others to follow.",
    "long": "When something is the best it can be or reaches the highest point, it is exemplary and thus worth imitating. Exemplary comes from the Latin exemplum, meaning \"sample\" or \"example.\" While some people and things are held as examples of what not to do, an exemplary person or thing is always a positive example. A country can have an exemplary record of preventing pollution, and a person may have an exemplary reputation just for being all-around praiseworthy or noble."
  },
  "foreclosure": {
    "short": "When a homeowner can't afford to pay her mortgage, she might face foreclosure, which is when a bank repossesses a borrower's house.",
    "long": "A bank most often starts foreclosure proceedings against someone who's taken out a loan to buy a house when that person stops making monthly payments. The agreement a borrower makes when she gets a bank mortgage is that she'll pay a certain amount of money every month, and failing to do it means risking foreclosure. The word foreclosure comes from the Latin words fors, \"out,\" and clore \"to shut.\""

  "agitated": {
    "short": "Someone who is agitated is visibly upset. If you have ever walked into a room and instantly been asked, \"What's wrong?\" you probably looked agitated.",
    "long": "The verb agitate means \"to shake up.\" So someone who is agitated has been shaken up by something — disturbing news, a careless driver who nearly caused a huge accident, or just a very long, very bad day. Agitated can also describe being activated, or fired up about something. For example, a political cause might be losing steam until an event like a rally gets everyone agitated all over again."
  },
  "crescendo": {
    "short": "In a crescendo, the music is getting louder. There's often a crescendo in a large group of talking people, too.",
    "long": "This word comes from classical music, where it's very important how loudly the instruments play. If a tuba is crescendoing at the wrong time, then a quiet piano part might not be heard at all. The crescendo is important in all kinds of music, because volume — how loud something is — is one of the main features of music. If you are whispering and gradually raise your voice and then end up shouting, that's a crescendo as well."
  },
  "misogynist": {
    "short": "If you're someone who believes women belong in the kitchen and shouldn't be accorded the same respect as men, you might be a misogynist. A misogynist is a person who hates or doesn't trust women.",
    "long": "Misogynist is from Greek misogynḗs, from the prefix miso- \"hatred\" plus gynḗ \"a woman.\" The English suffix -ist means \"person who does something.\" The prefix mis-, a variant of miso- before a vowel, appears in the opposite term misandrist, which is a person who hates or doesn't trust men. The corresponding nouns are mysogyny and misandry."

  "exploit": {
    "short": "An exploit is a heroic act or notable deed. The King Arthur legends are full of stories of the exploits of the Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Lancelot and King Arthur himself.",
    "long": "This noun is from Middle English expleit, \"outcome,\" from Latin explicitus, \"unfolded, set forth.\" The verb exploit means to use someone or something, usually selfishly or for profit. Workers who are tired of being exploited by factory owners form unions that allow them to stand together as a powerful force."
  },
  "reinstate": {
    "short": "When you reinstate someone, you return that person to a position or job. A principal might reinstate a laid off teacher when the school starts hiring again.",
    "long": "Bosses can reinstate employees, countries can reinstate kings and queens, and governments can reinstate, or bring back, old laws. For example, during times of war the United States could very well reinstate the draft, which is not currently a law but has been in the past. Although it's not as common as reinstate, the word instate, from which it comes, means \"to put someone in a certain state or condition.\""
  },
  "rue": {
    "short": "To rue is to feel regret or remorse for something. If that position at the deli ended up involving a reality TV show that made everyone famous, you may rue the day you turned down the job.",
    "long": "Rue comes from the Old English word hreowan, meaning \"to make sorry,\" and rue can still sum up a lot of sorrow in one small syllable. Rue is a modern verb that often looks back on the past. Shakespeare made famous the phrase \"rue the day,\" meaning you bitterly regret a moment. For example, you might rue the day you had your first coffee if you become hopelessly addicted to it. As a noun, rue can also refer to an aromatic herb."
  },
  "din": {
    "short": "Walk into the average school cafeteria at lunchtime, and you'll get a good sense of what a din is — loud, confused, continuous, generally unpleasant, and often potentially headache-inducing noise.",
    "long": "Who knew noise pollution was a problem in ancient times? Humans have been experiencing loud, sustained, annoying sounds for centuries, judging by the etymology of the word din. It traces its roots back to Old English dyne or dynn, which had the same meaning as din does today, only with a different pronunciation. Before that, it popped up in Old Norse as dynr and meant to \"come rumbling down\" — fitting, from the language that gave us Thor, the God of Thunder."
  },
  "grotesque": {
    "short": "Use grotesque to describe things that are very strange and ugly in an unnatural way. If something \"grosses you out,\" you can safely refer to it as grotesque.",
    "long": "Grotesque also refers to a style of art that uses odd and fanciful combinations of natural, human, and animal forms. The original reference was to cave paintings found in ancient Roman ruins. Our English word is from French, from Italian grottesca pittura \"a cave painting,\" from grotta \"cave.\" Italian grotta is the source of our English word grotto."
  },
  "inscrutable": {
    "short": "Any person or thing that's mysterious, mystifying, hard to read, or impossible to interpret is inscrutable. You ever notice how it's hard to tell what some people are thinking? Those folks are inscrutable.",
    "long": "A good way to think about what inscrutable means is to consider cats and dogs. Dogs wear their hearts on their sleeves, shaking when they're afraid and bouncing up and down when they're happy. Dogs are definitely not inscrutable, because you can tell what they're thinking and feeling. On the other hand, cats are very difficult to read. Even longtime cat owners aren't always sure what's going on with their kitty. Cats are very inscrutable animals."
  },
  "decorum": {
    "short": "Decorum is proper and polite behavior. If you let out a big belch at a fancy dinner party, you're not showing much decorum.",
    "long": "This noun is from Latin decōrus \"proper, becoming, handsome,\" from décor \"beauty, grace,\" which is also the source of English décor.

    "short": "Approbation is a formal word for approval or praise. Approbation is like getting the nod in a big way. Politicians rely on the public’s approbation to get elected.",
    "long": "How is it possible that approbation means approval when probation is a form of being in trouble? Probation is a testing period, to see if you can be good. Approbation means it's all good. Or you can remember this rhyme: \"Filled with approbation, the audience gave a standing ovation.\""
  },
  "braggart": {
    "short": "If you know someone who is a real show off and is always bragging about how great they are, then you might call this boaster a braggart.",
    "long": "Braggart is a pejorative word, which means it is used as an insult, so you shouldn’t call your boss or your teacher a braggart — unless you’re looking for trouble. Braggart is similar to other pejoratives like blowhard or bigmouth. Braggarts are characterized by talking loudly (usually in praise of themselves, their possessions, or their accomplishments) and are quick to assert their superiority over others."
  },
  "covert": {
    "short": "Covert means secret or hidden. Soldiers might take part in a covert mission to infiltrate an enemy camp — and you might take part in a covert mission to steal your brother's leftover Halloween candy.",
    "long": "Covert is the opposite of overt, which means obvious, or in full view. Covert things are hidden, private, or stealthy. It comes from the Old French covert, or \"covered.\" A covert bag of chips you've snuck into the movie theater might literally be covered, hidden under your coat, while a covert plan to throw your dad a surprise party is just a secret."
  },
  "ingratiating": {
    "short": "If someone in your class places an apple on your teacher's desk in an ingratiating manner, that means he's making a calculated move to suck up and win your teacher's favor.",
    "long": "The word ingratiating comes from a combination of the Latin prefix in- meaning \"in\"  and gratia meaning \"favor, grace.\" A person who is ingratiating is trying to get in the favor or grace of those around her. But the word doesn't always have to imply a sly attempt at winning others over, sometimes it can simply mean charming or agreeable. A person's smile can be ingratiating, winning people over simply with its charm."
  },
  "potential": {
    "short": "If you can describe something as possible but not yet actual, choose the adjective potential. Companies try to reach potential customers through advertising.",
    "long": "Potential, from the Latin potentia \"power,\" sounds more complicated than it is. It describes something or someone that has the power to become something. A potential success is not yet a success but could be if circumstances are right. When a situation has the potential for disaster, it could turn bad easily. You have potential if you have a natural but undeveloped ability to do something and a building with potential will be really nice once it's fixed up."
  },
  "skiff": {
    "short": "A skiff is a small boat. If you decide to purchase a skiff instead of giant yacht, you're probably someone who prefers the quiet, simple life. (Or maybe you just didn’t want to spend the money on a yacht.)",
    "long": "A skiff may be powered by oars, sails, or a motor, but in any of these cases, a typical skiff can carry only a few passengers. Skiff originally referred to a small boat attached to a large ship; the skiff would have been used for communication with and transportation to other large ships and the shore. Winslow Homer, a 19th-century American artist, often portrayed skiffs in his depictions of marine scenes."

Sometimes the quality of airlessness shades the other meaning of the word, implying that the rarefied world of elegant people isn't comfortable to everyone."
  },
  "euphoric": {
    "short": "To be euphoric is to be carried away with amazingly good feelings.  The euphoric feeling of having won the lottery ended quickly when you saw your pet ferret chewing up your lottery ticket.",
    "long": "When someone's euphoric, they're so happy that they might have lost touch with reality for the moment.  This “too good to be true” quality is one reason some drug-induced states get described as euphoric.  In fact, euphoria, which euphoric stems from, originally meant a feeling of wellness caused in the sick by the use of drugs."
  },
  "deceive": {
    "short": "To deceive means to trick or lie. A crafty kid might deceive his mother into thinking he has a fever by holding the thermometer to a light bulb to increase the temperature.",
    "long": "Deceive is the trickier cousin of lie. You might lie about why you were late to school. But if you simply don't explain to your mom that you were late in the first place, you are deceiving her. Deceive carries with it a feeling of both craftiness and betrayal. When you deceive someone, forgiveness can be hard to come by. Have you heard of the spelling rule, \"i before e except after c\" that has so many exceptions? Well, deceive follows that rule."
  },
  "resuscitate": {
    "short": "To resuscitate is to revive a person who has lost consciousness. In recent years it's become important for people to learn CPR so that they might resuscitate someone who loses consciousness, and many schools and hospitals offer classes in CPR.",
    "long": "The Latin word suscitāre, \"to raise,\" combines with re-, \"again,\" to create the base of the verb resuscitate. Through the years, methods of resuscitation have advanced to the current sophisticated and effective levels of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, and defibrillation paddles that can shock a heart back to life. In fact, some patients nowadays ask to sign a \"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) order to allow them to die without medical interventions like resuscitation."
  },
  "chic": {
    "short": "Something that's chic is fashionable or stylish. If you see a chic outfit in the window of a chic boutique, you might imagine that buying it will make you as chic as a fashion model.",
    "long": "Chic can also be used as an noun to mean a specific type of stylishness or coolness, like a downtown urban chic (skinny jeans, perhaps), or nerdy chic (big glasses). Chic is a French word, so remember, whether it's an adjective or a noun, to pronounce it as “sheek” and not “chick,” so you can sound as chic as you look!"
  },
  "elaboration": {
    "short": "Elaboration means \"adding details.\" Kids are famous for answering \"good\" when asked how school was and \"nothing\" when asked what they did there. If pressed for elaboration, they might talk about recess, lunch, and even what they learned.",
    "long": "Elaboration is the result of going that extra mile, such as when your history teacher asks for five paragraphs on the Fall of Rome, and you write three pages, or when your friend, instead of giving you a regular birthday card, creates a mini-scrapbook with photos and mementos from the past year. As you can see, elaboration takes time and energy because you go into greater detail than usual."
  },
  "ignominy": {
    "short": "If you walk into class in your underwear, you'll know what the word ignominy means. Ignominy is a noun meaning great public shame, disgrace, or embarrassment, or a situation or event that causes this.",
    "long": "The shame can be major or minor: someone can suffer the ignominy of defeat or the ignominies of old age. When pronouncing this word, the main accent is on the first syllable, and the secondary accent is on the third syllable. Ignominy is from Latin the ignominia, formed from the prefix in-, \"no, not,\" plus nomen, \"name.\" The implication is that if someone has suffered ignominy, they have lost their good name or reputation."
  },
  "ascetic": {
    "short": "Want to live an ascetic lifestyle? Then you better ditch the flat panel TV and fuzzy slippers. To be ascetic, you learn to live without; it's all about self-denial.",
    "long": "Ascetic is derived from the Greek asketes, meaning “monk,” or “hermit.” Later that became asketikos, meaning “rigorously self-disciplined,” which gives us the Modern English ascetic. Ascetic can be a noun: a person with incredible self-discipline and the ability to deprive herself, or an adjective that describes such a people or their lifestyle."
  },
  "fortify": {
    "short": "If you add nutrients to something you fortify it. Food scientists have found ways to fortify cereal, but in addition to vitamins C and D, they usually add a lot of sugar.",
    "long": "If you strengthen your defenses, you fortify them, perhaps by adding more arms or increasing your defensive walls. Sometimes the defenses you fortify will be tangible and sometimes the word is used metaphorically to mean give courage. If a castle was originally vulnerable to attack, the owner might fortify it by adding a moat — and maybe filling it with crocodiles. If you're nervous about giving a speech, you should fortify yourself with a pep talk first."
  },
  "sift": {
    "short": "To bake a cake, you sift the flour to get out the lumps. When you sift, you separate out one thing from another.",
    "long": "When you sort through the mail looking for the bills or go through your photos to find that shot of your dog, that’s sifting, too. Detectives sift through piles of evidence when investigating crimes, and you might sift through the hundred applications you get from drummers eager to join your band, to find Ms. Right. When you're at the beach, you can sift sand through your fingers, and you might see big machines that sift the sand to clean it."
  },
  "terrestrial": {
    "short": "Not straying far from its Latin root terra, meaning \"earth,\" terrestrial means \"of the earth.\" If it's terrestrial, you'll find it on earth. If it's extraterrestrial, you'll find it emerging from a UFO.",
    "long": "The adjective terrestrial can also be used to describe something that lives on land (as opposed to living in water, for example). \"On their trip to the rain forest, the scientists were charged with cataloging terrestrial animals. Another group was going to be in charge of cataloging the aquatic animals.\" The adjective can also be used to describe something that is mundane in character. The teenager cried, \"My life is boring and full of terrestrial events like going to band practice and to class!\""

  "jocund": {
    "short": "You know that teacher who always has a goofy smile on his face and a bad pun for the kids? He's got a jocund personality, meaning he's merry and cheerful.",
    "long": "The word jocund came from the influence of two Latin words, jocundus, which means pleasant, and jocus, which is just what it sounds like: a joke. Usually the word is used to describe people, but not always.  Say your family gets together every year for a big, merry barbecue — you could describe it as a jocund gathering, or a jocund weekend.  It's a sort of old-fashioned word, though, so use it sparingly."
  },

  "fervid": {
    "short": "Fervid can be used to describe something that is physically hot such as “a fervid day in August,” but it is more often used to describe heated emotions like anger, love, or desire.",
    "long": "When passions and emotions run wild, you should expect to hear some fervid language thrown about. The adjective fervid comes from the Latin fervidus which means “glowing, burning, or boiling.” It is often used like the word fiery. You might hear a politician deliver a fervid speech if he or she is particularly worked up over an issue."
  },
  "scintillate": {

    "long": "Scintillate means to be sparkling and lively. Scintillate has its roots in the Latin words scintillare, meaning \"to sparkle,\" and scintilla, meaning \"a spark.\" The verb scintillate is related to the adjective scintillating and the noun scintilla. If you enjoy witty repartee, people may say your conversation scintillates with humor and they enjoy how you are so clever."
  },
  "tumultuous": {
    "short": "The adjective tumultuous means disruptive, troubled, or disorderly — like the tumultuous state of an unruly classroom after the teacher has stepped out for a few minutes.",
    "long": "You might hear the adjective tumultuous in news stories about riots because it's one of the best words to describe a group of people in turmoil or disorder, but it can mean anything in a state of unrest. For example, you might steer your boat into a safe harbor before a heavy storm, so the tumultuous waves won't sweep you onto the rocks."
  },
  "insidious": {
    "short": "If something is slowly and secretly causing harm, it's insidious — like the rumors no one seems to listen to until suddenly someone's reputation is ruined.",
    "long": "Insidious is related to the Latin noun, īnsidiae meaning \"ambush\" which comes from the Latin verb, īnsidēre \"to lie in wait for.\" This is very fitting as an insidious rumor or problem is one whose negative effect is not realized until the damage is already done. Similarly, an insidious disease develops internally without symptoms, so that you don't realize right away that you are sick."
  },
  "plea": {
    "short": "A plea is what you make when you're begging for something with a sense of urgency and emotion. While you wouldn't call asking for a hall pass a plea, you could make a plea for justice or world peace.",

When you get a traffic ticket or if you're accused of a crime, you have to enter a plea of \"guilty\" or \"not guilty.\" A \"plea bargain\" is when you make a deal with the prosecutor — you may plead guilty to a charge (by entering a guilty plea) that has less of a penalty and, in return, the prosecutor drops the more serious charge."

  "virulence": {
    "short": "Virulence is a harmful quality possessed by microorganisms that can cause disease. You can also use the noun virulence to describe someone's malicious actions.",
    "long": "A virus spreads disease, and virulence is a quality possessed by viruses that are on the loose and spreading. This could be as common as the flu or as unusual as chemical warfare. You can also speak of the virulence of hostile, harmful words and actions. Publicly insulting and discrediting someone is an example of virulence.

    "short": "If someone is being scornful and mocking in a humorous way, call her sardonic. If you want to write comic sketches for late-night talk shows, work on being sardonic.",
    "long": "Sardonic comes from the Greek adjective Sardonios, which actually describes a plant from a place called Sardinia that supposedly made your face contort into a horrible grin...right before you died from its poison.  The Greeks used sardonic for laughter, but we only use it when someone's humor is also mocking or ironic."

  "aspiration": {
    "short": "If your aspiration, or ambition, is to climb Mt. Everest someday, you better start training, because it’s a long, hard climb that requires a lot of preparation.",
    "long": "Aspiration means \"inhalation\" or \"breathing.\" So how did it come to mean \"ambition\" or \"the will to succeed\"? The Latin gives us a clue: spirare (\"to breathe\") and spiritus (\"spirit\"). It was once believed that our breath was our soul or spirit, which might explain why we talk about \"breathing life into\" something, or coming up with energy and ideas to invigorate it. How else to breathe life into something than with ambition and drive, in other words, \"spirit\"?"

  "objurgate": {
    "short": "How dare you! To objurgate is to scold or reprimand. Don’t objurgate yourself, or beat yourself up if you didn’t know it — it’s an old word that people don’t use much anymore.",
    "long": "To scold — or to express your disgust and condemnation of — is to objurgate, although this useful word has become quite rare. You're more likely to hear someone use words like castigate or reprimand these days. Objurgate comes directly from the Latin obiurgare, \"to chide or rebuke.\""

  "natty": {
    "short": "Natty means current in style, both of dress and manners. A natty dresser is someone who is very stylish and has a snappy attitude. He may even be wearing a natty fedora.",
    "long": "Natty is an adjective that comes from the 18th century. Originally it was a slang term, perhaps related to the adjective neat. These days, if you say someone “looks neat,” it might sound like they look clean, but it also can mean that they look fashionable and put together. That’s what natty means, too. Someone who is natty is wearing fashionable clothes and is generally hip."
  },
  "tyranny": {
    "short": "Tyranny is a noun that describes a repressive and arbitrarily cruel regime. Don't accuse your mother of tyranny just because she won't let you play video games all weekend long.",
    "long": "One of the root words of tyranny is the Latin tyrannia which means the \"rule of a tyrant\" and a tyrant is a \"cruel master.\" Today, it can mean the repressive regime of a dictator or it can also mean being controlled by something metaphorically harsh like time or work. Maybe the oldest example of a tyranny is that of Tyrannosaurus Rex, or \"king of the giant lizards,\" who many of us grew up thinking was the largest, most predatory and frightening of the dinosaurs who supposedly ruled over the rest of the dinosaur world with its huge, sharp teeth and claws."

  "adjunct": {
    "short": "Adjunct means something added on, but not part of the whole. An adjunct professor is someone who is hired by a college to teach but isn't a full member of the faculty.",
    "long": "This is a word you can figure out by taking it apart. From ad- \"to\" and -junct \"join\" (think \"junction\"), you can see that this is about joining something to another. \"During lunch, Tim always sat at the girls' lacrosse-team lunch table, and they joked that he was an adjunct member of the team.\""

  "provenance": {
    "short": "Where something comes from is its provenance. If a style of music originated in the capital of Rhode Island, you could say that its provenance was Providence.",
    "long": "Some items of foreign provenance are taxed more heavily than domestic products. If you claim that an artwork put up for sale was stolen from your family's art collection, an investigation may be ordered to resolve issues of provenance. In this case, provenance refers to who has the legal right to the specific work of art, or to whom it belongs."

  "plenty": {
    "short": "If you've eaten your fill at a big meal, you know by your full stomach that you have had plenty. In fact, if you had more than plenty, you might even get the feeling you've had too much!",
    "long": "The word plenty usually refers to more than just enough, and this comes, via Middle French plenté, from the Latin word plēnitās, \"fullness,\" from plenus, \"full, complete.\" The meaning is apparent in the following quote by English novelist George Eliot: \"I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music.\" May you have plenty of what you need, and some of what you want as well."
  },
  "cipher": {
    "short": "A cipher is a secret code, usually one that's created using a mathematical algorithm. Sometimes the message written in code is itself called a cipher.",
    "long": "Cipher comes from the Arabic sifr, which means \"nothing\" or \"zero.\" The word came to Europe along with the Arabic numeral system. As early codes substituted numerals for letters to hide the word’s meaning, codes became known as ciphers. If you crack a cipher, you break the code and can understand the message. From its \"zero\" meaning, cipher can also be used for a person who has no influence or importance in the world."

  "commercial": {
    "short": "Commercial is an adjective describing something with money-making and marketing intentions. If you’re a bit of a book snob, steer clear of commercial fiction, which is written for the widest enjoyment.",
    "long": "The adjective commercial first appeared in the 1680’s, long before television commercials, which is probably what you think of when you hear the word. An al was added to commerce, and it meant \"pertaining to trade.\" It wasn’t until the 1870's that commercial meant “done for the sake of financial profit,” and then later in the 1930's, the noun form was refined to describe “an advertisement broadcast on radio or TV.”"

  "stolid": {
    "short": "A stolid person can’t be moved to smile or show much sign of life, in much the same way as something solid, like a giant boulder, is immovable. Both are expressionless.",
    "long": "It's hard to get excited about the word stolid. It refers to emotionless people or things, and it even sounds pretty dull. Your face may be stolid, as you plod through the unemotional history of the word born in the 17th century of little more than Latin words for \"foolish.\" In some definitions, stolid does have more complimentary synonyms, such as \"dependable\" or \"calm,\" but these can be overshadowed by other words for stolid — \"empty,\" \"blank,\" and \"vacant,\" to name a few."
  },
  "amorphous": {
    "short": "Amorphous means without a clearly defined form, like the moon's amorphous reflection in a lake. Figuratively, something amorphous lacks focus, be it a work of art, a political movement, or even someone's life plans.",
    "long": "The Greek roots of this word are clear:  morphē means \"form,\" and a- means \"lacking or without.\" When creative works or ideas are described as amorphous, it means they suffer from a lack of organization. An amorphous object lacks a well-defined outline or structure, like amorphous jellyfish drifting on the surface of the ocean.  And scientifically, this adjective simply describes something without a crystalline form, like an amorphous metal or amorphous ice."
  },
  "vituperative": {
    "short": "Use the adjective vituperative to describe criticism that's so sharp it hurts. A vituperative review of a movie would make the director bitter for months.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce vituperative, remember that the first vowel sound is the long i sound, and the second syllable is accented: \"vie-TOO-per-uh-tive.\" Being vituperative takes criticism to the next level. Vituperative criticism is harsh, scathing, even abusive. If a review or assessment is vituperative, it doesn't say \"try harder next time.\" Instead it gives the sense of \"go away and never come back.\""
  },
  "dwindle": {
    "short": "What do love, money, and the earth all have in common? All can dwindle, or shrink away, if we don't handle them properly.",
    "long": "The word dwindle has a wonderfully descriptive, almost childlike sound to it, as though it belongs in a nursery rhyme. That might help you remember the meaning, which is to shrink away gradually, like the Cheshire Cat in \"Alice in Wonderland,\" who dwindles away until nothing is left but his grin."

  "remorse": {
    "short": "Remorse, a noun, is what you feel if you regret your actions or wish for another outcome.",
    "long": "The noun remorse has a very vivid origin. It comes from the Latin roots re  for \"again\" and mordere \"to bite.\" So, if you feel remorse, it means that your conscience is working on you, your past actions are biting you back, and making you feel very regretful. Synonyms for this word are \"penitence,\" \"rue,\" and \"contrition.\" If you took a cookie from the cookie jar and ate it you can't return it; all you can feel is remorse for what you did!"
  },
  "viscid": {
    "short": "The adjective viscid is used to describe something that is sticky or a thick, slow-moving liquid. If you bake bread and you get flour all over your counters, clean it up carefully because adding water can turn the flour into a viscid paste, and then you'll really have a mess!",
    "long": "The word viscid is from the Latin word viscum, or birdlime. Birdlime is a sticky substance made from sap and is smeared on branches. Small birds land on the branches and are trapped, allowing someone to easily catch them. The word viscous comes from the same root and has a similar meaning — think of lava and how it moves slowly and thickly down a mountain."
  },
  "lopsided": {
    "short": "Something that's lopsided is crooked or off-balance, like your grandma's lopsided hat, which sits askew on her head.",
    "long": "You can use the adjective lopsided to describe things that are crooked or asymmetrical. A bad toothache might cause one side of your jaw to swell, leaving your face feeling — and looking — lopsided. You might say that your school's student council election is lopsided if one candidate is clearly more qualified than the other. The word lopsided was originally lapsided, and in the early 1700s it almost always referred to a tilting ship."
  },
  "nepotism": {
    "short": "Nepotism is the practice of favoritism based on kinship, like when the coach chooses his own kid to be the quarterback even if his kid stinks at football.",
    "long": "The word nepotism comes from the Italian word for nephew, nepote. Apparently back in the 17th century a lot of people tended to promote their nephews to powerful positions at the expense of other candidates. Nepotism has come to mean favoritism of any family member, so if you’re the daughter of a powerful CEO, don’t worry, you can still be the beneficiary of nepotism. However, people might not like you when you become the Vice President, unless you’ve really earned the title."
  },
  "inspired": {
    "short": "Inspired is an adjective that describes something of excellent quality. If your singing in a choral concert is particularly inspired, people can hear your voice hitting all the right notes beautifully.",
    "long": "If something is so extraordinary that it's worthy of being described as inspired, you might think that the gods had something to do with its creation. In fact, inspired originally meant \"directly inspired by God or gods.\" It comes from the Latin in-\"in\" and spirare \"to breathe.\" Maybe such supernatural power did breathe life into something truly excellent. Or maybe the humans just worked very hard and had a great idea."
  },
  "decimate": {
    "short": "If something is drastically reduced or killed, especially in number, you can say it was decimated. \"The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico decimated the wildlife along the coast.\"",
    "long": "The verb decimate originally referred to a form of capital punishment for Roman troops. If there was a rebellion, one out of every ten men (thus the dec in decimate) was put to death. So the word's first expanded usage was to mean a ten percent reduction or a ten percent tax. Modern usage gives the word decimate its \"drastically reduced\" meaning, but the verb can also be used to mean \"to wipe out\" or \"to eliminate.\""
  },
  "frenzy": {
    "short": "In a frenzy, people go into a state of hysteria. Stay away from hungry sharks or kids at a 16th birthday party when the pizza arrives if you don't want to get caught up in a feeding frenzy.",
    "long": "Frenzy is derived from the Latin word phreneticus meaning \"delirious.\" If you're in a frenzy, you're certainly delirious. You can be in a frenzy because something made you mad, happy, or even just hungry — whatever makes you so crazy you're not thinking clearly. Frenzy is often used when talking about a group of people (or animals) who get worked up at the same time about the same thing, like sharks near tasty fish or teenagers near pizza."
  },
  "indigenous": {
    "short": "Use indigenous to describe a plant, animal or person that is native or original to an area. Though Switzerland is known for its chocolates, chocolate, which comes from the cocoa plant, is indigenous to South America.",
    "long": "Indigenous, aboriginal, and native all mean the same thing. Aboriginal, however, is commonly used in connection with Australia, and native with North America. The most neutral of the three terms, indigenous comes from the Latin word, indigena meaning \"a native.\" An indigenous ceremony or religion is one traditionally used by a certain group of people."
  },
  "bespeak": {
    "short": "To bespeak is to imply or signal something, the way your neighbor's electric car might bespeak concern for the environment.",
    "long": "You can use this verb to mean \"indicate\" or \"convey indirectly.\" Your city's excellent schools and smooth, well-cared-for streets may bespeak high taxes to people who are considering buying a house there. Your interest in foreign films and philosophy might bespeak a deep intelligence and curiosity to your teachers. And if you're really paying attention, you'll realize your friend's crankiness bespeaks her fear of starting at a new school next fall."

  "polyglot": {
    "short": "Ni hao! Comment allez-vous?  Estoy bien, gracias.  Sayōnara!  If you understood everything you just read, you’re probably a polyglot — a person who understands multiple languages.",
    "long": "There are thousands of languages spoken in the world, but you don’t need to know them all to be a polyglot. The –glot comes from the Greek word for “tongue,” and the prefix poly- means “more than one,” so if you speak two or more languages, you’re technically a polyglot. Well done! Polyglot can also be used as an adjective, like describing \"a polyglot neighborhood\" full of people from many different cultures or the \"polyglot crowd at the Olympic games.\""
  },
  "temperate": {
    "short": "Temperate means mild, moderate. If you're a temperate person, you are calm, reasonable. If you live in a temperate climate, it's warm and sunny, but not too hot.",
    "long": "Like other words that sound similar, temperate has to do with measurement and range. Temperatures measure how hot and cold things are and someone with a temper is hot-headed or intemperate, the opposite of this word. A temperate person's life motto is summed up by Goldilocks: not too hot and not too cold, just right."

  "intoxicate": {
    "short": "Alcohol's effect on most people, especially when they drink too much of it, is to intoxicate them. If you're not used to drinking, a glass of Champagne may intoxicate you.",
    "long": "Beer, wine, and hard liquor can all intoxicate those who drink them. It's worth noting that in the fifteenth century, intoxicate meant \"to poison.\" A less poisonous way to intoxicate is to \"fill with delight or happiness.\" A gorgeous summer day might intoxicate you, or winning first prize in poetry contest."
  },
  "tarnish": {
    "short": "To tarnish is to become dull or discolored. Silver tends to tarnish easily, which is why your mother is always having you polish the family silver.",
    "long": "As a noun, a tarnish is the dull layer of corrosion that sometimes forms on metal items, usually the result of the metal reacting to oxygen in the air. Metals are most likely to tarnish, but so can anything that once felt sparkly and bright but has lost its luster — even you. If the new kid just beat you in chess, your reputation as the best chess player in your class has started to tarnish. Better not lose again!"

    "long": "When someone hallucinates, what they're perceiving seems very real and vivid, although it's not. Many different things can cause a person to hallucinate, including drugs, mental illness, damage to the brain, and even lack of adequate sleep. Some people hallucinate regularly, if mildly, just as they're falling asleep at night. The original meaning of hallucinate was \"deceive,\" from the Latin hallucinatus, \"wander in the mind.\""

  "ogle": {
    "short": "When you ogle someone, you look at them with love or desire in mind. And if you're a cartoon character, you might also be drooling.",
    "long": "Though it's most often used to refer to the way people gaze at each other, the verb ogle can also be used when talking about any object of desire — like when you ogle those designer jeans or that red Ferrari. The word comes from the 1680s German word oeglen, meaning \"look at.\" Men are known to ogle women much more frequently than women ogle men. Ever seen a scene in a movie where a pretty lady walks into a bar and all the men turn on their bar stools to watch her pass by? That's classic ogling."

    "short": "If you are gullible, the joke is on you because you are easily fooled.",
    "long": "It is thought that gullible might be derived from the verb gull, meaning \"to swallow.\" This would be a funny coincidence as gullible describes an overly trusting person who tends to swallow the stories he hears whole. The related word, gull, can be used as a noun \"don't be such a gull!\" or as a verb \"you can't gull me into believing that!\""

  "unscathed": {
    "short": "If you walked away from a nasty bike accident without a scratch, you walked away unscathed, meaning you came out unharmed.",
    "long": "You can also come through a scandal unscathed, with your reputation untarnished, or your dog-walking business may emerge from the financial crisis unscathed and more profitable than ever. With the word unscathed, there's always a sense of something bad that might have happened but didn't."

  "dexterity": {
    "short": "If you fall asleep with your heavy head on your arm, you might not have the dexterity, or control of your hand, to hit the OFF button on the alarm clock in the morning.",
    "long": "Very small children do well with mittens, because their dexterity, or skill in using their hands, isn’t as developed as in older kids and adults, who wear gloves to separate their fingers. Dexterity helps fingers and hands to coordinate for completing fine tasks like writing, sewing, and playing string instruments. \"Mental dexterity\" means a sharpness of mind, or skill in thinking creatively and understanding and expressing something quickly and easily."
  },
  "spurious": {
    "short": "Something false or inauthentic is spurious. Don't trust spurious ideas and stories. Spurious statements often are lies, just as a spurious coin is a counterfeit coin — a fake.",
    "long": "Anytime you see the word spurious, you're dealing with things that can't be trusted or accepted at face value. A spurious claim is one that's not backed up by the facts. A spurious argument relies on faulty reasoning — and maybe some lies. Politicians often accuse each other of saying things that are spurious and meant to deceive the voters. As long as you're honest, clear, and not trying to trick anyone, nobody can say you're being spurious."

  "reactionary": {
    "short": "A reactionary is someone who opposes reform or change, especially in the realm of politics.",
    "long": "A reactionary is someone reacting (in horror) to what others consider to be progress. No one describes themselves as reactionary — you will hear it more often as a condemnation, as in \"I cannot support the reactionary policy of mandatory military service for 18-year-olds.\""

  "faction": {
    "short": "Fractions are smaller parts of whole numbers: one-quarter, one-tenth, one-half, and a faction is a smaller portion of a larger group that breaks away from it. A faction might take a fraction of the people from a large group and start a new group.",
    "long": "The Latin source of the word faction means to \"do\" or \"make,\" though a faction can seem to be a taking away or un-doing. Politics is one area where faction gets a lot of use, because a political party often starts with a large group but has some members who disagree with a belief or direction. These members separate from the larger party and become a faction of their own, with many of the same beliefs as the original group but with a few new differences, too."
  },
  "transient": {
    "short": "Use the adjective transient to describe something that always changes or moves around. If your older brother is constantly moving from city to city, you can say he's transient.",
    "long": "Transient is most often used to modify nouns like nature, threat, source and cause, which suggests that the word  often shows up in formal contexts, like analysis of finance or global terrorism. But it can also be used for anything that moves quickly from one thing to another, like a transient feeling or facial expression. Transient is also a noun meaning \"a person who moves from place to place; a homeless person.\" The word comes from Latin transire, \"to pass over,\" so you can think of it as describing things that are quickly passed over."

If you pull the clothesline tight, you reduce the slack.

    "long": "\"The ordinary objects of human endeavor — property, outward success, luxury — have always seemed to me contemptible,\" wrote Albert Einstein. Presumably, NASA had loftier objects in mind when they named one of their space shuttles Endeavour, using the British spelling. The word comes from the Old French phrase mettre en deveir, or \"put in duty.\" As a verb, it's a more impressive word than try and suggests you're doing your darnedest to make something happen."

  "gauge": {
    "short": "If you ask your friend, \"How do you feel, generally, about loaning your car to people?\" your intention might be to gauge his reaction before you flat-out ask if you can borrow his car. To gauge is to measure or test.",

If you've ever seen someone check the air pressure in a tire, the instrument she used was called a tire gauge. The thickness, or diameter, of an item like wire (or the barrel of a gun) is another meaning of gauge."

  "dictate": {
    "short": "When you dictate something, you are giving orders — acting a bit like a dictator.",
    "long": "Dictate can also be used in a broader sense. Weather often dictates how many layers of clothes you wear, and the school rules dictate how you behave in and out of class. In a very different meaning, dictate means to say something out loud to a person or into a machine so it can be recorded. Up until fairly recently, bosses dictated letters and reports to secretaries who wrote them down."
  },
  "intrude": {
    "short": "When someone says, “I hate to intrude, but…” you can bet she is in fact going to interrupt your conversation or insert her opinion, even though it isn’t wanted. House burglars also intrude, but they don’t usually announce it first.",
    "long": "People can intrude in different ways, but it is usually uninvited and also unwelcome. This verb is derived from the Latin, intrudere, in which the in- means “into” and -trudere means, “to thrust.” So people can in intrude by thrusting or forcing themselves into your private life, your personal body space, or your home. Loud music could intrude into your studying.  A memory could intrude while you are trying to focus on texting a message."

    "short": "Something that's derogatory is insulting or disrespectful. If you make derogatory comments, that means you say things that are unflattering, unkind, or demeaning.",
    "long": "Derogatory means about the same as insulting. Derogatory language is meant to hurt, and it usually does. If you feel offended or insulted by what someone says, the person probably said something derogatory. Racial, sexist, and homophobic slurs are all derogatory. Insults that mean someone is stupid or crazy are derogatory. Making a joke about someone's mother is derogatory."

Things that are cathartic don't always call up tears. Things that make you scream, like a roller-coaster ride or a boxing match, are also cathartic. Whatever causes you to release a sudden flood of feelings is cathartic. Some therapies ask you to hit a pillow or break dishes, because those can be cathartic activities."

    "long": "Pressing business needs urgent attention, and pressing problems will turn into disasters if you don't figure out a quick way to solve them. Another meaning of pressing is \"the act of exerting a strong pressure,\" like the pressing of apples into delicious cider. Pressing comes from the verb press, \"to push against\" or \"to squeeze out,\" and later also \"to urge or argue for.\""

  "variety": {
    "short": "Variety is a quality similar to diversity or difference. Some feel having variety in life is much more exciting than doing the same routine day in and day out.",
    "long": "You’ve likely heard the expression “variety is the spice of life” to describe how our days are more interesting when different things happen. Variety can also describe different things that are classified under one category or type, like varieties of apple — granny smith, pink lady, or red delicious.

    "long": "Breaking apart the word analgesic helps with pronunciation, ann-ull-JEE-zick. This isn't a proper root-word study, but the last three letters of the word look like \"sick.\" If you're sick and have some pain and discomfort, you might get relief from an analgesic. As a noun, analgesic is the actual medicine, and as an adjective, it describes the effect of the medicine — a pill will have an analgesic effect, relieving the pain — unless it's really bad pain, in which case you'll need two."

    "long": "Some people are just naturally fun to be around; they sparkle, they animate any group they're part of, they're full of life.  That, in fact, is the root meaning of the word: it's from Latin vivere \"to live.\"  It has more of a sense of playfulness than lively or animated. Even the most sedentary slob can feel revitalized in the presence of a vivacious soul."

    "long": "The Old French flater originally meant \"to stroke or caress,\" which is what you do to people's egos when you flatter them. When you flatter, you probably want something — it could be as simple as wanting someone to like you. That's why people who meet celebrities tell them they're the greatest. More positively, if your hairstyle flatters your face, it emphasizes your best features."

  "multifarious": {
    "short": "A person or thing with many sides or different qualities is multifarious. The Internet has multifarious uses, museums are known for their multifarious art collections, and Hindu gods are associated with multifarious incarnations.",

    "long": "Today, although the religious meaning remains, the adjective heterodox can describe someone who adheres to any atypical beliefs, such as scientists who buck the current thinking or politicians who do not toe the party line. The word can be a synonym of heretical, which describes someone with contrary beliefs. If you are a teacher with a heterodox teaching style, you may win over students but alarm your more traditional colleagues."

  "hunch": {
    "short": "When you pose for pictures with short friends, you hunch over so you don't tower above them — you scrunch up your shoulders, bend your knees, and try to look smaller.",
    "long": "You can also have a hunch, which has nothing to do with scrunching. When you have a hunch about something, you think it might be true. Your dog bolts over the fence, and you have a hunch he's heading for the neighbor who feeds him pâté. Hunch is an odd word of unknown origin, which seems to have originally meant \"to push or shove\" — to nudge."

  "convection": {
    "short": "Convection is the circular motion that happens when warmer air or liquid — which has faster moving molecules, making it less dense — rises, while the cooler air or liquid drops down.",
    "long": "Convection is a major factor in weather. The sun heats the earth’s surface, then, when cooler air comes into contact with it, the air warms and rises, creating an upward current in the atmosphere. That current can result in wind, clouds, or other weather. Convection currents within the earth move layers of magma, and convection in the ocean creates currents. Convection ovens use fans to circulate heat so that whatever you're cooking cooks faster and more evenly."
  },
  "overbearing": {
    "short": "Overbearing means domineering. You might find it difficult to play the piano as your overbearing instructor criticizes every key you touch.",
    "long": "The adjective overbearing typically describes a person who is haughty and dictatorial. Someone considered to be overbearing or arrogant wouldn't be described as kind or modest, which are antonyms of overbearing. Overbearing also means “repressing or overwhelming.” Thomas Jefferson uses this definition in his decree, “If the freedom of religion, guaranteed to us by law in theory, can ever rise in practice under the overbearing inquisition of public opinion, then and only then will truth, prevail over fanaticism.”"
  },
  "presume": {
    "short": "If you presume something, it means you act as though it's true before all the evidence is in. If you are presumed to be the fastest runner, don't get too cocky — that word implies that you haven't actually raced yet.",
    "long": "To presume is to take something for granted. The famous quote “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” comes from the explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who ran into the explorer David Livingstone in the wilds of Africa in 1871. It’s funny because these were the only two white men known to be in that part of Africa at the time."
  },
  "pluck": {
    "short": "To pluck is to pick or pull a single item out of many, like a flower or a hair. As a noun, pluck is energy or enthusiasm, even when things are looking grim.",
    "long": "Don't pluck only the best cherries off the tree: that's cherry-picking! Before you cook a goose, you need to pluck its feathers. If it looks like your goose is cooked, however, then show some pluck, and figure out a way to save yourself. Some characters who are famous for showing pluck include the Artful Dodger, Little Orphan Annie, and Benji the dog. They all kept their chins up and kept on trying, even when things looked really dark."
  },
  "suffice": {
    "short": "To suffice is to be enough, in either quality or quantity. It may not be gourmet all the time, but if your food is healthy, it will suffice.",
    "long": "The word suffice comes from a combination of the Latin words sub (\"under\") and facere (\"make\") that together mean \"meet the need of.\" This need is usually the bare minimum — no leftovers, nothing fancy. The common phrase \"Suffice it to say\" means \"I'll just say\" or \"All that needs to be said is....\""
  },
  "umbrella": {
    "short": "An umbrella is the gizmo used to protect yourself from rain or sun. An umbrella can also be something that groups similar things, like an umbrella organization that protects and serves many smaller organizations.",
    "long": "An umbrella is that lightweight, collapsible cover that’s handy on a rainy day. People also use umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun. Since an umbrella covers people and things, umbrella is also a metaphor for something that brings unity. An umbrella agency brings together other smaller and related agencies. An umbrella term can be applied to many concepts. To bring things together in this way is to umbrella, as in “The merger umbrellas several companies.”"
  },
  "brandish": {
    "short": "To brandish something is to wave it about aggressively, as one might brandish a sword or tennis racket (if it's a particularly intense game).",
    "long": "Brandish often implies that a person is wielding a physical weapon. In fact, brandish comes from the archaic French word brandir, meaning “sword.” However, it’s also possible to brandish objects that aren’t weapons. If you win a bowling tournament, for example, you might be inclined to brandish your shiny new trophy in front of the other competitors. Be careful, though; they might mistake your trophy for a \"brandir\" and respond accordingly."
  },
  "curmudgeon": {
    "short": "Old, cranky, and more than a little stubborn, a curmudgeon is the gruff, grey-haired neighbor who refuses to hand out candy at Halloween and shoos away holiday carolers with a \"bah humbug!\"",
    "long": "As fickle and stubborn as the type of person it describes, curmudgeon comes to us without a history, its origins undisclosed. It was originally believed to have come from coeur mechant, the French phrase for “evil heart,” but that theory has been long discarded. Don't worry though, you’ll know a curmudgeon when you see one: He’ll be ill-tempered and miserly, eager to shake his fist and spout disagreeable opinions."

  "cognoscente": {
    "short": "Someone who's extremely proficient or knowledgeable about a particular subject can be called a cognoscente. Your deep appreciation for the books of J.R.R. Tolkein makes you a cognoscente of Lord of the Rings.",
    "long": "This word is often used in its plural form, cognoscenti, referring to a whole class of experts or connoisseurs: \"The cognoscenti of sports disagree about who was the greatest basketball player in history.\" Cognoscente comes to English from Italian and goes back to a Latin root, cognoscere, \"get to know.\" Spend a little extra time learning your word lists, and you'll soon be a cognoscente of vocabulary!"
  },
  "purport": {
    "short": "Use purport when you want to convince people about something that might not be true, like when you purport that the dog ate your homework.",
    "long": "The verb purport can mean \"to claim\" — whether you mean it or not — or \"to intend,\" like when you purport to study all night. So it makes sense that as a noun, purport means the intention or purpose, like the purport of a political candidate's speech was to get your vote. If the speech was long and hard to follow, you might be lucky just to get the purport, which here means \"the main point or meaning.\""
  },
  "authoritative": {
    "short": "Speak with an authoritative tone, or no one will listen to you. Why would they, if you sound like you don't even believe in yourself? Authoritative means sure or definitive.",
    "long": "When writing a paper, it can be useful to quote from an authoritative source, such as the encyclopedia, but you must also do enough research that you are fluent in your subject and can speak with the authoritative voice only true immersion can produce."
  },
  "genesis": {
    "short": "When you talk about the genesis of something, you're talking about where it began. The genesis of hip-hop music was the party scene in New York City’s South Bronx in the 1970s.",
    "long": "The Jewish Torah and the Christian Scriptures begin with the book of Genesis, which describes God separating light from darkness and creating the universe. Genesis is the very start of something, its birth. But you probably wouldn't refer to your own birth as a genesis.  When you describe something as a genesis, you're usually referring to the beginning of a movement or an idea."
  },
  "opus": {
    "short": "An opus is a created work, usually musical in nature. The composer's greatest opus was inspired by the blooming of the spring flowers.",
    "long": "While an opus is a piece of work, usually musical, the best way to remember it is to know that the preferred plural of opus is opera which everyone associates with music. You can also say opuses for the plural if you want, but how is that going to help you remember anything? A common usage of opus is with the term magnum opus which refers to one’s greatest work, musical or otherwise."
  },
  "contempt": {
    "short": "Reserve the noun contempt for an extreme lack of respect: a food snob has nothing but contempt for mass-produced burgers and fries at a fast-food joint.",
    "long": "Contempt has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere \"to despise,\" and if you despise someone, you have contempt for them. It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than either disdain or scorn.  It suggests you find someone or something utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words \"Big Mac\" or \"Whopper\" with a voice dripping in contempt."
  },
  "leash": {
    "short": "Dog owners who live in the city need a leash, a rope or cord attached to the dog's collar that helps his owner keep him safe and restrained.",
    "long": "When you walk a dog, you hold his leash to guide him along the sidewalk and keep him from chasing squirrels into busy streets. The word leash is also useful for describing a figurative kind of guide or restraint: \"The teachers at that school keep their students on a short leash when they take field trips downtown.\" The students aren't on actual leashes, but they are constrained. Leash comes from the Old French word laissier, or \"loose.\""
  },
  "vain": {
    "short": "If you spend all day admiring yourself in reflective surfaces — mirrors, pools of water, the backs of spoons — people may think you are conceited, or vain.",
    "long": "Vain is from Latin vanus, \"empty,\" and in English it originally meant \"lacking value or effect, futile,\" like your vain attempt to find a pencil in your messy, overstuffed backpack. Likewise, the phrase \"in vain\" means \"without success.\" Vain also means \"conceited, too proud of oneself.\"  Carly Simon's line \"You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you\" is an excellent illustration of this use."
  },
  "servile": {
    "short": "Servile describes someone who is almost aggressively helpful, like a teacher’s pet who insists on bringing an apple every day even though the teacher doesn’t want it. To call someone servile is an insult.",
    "long": "To remember servile, think of the word servant — they both derive from the Latin servus, \"enslaved person.\" The Servile Wars, for example, refer to slave revolts in the Roman Empire. These days, servile describes someone who is so eager to please that it makes you cringe. If you apologize when someone else steps on your foot, you’re being servile."
  },
  "extrovert": {
    "short": "An extrovert is a friendly person who enjoys talking to and being with other people. Extroverts love parties, talking on the phone, and meeting new people.",
    "long": "This noun has a specialized sense in psychology, and its opposite is introvert. Psychologists sometimes kick it old school and spell it extravert. As a psychological term, it was borrowed from German extravertiert, from the prefix extra-, \"outside, beyond\" plus Latin vertere, \"to turn.\" Thanks, Carl Jung! Its opposite is introvert, which means shy or turned inward."
  },
  "discrete": {
    "short": "Discrete means separate or divided. A discrete unit is a separate part of something larger. A room is a discrete space within a house, just as the crankshaft is a discrete part of a car engine.",
    "long": "If something is discrete, it has its own space. An ice cube comes from an ice tray, but it has its own discrete compartment. A student government might have discrete committees for different projects. Don't confuse discrete with its close cousin discreet, which means “appropriately private.” Billionaire Bruce Wayne, for example, is very discreet about his secret life as Batman. You could say Batman is a discrete, or separate, part of Bruce Wayne’s identity. Anything distinct and separated is discrete."
  },
  "reprove": {
    "short": "If you get into trouble and are sent to the principal’s office, be prepared for the principal to reprove you for your behavior. To reprove is to scold, reprimand, or — in plain English — “chew out.”",
    "long": "Reprove is a verb used in the same way as “scold,” or “dress down.” To reprove is to express your dissatisfaction or disapproval with something. It’s a less severe word than denounce or decry. It is closer to the verb criticize. Your parents might reprove you for a minor offense like not cleaning your room or chewing with your mouth open. And, for the record, reprove is not the root word prove with the prefix re- as if to mean “prove again.” If you use it that way, someone would likely reprove you."
  },
  "opprobrious": {
    "short": "Opprobrious is a heavy-duty word to describe something taunting or shameful. Opprobrious words criticize in a mean, hurtful way.",
    "long": "Opprobrious comes from the Latin opprobare which means \"to reproach or taunt.\" If someone is being opprobrious, she's being abusive and mean. Insults are opprobrious, while constructive criticism is not. No one wants to be treated in an opprobrious way. We can also use this word for bad behavior that causes shame — someone cheating on a test is opprobrious. Opprobrious actions are disgraceful, ignominious, and inglorious."
  },
  "attenuate": {
    "short": "Attenuate is a verb that means to make or become weaker. The effects of aging may be attenuated by exercise — or by drinking from the fountain of youth.",
    "long": "The versatile word attenuate denotes a weakening in amount, intensity, or value. As a verb, attenuate is usually transitive, meaning it needs an object to be complete, such as in the sentence: \"This tanning process tends to attenuate the deer hide, making it softer.\" The word can be intransitive in past tense, as in \"The rain attenuated, ending the storm.\"  And it can even be used as an adjective to describe something weakened: \"Even an attenuated solution will remove the stain.\""
  },
  "disprove": {
    "short": "When you disprove something, you argue against it or give evidence that it's not true. A student falsely accused of cheating on a test will work hard to disprove it.",
    "long": "Even though it took years to be acknowledged, Galileo's theory that the planets revolve around the sun managed eventually to disprove previous ideas that the Earth was at the center of the universe. If your friends think your family is ridiculously wealthy, you can disprove this idea by showing them the tiny house you live in and the beat up old car your dad drives. The Old French source of disprove is desprover, \"refute or contradict.\""
  },
  "disburse": {
    "short": "If someone wants to disburse funds to you, stick around — it means they're going to give you money!",
    "long": "Disburse is a fancy, financial word that is just an official way of saying to pay or give out money. Parents don't disburse allowance money, they give it, and if your friend owes you five bucks, he'll pay you what he owes. On the other hand, lawyers disburse funds from a will. The government disburses money for grants and federal projects. And if you get a mortgage, the bank disburses a check to the seller of the house you bought."
  },
  "prefigure": {
    "short": "Something that is a sign of things to come can be said to prefigure the future thing — and usually not in a good way.",
    "long": "Sleeping through your alarm Monday morning might prefigure your entire week — in other words, it might be a sign of the unlucky days ahead.English is rich in terms that have the basic meaning of \"tell something about the future.\" Perhaps because we all wish we knew more about it! The Latin root of prefigure is praefigurare, from prae, \"before,\" and figurare , \"to form or shape.\""
  },
  "novelty": {
    "short": "Novelty is a newness or refreshing quality. Many college freshmen enjoy the novelty of living on their own — until it comes time to do that first load of laundry.",
    "long": "You'll often hear people talk about the novelty of a new experience —  imagine the excitement and anticipation of cracking open a novel you’ve never read before to help remember the word. But novelty is also a term for a small toy or trinket, usually mass-produced. Novelty shops sell all kinds of funny knickknacks, from personalized flashlight key chains to stuffed singing hamsters."
  },
  "shard": {
    "short": "If you break a mirror, the thin sharp pieces you want to avoid are shards. A shard is simply a broken piece of metal, glass, stone, or pottery with sharp edges.",
    "long": "Don't confuse shard with shred, meaning to cut into strips, or chard, a leafy green vegetable. You could use a shard of metal to shred chard into salad, but be careful that you don't cut your hands to shreds!"
  },
  "atom": {
    "short": "An atom is the basic unit of an element. When you see the chemical formula for water, H2O, it's telling you that each molecule of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.",
    "long": "In science class, you've probably come across atoms, the bits that make up molecules. Less scientifically, the word atom can also mean a very small piece of anything at all. The Greek root of atom is atomos, which means \"indivisible,\" since the scientists who first gave the atom its name imagined it couldn't be split or divided into smaller pieces. Even though we know there are smaller things that make up an atom (protons, neutrons and electrons), it's still a good way to think about the word atom."
  },
  "quirk": {
    "short": "A quirk is a unique, odd, and sometimes charming trait that makes a person stand out from the crowd. Country comedian Minnie Pearl was known for her quirk of wearing a $1.98 price tag dangling from her hat.",
    "long": "A quirk can be an adorable little habit, like wearing flowery dresses and big sun bonnets  or bow ties every day. Someone who has one or many quirks is said to be quirky — a little odd, but usually in a fun way. When it's not being used to describe people's unusual traits, quirk can mean a quick curve, or a groove, that runs along or separates the molding in a building."
  },
  "perennial": {
    "short": "Perennial typically describes things that are permanent, constant, or repeated. If you fight with your parents every year over whether they really must invite your annoying cousins for Thanksgiving, you could call that a perennial conflict.",
    "long": "Arguing with your roommate about who cleaned the bathroom last time might be a perennial argument. There is also a perennial plant, which lasts more than two years and usually reappears each spring, because it produces flowers and seeds from the same root structure. Perennial comes from the Latin perennis, from the prefix per-, \"through,\" plus annus, or \"year.\" Annus is also the source of our English word annual — an annual plant lives only one year or season."
  },
  "tenacious": {
    "short": "Use tenacious to mean \"not easily letting go or giving up,\" like a clingy child who has a tenacious grip on his mother's hand.",
    "long": "A strong grip or an unyielding advocate might both be described as tenacious, a word whose synonyms include resolute, firm, and persistent. The word comes from the Latin root tenax, which means \"holding fast.\" The basketball commentator Marv Albert, impressed by a defender's skill, once uttered the sound bite, \"That's some tenacious D!\" (\"D\" is short for \"defense.\") The musicians Jack Black and Kyle Gass borrowed the phrase for the name of their comedy-rock band, Tenacious D."

    "short": "An illusion is something that isn't real. It may look real, but it's actually fake — just a crafty construction or fantasy. Like the old rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick practiced by magicians around the globe.",
    "long": "An illusion is an act of deception. Some optical illusions are pretty cool to watch, but an illusion can also point to an erroneous belief or false perception of reality, which is where you start getting into hallucination territory — seeing things that aren't there. You can give the illusion that you’re fascinated by your professor’s lecture by chewing on your pencil, furrowing your brow, and making sure to nod enthusiastically every so often."

  "largesse": {
    "short": "Largesse is extreme generosity. If your neighbors bring you an expensive watch from Switzerland because you fed their cat while they were traveling, thank them for their largesse.",
    "long": "Though pronounced \"lar JESS,\" the word largesse looks sort of like largeness. That's an easy way to remember what largesse means: think of it as largeness of spirit. Largesse can describe the generosity of someone giving gifts, or it can describe the gift itself. You could dispense largess by buying your brother a dinner at a fancy restaurant for helping you out."
  },
  "seditious": {
    "short": "Something seditious works against a government. When countries overthrow authoritarian dictators, often the people engage in seditious protests until the dictator has to leave.",
    "long": "Seditious, pronounced \"si-DI-shes,\" comes from the Latin seditionem meaning \"civil disorder, dissention.\" A seditious act rebels against a government or authority.  In some countries just saying seditious remarks against a government can land you in jail, especially if what you say is likely to get people to rise up against the government. If you plot against the current power structure in any way, you're being seditious."

  "bent": {
    "short": "If you have a knack or aptitude for doing something, you can say you have a bent for it. Perhaps you have a bent for  woodworking, creating fabulous desserts, or writing poetry, you are good at it.",
    "long": "The noun bent can also refer to a strong inclination to react to something in a specific manner. If you have a strong scientific bent, you won't be inclined to believe reports of alien spaceship landings and Loch Ness Monster sightings. As an adjective, bent describes someone very determined, and in this case, the word is usually followed by \"on.\" You may be bent on the kids going to bed early, but they may have other ideas: party in the living room!"

  "abstract": {
    "short": "Use the adjective abstract for something that is not a material object or is general and not based on specific examples.",
    "long": "Abstract is from a Latin word meaning \"pulled away, detached,\" and the basic idea is of something detached from physical, or concrete, reality. It is frequently used of ideas, meaning that they don't have a clear applicability to real life, and of art, meaning that it doesn't pictorially represent reality. It is also used as a noun, especially in the phrase \"in the abstract\" (a joke has a person laying down a new sidewalk saying \"I like little boys in the abstract, but not in the concrete\"), and as a verb (accented on the second syllable), meaning \"to remove.\""

    "long": "Announce has some subtler meanings as well—you might inadvertently announce your attention to go for the basket by looking at it during a game. You might very intentionally announce that you are never eating pizza again, if you want everyone you know to be aware of this."

  "sinister": {
    "short": "People who are left-handed might feel unlucky having to use a desk designed for right-handers, but there probably wasn't any sinister, or evil, intent behind the design. Or was there?",
    "long": "In the 15th century, when the word sinister came into use in English, people who were left-handed were thought to be bad luck or even evil. In his play Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote of the villain holding a human skull in his sinister — i.e., left — hand. It would seem to be sinister, or wicked, enough to see a human skull in the right hand, not to mention unlucky for the person missing a head in the first place."

  "caveat": {
    "short": "A caveat is a warning. When someone adds a caveat to something they’re telling you to beware — maybe what they’re telling you comes with certain conditions or maybe there’s something dangerous lurking.",
    "long": "When your new friend gives you directions to her house, and then says, “The caveat is that when it snows the driveway turns into an ice rink,” she's warning you that your travels could be dangerous. Caveat is also a legal term for when a lawyer asks for a break in proceedings. If a lawyer issues a caveat, she's filing a formal notice to suspend a trial until her client gets a hearing."

    "short": "If you think public officials are nothing but a bunch of greedy buffoons, you have a cynical attitude about politics.",

Mencken was famous for saying cynical things like, \"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.\" The original Cynics were ancient Greek philosophers who never had a good word to say about anyone. The Greek word kynikos actually means \"canine,\" maybe because all of that sneering seemed a little dog-like."

    "short": "Call something seminal when it's so original, so groundbreaking and awesome that it will influence everything that comes after it. Picasso produced more than a few seminal works of art, for example.",
    "long": "Technically, seminal means something related to semen or seeds. But these days people more often use the word to describe something  that plants the seed for creative growth. An innovative piece of music or literature, a fresh new idea, or an invention that changes everything could each be called seminal. Synonyms include critical, fundamental, original, and primary."

  "errand": {
    "short": "An errand is a short trip to fulfill some small business. When you’re running errands, you’re making a bunch of these all at once.",
    "long": "The noun errand can refer to the mission of the trip itself. If the lines are always long at the bank, then banking may be your least favorite errand. If you are off on a wild goose chase, you may be out on a fool's errand. If you are taking food or clothing to someone in need, then you are on an errand of mercy."

    "long": "You might think dialectical refers to how people speak in a certain region or in a specific group, such as a regional accent. That version of dialect comes from the Greek word dialektos, meaning \"discourse, way of speaking.\" But dialectical instead comes from the French word dialecte, meaning \"denoting the art of investigating the truth of opinions.\" It has to do with a method of reasoning used to determine the truth."
  },
  "peer": {
    "short": "A peer is someone at your own level. If you are a 10th grader, other high school students are your peers.",
    "long": "Peer comes from the Latin par which means equal. When you are on par with someone, you are their peer. If kids your age are pressuring you to do something you don't want to do, that's peer pressure. In the sport of basketball, Michael Jordan was without peer, no one could equal his talent. When he switched to baseball, he found himself to be among peers again."

  "tepid": {
    "short": "Tepid means lukewarm or half-hearted. If the applause for your mime-on-a-unicycle performance was more tepid than enthusiastic, it might be time to find a new hobby.",
    "long": "Around 1400, the word tepid evolved from the Latin tepidus, an adjective meaning “lukewarm,” which before that came about from the Latin tepere, a verb meaning “to be warm.” Tepid people or things are lukewarm or lacking in enthusiasm or emotion. Bathwater that’s been sitting in the tub for two hours is probably tepid. So was the hug you gave your least favorite ex when you ran into him at the movie theater."

The adverb fitfully, which is great for describing this kind of on-and-off behavior, movement, or feeling, comes from the adjective fitful, which was used originally by Shakespeare to mean \"suffering fits\" and then by Romantic poets in the 18th century to mean \"changing and shifting.\""
  },
  "slake": {
    "short": "When you slake something, such as a desire or a thirst, you satisfy it. A big glass of lemonade on a hot summer day will slake your thirst.",
    "long": "The word slake traces back to the Old English word slacian, meaning to “become less eager.” If you slake something, like thirst, you become less eager to drink. In other words, you are less thirsty. Like satisfy and quench, close relatives of slake in meaning, the word is used to indicate that a craving is made less intense by getting whatever it is that you crave."
  },
  "rebut": {
    "short": "To rebut is to argue against something. If your parents say you're too young and irresponsible to drive, you can rebut their claim by ticking off examples of your responsibility.",
    "long": "When you argue against something, you rebut that position or argument. Your school's principal might rebut your teacher's argument that the class is overcrowded by pointing out that there could legally be five more kids in the class. The teacher could rebut the principal's rebuttal by observing that there aren't enough books or seats for the kids in the classroom now. Rebut comes from an old French word rebuter, meaning \"to thrust back.\""
  },
  "depict": {
    "short": "When you depict something, you draw a picture of it, describe it, or show what it looks like. So grab a crayon, a paint brush, or even an Etch-A-Sketch and start depicting.",
    "long": "From the Latin depictus, meaning “to portray, paint, sketch, describe,” depict is a way to communicate what you see. To explain to an alien what a banana is, you can either depict it with drawings, describe it in words, or both. But be careful. Writes author Joyce Maynard, \"The painter who feels obligated to depict his subjects as uniformly beautiful or handsome and without flaws will fall short of making art.\""
  },
  "noxious": {
    "short": "Something noxious is harmful and could be even fatal — whether it is colorless, odorless, and invisible like carbon monoxide, or dark, strong-smelling, and obvious, like black smoke from a fire. People are called noxious too when they hurt others with cruelty or mental anguish.",
    "long": "English and Latin roots for noxious are related to the meanings of \"harm,\" \"damage,\" and \"injury.\" While obnoxious might come to mind when seeing the word noxious, obnoxious is a much less damaging adjective to describe someone annoying. Most uses for noxious involve real physical or emotional damage unless the word is used in exaggeration. Examples range from \"the noxious gas fumes made the dog pass out\" to \"his cologne was so noxious I had to exit the elevator and take the stairs.\""
  },
  "conspiracy": {
    "short": "A conspiracy is a secret agreement between two or more people to commit an unlawful or harmful act. Conspiracy theorists are people who believe that the government is secretly controlled by power brokers in flagrant violation of the constitution.",
    "long": "Conspiracy can also refer to the act of planning an unlawful or harmful act: Terrorists might be  accused of organizing a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Conspiracy is ultimately from Latin cōnspīrāre \"to agree or plot together, literally to breathe together.\" The corresponding English verb is conspire."
  },
  "rigorous": {
    "short": "If you are rigorous when you do something, you do it extremely carefully and precisely. A rigorous inspection of your tax records has revealed the government owes you money. Congratulations!",
    "long": "The Latin root for rigorous is rigor, meaning “stiffness.” This might remind you of rigor mortis, the stiffening of a body after death, as often seen on cop shows. This is a good, if creepy, way of remembering the meaning of rigorous: rigorous people are stiff and unbending about the standards of their work. This requires being alive, of course."
  },
  "ramify": {
    "short": "The verb ramify describes something that branches off or spreads, like the new subway lines that ramify across your city and reach even the neighborhoods farthest from the center.",
    "long": "Ramify came into English through French, but it traces all the way back to the Latin word ramus, meaning \"branch.\" It can describe things that literally branch out in segments, or it can be used figuratively to describe things that spread, like the effects of a new policy that ramify through your school. Ramify might seem like a strange word, but you probably know the related word ramification, a consequence that stems — or branches — from some other action."
  },
  "serendipitous": {
    "short": "Serendipitous is an adjective that describes accidentally being in the right place at the right time, like bumping into a good friend in some unusual location, or finding a hundred dollar bill on the ground.",
    "long": "The root of serendipitous comes from the fairy tale \"The Three Princes of Serendip,\" in which three princes make one lucky and surprising discovery after another.  A serendipitous moment happens by accident, usually when you’re doing something completely unrelated, like digging a hole in your yard to bury your hamster and finding a treasure chest of jewels.  That’s a sad but serendipitous funeral."
  },
  "forsake": {
    "short": "To forsake another person is to leave them entirely, usually in a moment of need.",
    "long": "Forsake may mean simply giving something up, such as a way of life or a homeland, for something better or more appropriate. But it is often a mean word, suggesting leaving something or someone behind when they need you to stay. One way to remember the meaning of this verb — to abandon or desert — is to remember this little sentence: \"For heaven's sake, don't leave me, or heaven is lost!\" Lose the heaven, and you have forsake."
  },
  "sloppy": {
    "short": "Sloppy means \"untidy\" or \"messy.\" If your bedroom has clothes all over the floor, it's sloppy. And, if you end up with food all over your shirt every time you eat something, you're sloppy.",
    "long": "Besides \"out of order\" or \"not clean,\" sloppy can also mean \"careless\" or \"overemotional.\" So you might do a sloppy job on an important paper for school. Or you might go to a sad movie and cry while you watch it, even though you know it's sloppy and sentimental. The original 18th century meaning of this adjective was simply \"muddy.\" And before it meant \"ground beef sandwich on a bun,\" a sloppy joe was a \"loose, messy sweater.\""
  },
  "confine": {
    "short": "Confine is all about setting limits. If you are confined to the house, it means you can't leave it. If you're really sick, you might be confined to your bed.",
    "long": "Confine can be used abstractly as well. In writing a term paper, your teacher might tell you to confine your examples to ones that you can support with direct evidence. In the 19th century, pregnancy and childbirth were often referred to as a woman's confinement—a time when she couldn't get up or out."
  },
  "proctor": {
    "short": "A proctor keeps an eye on students who are taking a test to make sure they don't cheat. The invention of the cell phone has certainly made proctors' lives tougher.",
    "long": "For college entrance exams, students are often supervised by a professional proctor, while in less official situations, like a pop quiz, the proctor is usually the teacher herself. Proctor is both a noun and a verb, so you might say that a proctor's job is to proctor, or make sure no test-takers' eyes are straying. The Latin root word is procuratorem, which means \"manager.\""
  },
  "inexplicable": {
    "short": "Something inexplicable can't be explained. It doesn't make sense. You don't want to come to the beach on the most beautiful day of the year? That's inexplicable!",
    "long": "Inexplicable is made up of the prefix in, which means \"not,\" and explicable, which comes from the Latin explicabilis, meaning \"unfolded, unraveled.\" Do you see the double negative? If something is not unfolded, it's folded up and tangled — like something that doesn't make sense. Your school's decision to call a snow day is inexplicable, if there's barely a layer of snow on the ground."
  },
  "cacophonous": {
    "short": "The adjective cacophonous describes loud, harsh sounds, like the cacophonous racket your brother and his band mates make while trying to learn how to play their instruments.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce cacophonous, accent the second syllable: \"cuh-CAW-fuh-nus.\" It is related to the Greek words kakos, meaning \"bad, evil,\" and phone, or \"voice.\" You may feel like you're facing something evil if you’re bombarded by the cacophonous sounds of, say, political pundits yelling at one another, or the chaotic sounds of traffic and voices on a busy urban street. Cacophonous is the opposite of harmonious."
  },
  "univocal": {
    "short": "Something that's univocal is so clear that there's only one way to interpret it. A dog that's growling ferociously and baring its teeth is sending a univocal message to keep your distance.",
    "long": "You might also call univocal things \"unambiguous.\" There's no way to misunderstand something that's truly univocal — its meaning is consistent and obvious. Your mom's univocal instruction to be home by 9:00 PM leaves no room for doubt: she means 9:00, not 9:30 or 10:15. This adjective is most often used in linguistics to talk about words, and its Latin roots are uni-, \"having only one,\" and vox, \"voice.\""
  },
  "proscribe": {
    "short": "To proscribe something is to forbid or prohibit it, as a school principal might proscribe the use of cell phones in class.",
    "long": "Proscribe sounds similar to the word prescribe, but be careful: these words are essentially opposite in meaning. While proscribe means forbid, prescribe is used when a doctor recommends a medicine or remedy. Of course, if you want an excuse for not following your doctor’s orders, you could say you were confused about the meaning of these two words — but that would be lying, which is proscribed by most people’s value systems. And it would also be bad for your health."
  },
  "obese": {
    "short": "Obese means excessively fat. In medical terms, it means you have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, at which point your body's excess fat begins to threaten your health.",
    "long": "In the last third of the 20th century and into the 21st, increasing numbers of Americans are obese, in what health professionals call \"an obesity epidemic\"; they attribute it to rising portion-sizes, increased consumption of processed food, the demise of family meals, and food marketing, among other factors."
  },
  "prolific": {
    "short": "Someone or something that is prolific is fruitful or highly productive. A prolific songwriter can churn out five hit tunes before breakfast.",
    "long": "A prolific writer cranks out two novels a year, and a prolific rabbit has baby bunnies every few months. The word comes from combining the medieval Latin prolificus (“offspring”) with a form of facere (“to make or do”). It can also connote something taking root and growing, like prolific poison ivy that takes over the yard."
  },
  "perimeter": {
    "short": "The noun perimeter refers to the border of an enclosed space. The perimeter of a house is its property line. For a country, it would be that country’s borders.",
    "long": "From Latin, meaning “around” (peri)and “measure” (metron), a perimeter is basically a boundary of any kind, measuring around the shape. In mathematics, perimeter refers to the length of this boundary. In geometry class, you might be asked to calculate the perimeter of a polygon, which is the sum of the length of each side. You might also hear this word used by members of the military or a police force as in “secure the perimeter” or “the perimeter has been breached.” A basketball player that likes to shoot from the three point line is said to “operate on the perimeter.”"
  },
  "enlist": {
    "short": "To enlist is to voluntarily join the military. You may have seen television commercials or posters encouraging people to enlist.",
    "long": "There are various ways people end up in the military. Sometimes there's a draft, which selects people whether they want to go or not. Sometimes people enlist, which means they sign up on their own. Enlisting also refers to recruiting or hiring people for some purpose or organization. If you are moving, you might try to enlist your friends to help — good luck with that."
  },
  "taciturn": {
    "short": "Someone who is taciturn is reserved, not loud and talkative. The word itself refers to the trait of reticence, of seeming aloof and uncommunicative. A taciturn person might be snobby, naturally quiet, or just shy.",
    "long": "Having its origin in the Latin tacitus, \"silent,\" taciturn came to be used in mid-18th-century English in the sense \"habitually silent.\" Taciturnity is often considered a negative trait, as it suggests someone uncommunicative and too quiet. Jane Austen wrote, \"We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the éclat of a proverb.\""
  },
  "ranger": {
    "short": "A ranger is a person who takes care of a park or a piece of land. A park ranger makes sure the rules are followed and provides information to visitors.",
    "long": "Someone who takes a job as a forest ranger might patrol an area of wooded land, watching for fire danger and enforcing the rules. A ranger's tasks can vary from teaching kids about local plants and animals to fighting fires to arresting people who break laws in a state or national park. The original rangers were British employees of the king or queen who would \"range\" throughout the woods looking for poachers — people who illegally hunted on royal land."
  },
  "metaphysics": {
    "short": "Metaphysics is the philosophical study of being and knowing. If you have ever contemplated your own existence in the universe, you were dabbling in metaphysics.",
    "long": "Metaphysics comes from the Greek meta ta physika (\"the works after the Physics\"), which refers those of Aristotle's writings that followed the natural sciences. This field of inquiry was later understood as \"the science of things transcending what is physical and natural,\" like the existence of god or the origin of human knowledge. Metaphysics must therefore rely on philosophical logic, rather than scientific experiments, in exploring these questions."
  },
  "longevity": {
    "short": "Something with longevity has the ability to last for a long time. While tortoises are not known for their quickness, their longevity is amazing. Just ask the Hare.",
    "long": "At the root of longevity is the word long. So when you see longevity, think “a long time.\" In fact, this word has some serious longevity, since it's been around since the 1600s. Longevity is most commonly used to describe the length of one’s lifetime, but it can also mean a long duration, such as one’s longevity working for a certain company for an extended period of time."
  },
  "kindle": {
    "short": "When you start a fire burning, you can say you kindle the fire. Knowing how to kindle a campfire is an important survival skill. It can help keep you warm at night, and keep you from eating cold beans for dinner.",
    "long": "The verb kindle not only means to start a fire, but also to catch fire. Another meaning for kindle is to arouse interest or passion. A dynamic music teacher could kindle the students' interest in learning an instrument. Or, romance can also be kindled: \"As they danced together, a spark of romance kindled between them.\""
  },
  "deviant": {
    "short": "A deviant is someone whose behavior falls far outside of society's norms; as an adjective, deviant can describe the behavior itself. For example, a fifty-year-old punk rocker has a deviant appearance, compared to his peers.",
    "long": "That aging punk deviates, or departs from the norm, of people his age. Both deviant and deviate come from the Latin word deviare, meaning \"to turn out of the way.\" Deviants experience this turning away from society, either by choice, or in the case of someone who has harmed another, perhaps by sexual abuse, by being cast out by people who want nothing to do with them."
  },
  "obtrude": {
    "short": "If you want to be rude, you'll obtrude, or thrust yourself to the front of a line without waiting.",
    "long": "Who asked you? If the answer is no one, chances are you've decided to obtrude or shove your ideas and opinions into everyone's face. Obtrude has its origins in the Latin ob meaning \"toward\" and trudere meaning \"to thrust.\" An intruder climbing through your kitchen window is someone who chooses to obtrude, or forcefully enter your home."
  },
  "expense": {
    "short": "An expense is a cost, but you can also use this word to mean the figurative cost of something. If you find it embarrassing to dress up as Santa, you might say that you do it to amuse your nephews, at the expense of your pride.",
    "long": "When you give one thing up in order to get something else, its cost or sacrifice is the expense of getting what you want. You might worry that politicians want to cut taxes at the expense of schools that need money, or that oil companies increase drilling at the expense of the environment. The root of expense the Latin expendere, \"to weigh out money or pay down.\""
  },
  "odious": {
    "short": "If something is odious, it's hateful. If you become a historian of slavery, you'll learn all the details of that odious trade.",
    "long": "Odious is from the Latin noun odium, which means hatred. It is a strong word, so don't call someone odious unless you want to accuse someone of being loathsome or vile. Actions can also be called odious. A typical use is Shakespeare's in Othello: \"You told a lie, an odious damned lie.\" Some synonyms are hateful, contemptible, detestable, and abominable."
  },
  "dabble": {
    "short": "You dabble when you are a little bit involved in an activity, such as an art form or a hobby. Maybe you only dabble in mystery novels, but you are very knowledgeable about comic books.",
    "long": "The word dabble can also often relate to water. It can mean “to splash playfully,” or “to get just a little wet.” A bird can also dabble in water by dipping its bill into it. Each of these meanings of dabble is often followed by the word in. For example, a duck may dabble in the water (and then dribble a few drops afterward from its bill), and you may dabble in shrubbery art."
  },
  "orotund": {
    "short": "If the reviews of your concert describe your singing as orotund, you can pop open the champagne — your reviewers have noticed your full, rich sound.",
    "long": "On the other hand, if you've just given a speech and the TV commentators ridicule it as orotund, moralistic, and meaningless, you might want to drop out of sight for a few weeks. You've been called out for your pompous, self-important style. Orotund comes from the Latin word ore, \"mouth,\" and rotundo, \"make round.\" So orotund sounds are what you make with a rounded mouth, which is good if you're singing, but pretentious if you're not."
  },
  "adopt": {
    "short": "You can adopt an air of nonchalance, a fake British accent, or even a stray dog. When you adopt something, you consciously select it and accept it as your own.",
    "long": "The word adopt has many different shades of meaning, but most relate to the notion of taking something on and treating it as if it’s your own. You’re probably familiar with what happens if you adopt a child: you take on parental responsibilities and accept the child as if it’s your own. You can adopt other things — such as a plan, a method, or a point of view — in a similar way. For example, when you adopt a particular attitude — such as a respectful attitude — you select that as a way to present yourself and behave as if it is natural."
  },
  "passivity": {
    "short": "Passivity is allowing others to do things to you without complaining or pushing back. The baby-sitter's passivity led her charges to walk all over her. They stayed up all night and tied her to the chair, and all she said was, \"Please stop misbehaving.\"",
    "long": "You'd use the noun passivity to refer to the state of being passive — passivity applies to someone who accepts the actions or opinions of others without speaking up. Passivity can help you from getting into a fight but that same passivity can mean you might also get a black eye."
  },
  "clarify": {
    "short": "Clarify means to clear up confusion and make it all understandable. In a heart-breaking text, she clarified that she never ever wanted to see him again. It also means to remove impurities in a liquid; you clarify butter by gently heating it.",
    "long": "Clarify and clear are related, of course, and clear means you can see right through it.  If you clarify your intention or your meaning, others will understand it clearly. If you aren't clear at the outset, you might find the need to clarify what you want later."
  },
  "qui vive": {
    "short": "When you're on the qui vive, you're especially vigilant, carefully keeping watch. Your dog might believe it's her responsibility to be on the qui vive all day, barking at every little noise she hears.",
    "long": "You'll almost always find this term in the phrase \"on the qui vive.\" It comes from the question French guards and sentries would commonly ask visitors to a castle or fort: \"Qui voulez-vous qui vive?\" Literally, this means \"Whom do you wish to live?\" — in other words, \"Whose side are you on?\" Today, being on the qui vive means that you're on the alert, like a sentry, watchman, or guard dog."
  },
  "grapple": {
    "short": "When you wrestle with something — literally or figuratively — you grapple with it, or try to overcome it.",
    "long": "If you trace the word grapple back to its French roots, you’ll discover that the word originally referred to \"a grape hook,\" a pronged tool used to harvest grapes. If you think about how awkward it would be to harvest grapes, with the individual grapes ready to scatter everywhere, it makes sense that grapple eventually evolved to include a verb form used to describe struggling with something unruly. You might grapple with a budget shortfall, grapple for answers, grapple with a wrestling opponent, or grapple with a new technology."
  },
  "breach": {
    "short": "A breach is a violation of a law, duty, or promise. If you'd contracted to mow your neighbor's lawn and don't do it, he can sue you for breach of contract. Or he can mow the lawn himself.",
    "long": "Breach traces back to the Old English verb: brecan, \"to break,\" which is what breach really means — \"a breaking of something.\" Breach of contract is a legal way of saying you broke a promise. If your great aunt Edna is a stickler for propriety, she may be horrified when you eat your meat with the salad fork, considering it a breach of good manners."
  },
  "anthropology": {
    "short": "Anthropology is the scientific study of the origins of humans, how we have changed over the years, and how we relate to each other, both within our own culture and with people from other cultures.",
    "long": "Anthrōpos is the Greek word for “human being,” and the suffix -logy means “the study of.”  The study of human beings, that’s anthropology. Indigenous tribes in Australia, Brazilian coffee farmers, political activists in Iran, a second grade class in Missoula, Montana; these are all groups of people you might study if you were into anthropology. Every culture has its own particular rituals, behaviors, and lifestyles, and people in the field of anthropology document the many varieties of human experience."
  },
  "extemporize": {
    "short": "To extemporize is to improvise, especially without preparation. When you  extemporize, you’re making it up as you go along.",
    "long": "In some situations, you’re prepared and know exactly what you’re going to do. In others, you have to extemporize. A stand-up comedian who makes up jokes on the spot is extemporizing. If a football play breaks down, the quarterback has to scramble and extemporize by coming up with a new play. A public speaker who throws away notes and takes questions is extemporizing. Jazz musicians often extemporize. When you extemporize, even you’re not sure what you might end up doing."
  },
  "murky": {
    "short": "Something that's murky is dim, gloomy or hard to see through clearly. Think of the dark fog around a haunted house or the cloudy, muddy water in a swamp.",
    "long": "Rarely used before the 17th century, this adjective came about by adding a \"y\" to the word murk. Murk itself evolved from myrkr, a Norse word for \"darkness.” Things that are murky are unclear; that goes for murky, sediment-filled lakes, shady business deals, and arguments that don't seem to make any sense."
  },
  "alacrity": {
    "short": "Someone with alacrity shows cheerful willingness and eager behavior, like a kid whose mother has told him he can buy anything in a candy store.",
    "long": "While the noun alacrity normally refers to someone's peppy behavior, it can also describe a certain mood or tempo of a musical composition, indicating how the music should be played. Alacrity comes from the Latin alacritas, and the Italian musical term allegro is a near relation."

  "incisiveness": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "intricate": {
    "short": "Intricate things are complex and have many elements: they're not simple. Think of the intricate wiring of a computer's motherboard, or the intricate plot of a movie that you have a hard time following.",
    "long": "Anything intricate is complicated. Chess is a very intricate game that you could study your entire life and still not know everything about. On the other hand, a game like Connect Four is not very intricate. The more details and parts something has, the more intricate it is. A two-part plan isn't very intricate. A 2000-step plan is intricate; it's harder to wrap your head around."
  },
  "dwarf": {
    "short": "An unusually short, small person is sometimes called a dwarf. There are many different genetic medical conditions that can cause a person to be classified as a little person or a dwarf.",
    "long": "Some people are offended by dwarf, preferring to be called \"little people,\" \"LP,\" or \"people of short stature.\" The general condition that leads to delayed growth is called \"dwarfism.\" The noun dwarf is also used for an unusually small animal or plant, or as a verb meaning \"make something seem very small,\" as when a new apartment building dwarfs the surrounding houses. The Old English root dweorg referred to a tiny creature from German mythology."
  },
  "aberrant": {
    "short": "Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior.",
    "long": "For conduct that departs from the norm, aberrant is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root aberrare means \"to go astray,\" from the prefix ab- \"off, away\" plus errare \"to wander.\"  Other descendants of errare in English, like error and errant, have that double -r- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected."
  },
  "laconic": {
    "short": "Laconic is an adjective that describes a style of speaking or writing that uses only a few words, often to express complex thoughts and ideas.  A more laconic way to write that last sentence might be this: laconic means brief.",
    "long": "There’s a friend of yours who doesn’t talk very much, and when he does, he says maybe three words and then becomes quiet again.  You could describe that friend as laconic.  The word comes from Laconia, a region in ancient Greece where the local Spartan rulers gave very short speeches.  Being laconic can be bad when it sounds rude to be so brief, but it can be good if you’re in a rush to get somewhere."
  },
  "machination": {
    "short": "When a James Bond villain comes up with a plan to destroy the world, he doesn’t use a simple plan. No, he uses a machination — a complex plot that relies on numerous elements coming together to work.",
    "long": "Not surprisingly, machination derives from the Medieval French machina, meaning \"machine.\" And, like many a machine, a machination is subject to going wrong, often comically (see James Bond movies). Politicians love a good machination, and their machinations are frequently exposed in the press as scandals."
  },
  "religion": {
    "short": "Religion has two related meanings: it’s the belief that one or more divine beings are responsible for the fate of all human life, and it’s also an organization where people of a specific religion can express their beliefs.",
    "long": "Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam: these are examples of religions, and millions around the world follow the principles defined by their chosen faith.  The Latin root religio means “to bind,” and religion binds people together not just by their practices, but also by their ideas.  Most religions have their own story about the creation of the universe, and each has a different explanation for the meaning of life, which is a source of comfort for a religion’s followers."
  },
  "meditate": {
    "short": "When you meditate, you silently calm or focus your mind for relaxation or spiritual reasons. People who meditate regularly can put a stop to racing thoughts, making them less distracted.",
    "long": "When you meditate, you focus on your breathing while sitting calmly. Some people mediate to reduce stress, while others see it as part of their spiritual practice. Meditate can also be used to describe any deep thinking you do, like when you meditate on what to say to a friend who is feeling sad lately. The Latin word for \"ponder,\" meditari, is the root of meditate."
  },
  "metamorphosis": {
    "short": "In Kafka's novel entitled Metamorphosis, a man wakes up to find he has turned into a cockroach. That kind of complete and startling change pretty much sums up the word.",
    "long": "When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, it goes through a metamorphosis. An idea can undergo metamorphosis, or metamorphosize, too as can feelings. After you spend a full summer with your grandmother, your feelings about the woman may undergo a complete metamorphosis. While you were once afraid of the old woman, you now love her dearly."
  },
  "demarcate": {
    "short": "To demarcate is to set or draw a boundary, like that of a country. It can also mean to separate clearly in other ways.",
    "long": "When you demarcate, you’re creating a boundary. Election officials who create or change boundaries between districts are demarcating. Demarcating usually starts with making lines on a map, but those lines have power in the world, as they change the size of a district, state, country, or other place. The word can be used more broadly for creating other types of separation. At work, a boss could demarcate which employees are responsible for which work, which is another kind of separation."

  "sediment": {
    "short": "Sediment is the accumulation of sand and dirt that settles in the bottom of lakes. Sediment is also what you get in the bottom of a glass of iced tea when the sugar doesn’t all dissolve.",
    "long": "The noun sediment comes from the Latin word sedere, meaning “to settle,” or “sit.” Sediment is the little bits of solids that sink to the bottom of a container of liquid, whether that container is a body of water or a holding tank at a sewage treatment plant. Millions of years ago, lakes dried up and glaciers compressed their sediment. In this sedimentary rock, fossils are found, giving us clues about prehistoric life."
  },
  "extensive": {
    "short": "When something is far-reaching or expansive it is extensive.  When your friend knows every single place and time that his favorite band has played any given song, he has extensive knowledge of that band.",
    "long": "Use the adjective extensive for something that goes on and on and on.  It works for anything that covers a lot of territory either in physical space, as in \"the gardens at the palace are extensive,\" or conceptually, as in \"her knowledge of the mortgage-backed securities market is extensive.\"  If you are a farmer, you would also use extensive to mean that you are able to work a lot of land without too much effort or manual labor."
  },
  "uncouth": {
    "short": "When you're at a fancy dinner party, if you burp after you eat, use your fingers to spread butter on your bread, and hang spoons from your nose, people will probably say you are uncouth, meaning vulgar and ill-mannered.",
    "long": "The adjective uncouth comes from Old English and it meant \"unfamiliar or not well known.\" As the meaning developed, the word came to mean \"rude, vulgar, or lacking refinement.\" Interestingly, the word uncouth came first and its antonym, couth, was developed to describe someone who is cultured, polished, and sophisticated. Although couth gets an entry in the dictionary, you will still hear the word uncouth used far more often."
  },
  "savor": {
    "short": "Whether it’s a feeling of joy or a piece of pecan pie — when you savor something, you enjoy it to the fullest.",
    "long": "When you savor something, you enjoy it so much that you want to make it last forever. With that in mind, savor carries a connotation of doing something slowly. If you savor that flourless chocolate tart, then you eat it slowly, bit by bit, deliberately picking every last crumb off the plate. The word is often applied to eating, but you can savor any pleasurable experience, whether it’s the winning touchdown or your moment in the spotlight."
  },
  "seething": {
    "short": "Seething describes anger you can barely contain. If you are seething and something sets you off, you just might explode into a rage.",
    "long": "Someone who's seething with anger is furious but keeping it a secret. Maybe someone insulted you in front of others and you want to let it go — on the inside, though, you might be seething. Or during the big game, an opponent's harsh words can have you seething, but you want to stay focused on scoring points. Seething sometimes describes something that's boiling over, like a seething pot of soup, and this is also the root of the word."
  },
  "preamble": {
    "short": "A preamble is a brief introduction to a speech, like the Preamble to the Constitution that starts out \"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union...do ordain and establish this Constitution.\"",
    "long": "Preamble comes from the Latin praeambulus which means \"walking before.\" And that's what a preamble does — it \"walks\" before a speech, often explaining what's coming. It's like the White Rabbit introducing the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland.  Since it goes before a speech, think of it as a pre-ramble.  A preamble is usually used for formal documents; you wouldn't include one in a text to your best friend."
  },
  "dissipate": {
    "short": "To dissipate is to disperse or fade away — as a bad smell will dissipate (usually) if you wait long enough.",
    "long": "Dissipate can also mean “spend or use wastefully.” If you win the lottery, you might suddenly find yourself with a group of new friends encouraging you to dissipate your money (on them). Note that dissipate can be used with or without an object: \"Once you dissipate your wealth, your new group of friends will dissipate without a trace.\""
  },
  "vibrate": {
    "short": "When you feel something vibrate, it trembles and shakes. A mild earthquake, for example, might make your chandelier vibrate.",
    "long": "A hummingbird's wings vibrate, and so does an electric toothbrush. That extremely rapid back-and-forth movement is what happens when something vibrates. Something can also vibrate in a more musical, resonant way — the sound of an organ might vibrate through a church, for example. The root is the Latin word vibratus, which means \"move quickly to and fro or shake.\""
  },
  "opaque": {
    "short": "Use the adjective opaque either for something that doesn't allow light to pass through (like a heavy curtain) or for something difficult to understand (like bureaucratic gobbledygook).",
    "long": "Opaque is from a Latin word meaning \"dark,\" and that was its original sense in English, but it now means literally \"not transparent\" or metaphorically \"hard to understand; unclear\": \"Some of his sentences are really opaque.\" It used to be spelled opake, which made the pronunciation clearer, but we then borrowed the more opaque French spelling. Come to think of it, English spelling is often pretty opaque, which makes it hard for learners of the language to master."
  },
  "regale": {
    "short": "You may have heard it said that the fastest way to a person’s heart is through his stomach. So, if you need to please or impress someone, regale them — that is, treat them to lavish food and drink.",
    "long": "While food is a reliable way to regale someone, regale can also involve providing forms of entertainment such as music or storytelling. Regale is akin to the word gala, meaning “a festive party,” and gallant, which can mean “spirited and adventurous” (though gallant can also mean “noble and brave”). If you regale someone with a gala attended by partygoers who are gallant, in either sense of the word, everyone should have a pretty good time."
  },
  "rehash": {
    "short": "When you rehash something, you use it again without altering or changing it much. Your favorite band's new album will be a disappointment if they just rehash all their old hits.",
    "long": "Sometimes movie sequels are great films in their own right, but often they simply rehash the storyline, characters, and jokes from the original. You can call a movie like this a rehash. Another way to rehash is to go over something again, rethinking or reconsidering it: \"She just wants to rehash that argument, trying to figure out why her friend got so angry.\""
  },
  "unwittingly": {
    "short": "When you do something unwittingly, you don't do it on purpose. It's completely accidental or unintentional, like when you unwittingly offended the Queen by not curtseying properly.",
    "long": "If you know exactly what you're doing, you're not doing it unwittingly; you're doing it intentionally.  This adverb comes from unwitting and its Old English root unwitende, \"ignorant.\" Wit means \"knowledge,\" so if you do something unwittingly, you act without knowledge. If you post too much personal information online, you might unwittingly set yourself up to have your identity stolen."
  },
  "aerie": {
    "short": "An aerie is the nest of a large bird of prey somewhere high up, such as the branch of a tree or a clifftop.",
    "long": "Don't confuse aerie with airy, meaning spacious and well ventilated (though it's a safe bet that given their location most aeries are exactly that). The word also has the meaning of a human residence that's perched high up — particularly an artist's garret, for example, in the eaves of a building."
  },
  "spite": {
    "short": "When your sister told you that you looked terrible in your new tube top, she may have been saying it out of spite, or in a deliberately mean or offensive way.",
    "long": "The noun spite means \"a desire to offend.\" The word spite can also take the form of a verb, when it's used like this: \"He only became a vegetarian to spite his cattle rancher father.\" Either way, spite implies a grudge, a desire to offend or hurt the feelings of someone by actions or words."
  },
  "pedal": {
    "short": "Anything you push with your feet to control a machine, vehicle, or instrument is a pedal. When you use a sewing machine, you push the pedal with your foot to make the needle move up and down.",
    "long": "When you see the letters ped, something related to the foot might just be afoot. Pedestrians walk around by foot, and a pedicure is when your tootsies get the spa treatment. Those letters don’t always relate to feet, but it does with pedal, the noun or verb. The controls on the floor of your car are pedals, and if you put the pedal to the metal, it means you press as hard as you can on the gas pedal. Woohoo!"
  },
  "skeptical": {
    "short": "If a friend told you that her family was perfect and they never had any problems, would you believe her? If not, you may be skeptical. Skeptical people look at the world with a certain amount of doubt.",
    "long": "This word comes from ancient Greece, where a philosopher named Pyrrho taught his followers that we can never really understand the true nature of things, only how they appear to us. (So basically, we should stop searching for the meaning of life and just relax.) In Pyrrho's view, the true sage was someone who realized that it was impossible to be certain about anything. His followers were called Skeptikoi, or Skeptics; the Greek word skeptikos means “given to asking questions.”"
  },
  "elusive": {
    "short": "Things that are elusive are hard to find, pin down, or remember. They slip right out of your grasp.",
    "long": "Ever try to catch a mouse? It's not easy, because mice are quick and elusive — they're tough to catch. Rabbits are speedy, so they're elusive too. Also, things that are tough to understand or describe are elusive — like the concepts of love and beauty. If you had an idea and then forgot it, the idea is elusive: it slipped away. Anything you can't get hold of, with your hands or with your brain, is elusive."
  },
  "visceral": {
    "short": "When something's visceral, you feel it in your guts. A visceral feeling is intuitive — there might not be a rational explanation, but you feel that you know what's best, like your visceral reaction against egg salad.",
    "long": "Your hatred of mice may not be rational, but it is visceral, and every time you see one, you feel like you're going to faint. And when you had to decide whether you were going to stay in Florida or move to Texas, even though you had a good job in Orlando you had a visceral feeling that Texas would be the right choice . . . and it turned out you were meant to be a rancher! Visceral can also mean “relating to the viscera,” with viscera being your organs."
  },
  "incidence": {
    "short": "Incidence means the frequency with which something bad occurs. You’ll hear of “incidences of cancer” or “incidences of war.\" You hope the incidence is decreasing, not increasing.",
    "long": "You might confuse incidence and incident. They sound similar, but incident refers only to something that happened, not to the frequency with which it happens. After a car accident, the police file an incident report, which is a fancy way of saying they write down what happened. Looking at these reports grouped together can show you if the incidence of accidents at specific intersections in town is on the rise."
  },
  "elated": {
    "short": "If you're elated you aren't just happy — you're over the moon, absolutely excited, and bursting with pride. Like the way you feel after winning a scholarship to your first-choice college or mastering a back handspring.",
    "long": "You might be elated to hear you got that dream job, and your whole family might be elated when your favorite baseball team wins the World Series. Feeling elated is all about being so extremely proud and overjoyed, and usually happens as a result of an accomplishment. So if you've just achieved something big, feel free to be elated — and enjoy your time on cloud nine."
  },
  "dispensable": {
    "short": "Something that's dispensable isn't necessary — you don't really need it. Your vintage typewriter is cool, but it's also dispensable, since you can type and print with your laptop.",
    "long": "If robots are invented to do most of the jobs in the world, human workers will become dispensable, or unneeded. Likewise, many home chefs might insist that if you have a really good, sharp knife, other tools like peelers and choppers and food processors are completely dispensable. The earliest definition of this word was \"subject to dispensation,\" from the Latin dispensare, \"disburse or distribute,\" although by the 1640s dispensable meant \"that which can be done without.\""
  },
  "afflict": {
    "short": "To afflict is to cause suffering, pain, or misery. It’s often associated with medical conditions. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is most likely to afflict someone who spends many hours every day typing on our computers.",
    "long": "We get afflict from the Latin word affligere, meaning “to strike down,” which is an old fashioned way of saying to get sick, or to have a condition of some kind. You could argue that chronic indecision was the main problem to afflict Hamlet, or that saying \"um,\" \"like,\" and \"you know\" are speech tics that afflict teens."
  },
  "innate": {
    "short": "If a characteristic or ability is already present in a person or animal when they are born, it is innate. People have the innate ability to speak whereas animals do not.",
    "long": "Innate can also be used figuratively for something that comes from the mind rather than from external sources. Do you know someone with an innate sense of style? Some kids seem to have an innate sense of fairness where others seem to be natural bullies. In some contexts, innate means inherent. There is an innate sadness in certain types of ceremonies."

  "precious": {
    "short": "To call something precious is to describe it as highly valued. Think of a gemstone when you call your baby sister precious.",
    "long": "Diamonds, emeralds and rubies are all precious stones and gold and silver are precious metals. If it is something valuable and treasured, it can be called precious too. Fresh water is a precious resource especially in desert countries. Many precious books and painting have been destroyed through fire and war. On a more personal note, guard your memories as they will always be precious to you."
  },
  "import": {
    "short": "Imports are the products shipped into our country from other places. We import Japanese autos and export our pop music to Tokyo. Import also means to signify something. Is it of import to our economic security to have so many Japanese imports on our roads?",
    "long": "The origins of the word import are literally \"to bring into port.\" The ratio of imports to exports is a big indicator of the health of a nation's economy. The word import can also refer to attitudes or behaviors that come as part of the culture of a place. \"New York media is dominated by British journalists who have imported the snarky style of gossip reporting famous in London.\""
  },
  "morph": {
    "short": "To morph is to change from one shape to another. A cute bunny, for example, might morph into a killer dragon in a fairy tale or an animated film.",
    "long": "Morph comes from the word metamorphosis, which is a Greek word meaning \"a transforming.\" As a verb, it has only been around since the 1980s, when computers allowed animators to make things change shape in an apparently seamlessly way. With the right skills, you can morph a toaster into a highly intelligent robot that helps fight crime, offers dating advice to the protagonist of the film, and still makes an excellent piece of toast."
  },
  "lope": {
    "short": "Some words are fun to say: lope is one of them. It's also fun to think about, as it means to move with a casual, striding gait. Imagine a horse cantering along with an easy lope. A pleasant image indeed.",
    "long": "Before 1825, the meaning of lope was in the line of a leap or springy jump. This comes from the Old Norse word hlaupa, which sounds like its English meaning, \"to leap.\" This is similar to the Old Dutch lopen, \"to run,\" and the Old English hlēapan, \"leap,\" as well as the Scots loup, all related to the modern meaning: a long, striding gait with a little bounce to it."
  },
  "transit": {
    "short": "Transit means “journey,” and saying you’re \"in transit\" means you’re on your way somewhere. Before we had cell phones, one of the upsides of being in transit was that no one could get in touch with you.",
    "long": "Transit may be familiar to you from the phrase mass transit. While it sometimes seems like “mass transit” is synonymous with “unreliable, crowded and inefficient,” the phrase just means \"public transportation.\" The first instance of transit being used in this sense was in the 19th century, and people have been complaining ever since. Transit is related to the word transition, which refers to a change from one state or condition to another."
  },
  "exuberant": {
    "short": "Are you feeling really happy and enthusiastic about something? Describe yourself with the adjective exuberant!",
    "long": "Exuberant can be traced back to the same Indo-European root that has brought the word udder. If you picture the plentiful amount of milk a cow can give, it is easy to remember that exuberant always describes something that is abundant or plentiful like exuberant foliage. Abundance also comes into play in its primary use today to mean \"very enthusiastic, full of energy or overjoyed.\" When the bell rings on the last day of school, you will be exuberant."
  },
  "inimical": {
    "short": "Censorship is inimical to freedom. So, most teenagers would argue, are curfews. To be inimical is to be harmful, antagonistic, or opposed to something.",
    "long": "Inimical comes from the Latin word inimicus, meaning \"enemy.\" It suggests acting like someone's enemy — being adverse, damaging, or downright hostile. It can refer to anything from emotions and actions to public policy. The U.S. government might declare that another nation's actions are inimical to national security — and your mom might declare that eating a dozen doughnuts every morning is inimical to your health. Be careful not to mix up inimical with inimitable, which means too good to be copied."
  },
  "submissive": {
    "short": "When animals live in packs, one animal is usually the dominant leader, while the others fall into more submissive roles. To be submissive is to obey or yield to someone else.",
    "long": "When you are submissive, you submit to someone else's will, which literally, you put your own desires lower than theirs. You can see this in the Latin root of submit, submittere, which is formed by sub- \"under\" + mittere \"send, put.\""
  },
  "conjure": {
    "short": "If your mom can magically conjure up the most delicious meals from the most random ingredients in the kitchen, she might just be the best cook in the neighborhood.",
    "long": "Sometimes the mere sight or smell of something can conjure or stir up long lost memories, magically transporting you back to another place and time. But in the early 13th century, conjure was a bit more sinister — it meant using a spell to capture a demon to do one's bidding. In our modern day, conjure still carries the meaning of summoning a spirit, but it more regularly means to summon an idea or bring something into existence."
  },
  "seraphic": {
    "short": "Something that's seraphic resembles an angel. A seraphic smile is sweet and angelic.",
    "long": "The adjective seraphic means \"like a seraph,\" or similar to a high-ranking angel. People with gentle, innocent faces are often said to be seraphic, and any kind of dreamy music or art can be described the same way. The word dates from the 17th century, from the Church Latin seraphicus, originally from the Hebrew seraphim, which is thought to mean \"the burning one,\" as seraphs were traditionally \"flaming\" angels."
  },
  "invoke": {
    "short": "To invoke is to call up something such as a law, a higher power, or even a ghost. In court, you might invoke the Fifth Amendment (the right not to say something that will make you look bad) if you don't want to talk.",
    "long": "You can invoke all kinds of people or ideas, alive or dead: \"She invokes the spirit of good writing when she proofreads her work.\" In a time of need, you might invoke a higher power. You could invoke Martin Luther King when talking about equal rights. You might even invoke the spirit of your dead cat at a séance. Just make sure you don't evoke (to bring on a strong emotional reaction) your dead cat; that would just be weird."
  },
  "discordant": {
    "short": "If you believe that movies should entertain, but your friend insists that movies should inspire, then the two of you hold discordant views on the purpose of movies. That means your opinions are in conflict.",
    "long": "You can see the word discord in discordant. Discord is tension felt between people who strongly disagree about something. So discordant describes experiencing discord, a lack of harmony. A discordant conversation at your dinner table may make some people upset — they want everyone to get along. Discordant can also describe harsh and unpleasant sounds, like the blaring horns in city traffic."

    "long": "When you transplant your favorite rose bush, you carefully dig it up and re-plant it in another spot in the yard, maybe one that gets more sunlight. You can also use the word as a noun to describe the act of doing such a thing: \"The liver transplant was a success.\" The word's origin is simple: the Latin trans, or \"across,\" plus plantare, which means \"to plant.\""

  "heredity": {

    "long": "First used in the 1530s, the noun heredity comes from the Latin word hereditatem, meaning \"condition of being an heir.\" It can refer to inheriting characteristics from your parents, or it can refer more broadly to the passing on of genetic factors from one generation to the next. Heredity will determine a person's hair color and height. And due to heredity, some people are more susceptible to diseases and disorders like cancer, alcoholism, and depression."

    "long": "Some diaries have a pretty cover and a tiny lock with a key, for keeping the contents safe from prying eyes. You can also call such a book a \"journal,\" although traditionally a diary is written in each day, while a journal might have less frequent entries. The word diary comes from the Latin word diarium, \"daily allowance,\" with its root of dies, or \"day.\""
  },
  "accursed": {

    "long": "An accursed house might be haunted by a spirit or under an evil spell, or you might describe it as accursed if unexplained things happen in it. You can also use the adjective simply to describe something you're angry about: \"This accursed town! I can't wait to move to California!\" In the 13th century, the word was acursede, \"lying under a curse,\" from the now-obsolete acursen, \"pronounce a curse upon.\""

    "long": "When capitalized, Orthodox is the name of the Eastern Church, originally distinguished by its doctrinal differences from the other divisions of the Christian Church. Orthodox is also the name of the branch of Judaism that strictly follows traditional beliefs and customs, derived from orthodox in the earlier meaning of \"strictly observant.\""

  "accrue": {
    "short": "To accrue is to accumulate or to keep growing in value or size. If you can accrue enough extra credit to build up your grade, you won't have to take the final exam.",
    "long": "Early forms of the word accrue were used as early as the 15th century with the meaning \"to increase\" or \"to grow.\" Many modern uses for accrue involve money or finances, as when you accrue, or earn, interest on a bank account. You can accrue debt too, as interest grows on top of money owed until you pay it back. It's possible to accrue benefits over the time you work somewhere, or you can accrue demerits while you're misbehaving somewhere."
  },
  "instigate": {
    "short": "When you instigate something, you start it, but the word carries conflict with it. If you are suspended for wearing a political t-shirt, the incident might instigate days of protest by students and faculty.",
    "long": "Instigate comes from the Latin word instigare \"to incite.\" People who are instigators often begin trouble but then back off and let others break the rules. If you instigate a food fight in the cafeteria, you might throw the first spoonful of mashed potatoes, but then you stop and let all the other students carry on the chaos. When something is instigated, the outcome tends to be unknown. The plan you instigate might not lead to the desired result."
  },
  "fauna": {
    "short": "When you go on a nature walk in a school setting, your teacher might tell you to observe the flora and fauna in the woods. Flora is plant life; fauna refers to animals.",
    "long": "Fauna derives from the name of a Roman goddess, but the handiest way to remember the difference between flora and fauna is that flora sounds like flowers, which are part of the plant world; fauna, however, sounds like \"fawn,\" and fawns are part of the animal kingdom."
  },
  "calumny": {
    "short": "Use the noun calumny to characterize verbal attacks that are meant to destroy reputations or friendships. You've probably seen political ads during election time that rely on calumny to move voters.",
    "long": "Calumny comes from the Latin word calvi, meaning \"to trick, deceive,\" which is why it can also describe falsely accusing someone or quoting them out of context with the intent to do them harm. Some political candidates use this tactic against opponents in the hope that voters will be tricked into thinking that the accusations are true."
  },
  "fictitious": {
    "short": "Fictitious means made up, or imaginary. No matter how real Scarlett O'Hara might seem in \"Gone With the Wind,\" she's a fictitious character invented by author Margaret Mitchell.",
    "long": "When you look at the word fictitious, you'll probably notice that it bears a striking resemblance to fiction — which is an imaginary story about people and events that are made up for the purpose of entertaining readers. Fictitious can also be used to mean \"trick or deceive.\" A thief assumes a fictitious name to hide his real identity and evade capture."
  },
  "coerce": {
    "short": "You can bring a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. You can coerce — or pressure — someone to attend your office holiday party, but you can't make him have fun.",
    "long": "If you're at a point where you feel like you need to coerce someone into doing something, it might be more civilized to just give up. To coerce is to manipulate, use aggressive arguments, pressure unfairly, or threaten — really, this isn't very civilized behavior, is it? Handy synonyms for this verb include force and pressure. In a gangster film, you might hear a character say he \"put the squeeze\" on someone — another way of saying he coerced them."
  },
  "mortgage": {
    "short": "A mortgage is a loan in which the lender may use your property as payment if you don't pay back the loan. Offer your friend a mortgage for the $20 he wants...with his bike as security.",
    "long": "Most people obtain a mortgage when they buy a house. The bank extends the loan because of the guarantee that the house will be the bank’s to sell if the debt isn’t repaid. When you make this deal, you have mortgaged your house — the word mortgage can be used as a noun or a verb."
  },
  "comprehend": {
    "short": "To comprehend something is to understand it, like when you have to read a difficult passage more than once in order to comprehend it.",
    "long": "When you comprehend something, you grasp its meaning.  Comprehend is a verb that originates from the Latin word comprehendere, which means “catch or seize.”  When an idea is clear to you and you understand it completely, you comprehend it, like doing extra problems to make sure you comprehend a difficult algebra rule, or finding it hard to comprehend why someone would paint his house neon yellow."

  "generator": {
    "short": "If your neighborhood loses power, it’s good to have your own generator so you can keep the lights on. A generator is machine that produces power.",
    "long": "Generator can also mean someone who creates something. If you come up with lots of ideas, you are an idea generator. Not so helpful during a blackout unless you had the idea to get a portable generator. This kind of generator makes electricity out of some other type of power (like wind power) or fuel (like propane or gas). In Latin, generator means \"begetter or producer,\" from generare, \"to bring forth.\""

  "incandescent": {
    "short": "When heated, coals become incandescent, which means that they glow red-hot. You could also describe a brilliant and moving novel as incandescent.",
    "long": "Incandescent, like the word candle, has its origins in the Latin word candere meaning \"to glow or shine.\" Combined with the suffix in meaning \"within,\" its meaning can be easily pulled from the combination of its root words: \"to glow or shine from within.\" Fire crackers are incandescent because they give off brilliant lights when heated, but look up at a blazing fireworks display, and you'll find it's quite moving, or incandescent with intensity and brilliance."
  },
  "deterioration": {
    "short": "If something is in a state of deterioration, it's getting worse. A crumbling old house with a caved-in roof and foot-tall weeds growing through the deck is going through deterioration.",
    "long": "Deterioration implies that things are falling apart: something once in good condition is now weakened, worn out, or otherwise in decline. Things often undergo deterioration because of neglect. Time also has a lot to do with deterioration. Museum curators are always worried about stopping the deterioration of their prized antiquities, like the ancient Egyptian mummies that should not be exposed to air."
  },
  "dubious": {
    "short": "Choose the adjective dubious for something you have doubts about or you suspect is not true. That bridge you just \"bought\" might be of dubious value.",
    "long": "Dubious stems from Latin dubiosus, \"doubtful\" or \"uncertain,\" and contains the Latin root duo in this case meaning \"of two minds.\" This is apparent in that dubious generally describes something that appears one way but is truly another. A dubious claim is probably not true, whereas a dubious website or character is of questionable quality. Dubious can also be synonymous with doubtful, as in \"she was dubious about the idea.\""
  },
  "attuned": {
    "short": "When you attune to something, you adjust to it and become aware of the way it works. A new parent has to attune to a baby's schedule and personality.",
    "long": "Preschool teachers need to attune to their students' various needs and interests, and when you visit a foreign country it's important to attune to the unfamiliar culture, so that you're both comfortable and respectful. The verb attune is almost always followed by \"to,\" and it often shows up in the form of \"be attuned to.\" Attune comes from tune, \"bring into a state of proper pitch.\""
  },
  "redeem": {
    "short": "If you redeem yourself, you make up for wrongs by doing something that makes you seem good again, like when after being irritable and snappy with your grandmother, you redeem yourself by bringing her flowers and apologizing.",
    "long": "Redeem comes from the French rédimer, which means \"to deliver,\" and which in turn comes from the Latin for \"buy back.\" In Christianity you can be redeemed by renouncing your sins. Classic heroes fail and then redeem themselves with valiant acts. But redeem doesn't have to be religious or moral. When you turn in a glass bottle for recycling, you redeem it, just as you redeem your coupon for 20% off your next hamburger."
  },
  "intimidate": {
    "short": "You can see \"timid\" in the middle of intimidate, and to be timid is to be frightened or to pull back from something. When you intimidate, you frighten or make someone afraid. A pet rat might intimidate your sister's friends, keeping them out of your fort.",
    "long": "\"To frighten\" or \"make fearful\" is at the root of the verb intimidate. An animal might intimidate a smaller animal by bearing its teeth, and a person can intimidate another by threatening to do something harmful. You can be intimidated with mental or emotional bullying, as well as with something physical: \"they were all good spellers, but some of them knew how to intimidate the competition into thinking they didn't have a chance at winning the spelling bee.\""
  },
  "quixotically": {
    "short": "When you do something quixotically, you act in an unrealistically hopeful way. Despite the impossibility of your plan, you quixotically continue trying to build a treehouse for your dog, complete with running water and electricity.",
    "long": "The adverb quixotically applies best to deeply impractical actions taken on in a spirit of romantic idealism. An activist who protests a logging company's clearcutting by remaining for weeks chained to the last redwood tree is acting quixotically, with noble but unattainable goals. The word comes from the impossibly idealistic hero of Cervantes's 1605 novel Don Quixote de la Mancha."
  },
  "cajole": {
    "short": "To cajole someone is to persuade them by using insincere compliments or promises. If you say \"Please, pretty-please, I'll be your best friend,\" when asking for a stick of gum, you are cajoling the gum holder.",
    "long": "The origin of this word is probably a blend of two French words meaning \"to chatter like a jaybird\" and \"to lure into a cage.\" When you cajole that guy into lending you some money, picture him as the bird going into the cage. In fact, the word cajole may be associated with another French word meaning \"to put in jail.\""
  },
  "illiberal": {
    "short": "Someone who's illiberal is close-minded and intolerant. Your illiberal grandfather might constantly complain about \"kids today with their long hair and tattoos.\"",
    "long": "An illiberal person tends to have old-fashioned values and opinions and isn't usually interested in considering other perspectives. It's illiberal to dismiss unfamiliar religious beliefs — or the lack of any religious belief — as just plain wrong. The original, 1500s meaning of illiberal was \"ungentlemanly,\" from the Latin word illiberalis, \"ungenerous, mean, or unworthy of a freeman.\" The \"narrow-minded\" sense of the word is from the mid-1600s."
  },
  "abjure": {
    "short": "Abjure means to swear off, and it applies to something you once believed. You can abjure a religious faith, you can abjure your love of another person, and you can abjure the practice of using excessive force in interrogation.",
    "long": "Abjure is a more dramatic way to declare your rejection of something you once felt or believed. When you see its Latin roots, it makes sense: from ab- (meaning \"away\") and jurare (\"to swear\"). When you abjure something, you swear it away and dissociate yourself with it. You might abjure the field of astrology after receiving a bad fortune, or you might abjure marriage after a bitter divorce."
  },
  "reverent": {
    "short": "When you have great awe and respect for someone or something, and you show it by respectfully worshiping that person, thing, deity, or musical group, you are being reverent.",
    "long": "Originally, the word reverent was used only in religious contexts, but now it works when people are just acting like they’re in a religious setting (even if the object of their worship is a sports star or political pundit). People are occasionally reverent in regard to antique cars, supermodels, spelling bee champions and giant TV screens.  Reverent is related to the verb revere, which is also about having or showing respect for someone or something."
  },
  "subscribe": {
    "short": "If you subscribe to something, you sign up to receive it regularly. If you subscribe to the New York Times, it's delivered to your door every morning or you get online access.",
    "long": "When you subscribe to a belief, you adopt it as your own. You might subscribe to the notion that children should be seen and not heard, or you might wholeheartedly subscribe to your town's proposal to save the wetlands. A less common use of subscribe is to sign your name on something, reflecting the origin of the word, which comes from the Latin subscribere, \"to write below,\" that is, to sign at the bottom of a document."
  },
  "bask": {
    "short": "To bask in something is to take it in, receive its warmth, or bathe in its goodness. On the first warm day of the spring, you may bask in the sunshine. When you win the Pulitzer, you bask in your own glory.",
    "long": "In Shakespeare’s “As You Like It,” Jaques says: “...As I do live by food, I met a fool; Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,; And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms...” That was most likely the first time bask was used in the way that we most often use it now: to bask is to warm yourself, either literally or figuratively, in the glow of the sun, good fortune, happiness, or a job well done."
  },
  "subtle": {
    "short": "Something that is subtle is not obvious: a professional food taster might be able to perceive subtle differences of flavor that most people don't notice.",
    "long": "Subtle is used for things that are hard to describe because of their complexity or delicacy: a way of thinking, arguing, or creating a work of art.  The word is pronounced like \"suttle\" and it was originally spelled that way when it was borrowed from Old French, but the b got imported to make the word look more like its ultimate source, the Latin adjective subtilis. If you try to pronounce the b, your ignorance of how to say the word properly won't be very subtle!"
  },
  "repress": {
    "short": "Whether you're repressing a feeling, an idea or even a revolution, you're almost always going to be taking advantage of the press in repress. To repress something is to \"press it down\" where it can't be seen, heard or even recognized.",
    "long": "Psychologists often try to help people recover memories that they've repressed so that they can feel free of them once and for all. What makes repress different from press is that repress is almost always used when you're talking about an idea, concept or something intangible. In other words, you repress, say, your emotions. You don't repress olives to get olive oil. However, you can repress someone or some group by intimidating them — like repressing the protesters by sending out cops on horseback."
  },
  "reactant": {
    "short": "A reactant is a substance that changes in a chemical reaction. Vinegar and baking soda are reactants — when you mix them together, they bubble up and make really good lava for a model volcano.",
    "long": "Reactants usually hang around the chemistry lab, but the concept isn't difficult if you think about the word react. When people react, they do something such as laugh at a joke or cry at sad news. In chemistry, reactants are part of something happening too: if two chemicals bond when mixed together, or if one dissolves, they are reactants. Any kind of chemical reaction involves reactants."
  },
  "curb": {
    "short": "The hard thing about learning how to parallel park is trying to get the car close enough to the curb without hitting it. A curb is the edge of the sidewalk beside the road.",
    "long": "When you're using the word curb as a noun, it's the raised edging beside a street. When curb is a verb, it means to restrain or hold back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a badly acted play. Curb comes from the Latin word for \"curve,\" curvus, which describes the shape of a restraining strap on a horse's head — in the fifteenth century, this band was called a curb."
  },
  "configuration": {
    "short": "When you position items into any spatial arrangement, you are creating a configuration, or specific shape. For example, scientists refer to the specific, bonded arrangement of atoms to make a molecule as a configuration.",
    "long": "The root of configuration presents pretty much the current meaning, with the Latin configūrāre meaning \"to mold or shape.\" You can see the word figure in the middle, which presents the idea of a physical form that's being shaped. As an example: the specific configuration, or arrangement, of the genes in your DNA is what makes you the unique individual that you are."
  },
  "elevate": {
    "short": "To elevate is to lift up, either literally or figuratively. One way to elevate your mood is to exercise and elevate your heart rate. But if you exercise too hard and sprain your ankle, you might have to elevate it by propping it on a pillow.",
    "long": "An elevator elevates you: it carries you to a higher floor in a building. Elevate can also mean to raise something to a higher intellectual level, as when an informed speaker elevates the level of debate about an issue. A boss can elevate, or promote, a worker to a better position. For example, a restaurant manager might elevate a superb busboy to the position of waiter. Elevate comes from Latin elevates, which means “to raise” or even \"to lighten.”"
  },
  "tumor": {
    "short": "A tumor is a growth — a mass of tissue — that has no function. Tumors can be harmless (benign) or harmful (malignant), but they are never any fun.",
    "long": "When a bunch of cells form a new growth in or on an animal, and those cells have no purpose, the result is a tumor. The word tumor comes directly from Latin word for “swelling.” Tumors can be big or small, harmless or harmful. Benign tumors are not a cause for concern, but a malignant tumor is serious and could be cancerous. A doctor must test a tumor to see which kind it is."
  },
  "ostensible": {
    "short": "When something is ostensible it appears to be the case but might not be. Your ostensible reason for visiting every bakery in town is that you're looking for a part-time job — but I think you really just want to eat cupcakes.",
    "long": "Just because something is ostensible doesn't necessarily mean that it's not as it appears to be, only that there's a possibility of another reason. Your ostensible reason for calling your crush was to ask about homework; the real reason was that you were hoping they would ask you out. Ostensible derives from the Latin verb ostendere, meaning \"to show or display.\""
  },
  "leitmotif": {
    "short": "If you notice the subject of freedom coming up again and again in a book you're reading for English class, you can impress your teacher by calling it a leitmotif, or a theme that recurs.",
    "long": "The noun leitmotif is most useful for talking about music, and it usually comes up in the context of classical music, whenever a particular phrase or tune is repeated. The word comes from the German Leitmotiv, which literally means \"lead motif,\" or \"guiding motif.\" Though leitmotif makes music experts think of Wagner's operas when they hear it, it's been around at least since Mozart's time."
  },
  "terse": {
    "short": "Terse means brief, or using very few words. If your teacher tells you to make your writing in your essay style terse and to the point, he's saying use as few words as you can and be simple and clear.",
    "long": "A terse reply or command may seem rude or unfriendly—but the word terse itself doesn't mean unfriendly or rude. Synonyms are succinct or concise, though these words have a more positive tone. The adjective terse is from Latin tersus \"clean, neat,\" from tergere \"to rub off, wipe, polish.\" Polished language is neatly concise."
  },
  "mitigate": {
    "short": "Choose the verb mitigate when something lessens the unpleasantness of a situation. You can mitigate your parents' anger by telling them you were late to dinner because you were helping your elderly neighbor.",
    "long": "The somewhat formal verb mitigate comes from the Latin roots mītis, \"soft,\" and agere, \"to do/act,\" which add up to \"to soften.\" It is often used with words that indicate an outcome or something harmful. When you buy car insurance, you are trying to mitigate the risks involved with driving. Sunscreen is used to mitigate the effects of the sun on your skin."
  },
  "colloquial": {
    "short": "Colloquial language is casual and conversational: it's the difference between \"What are you going to do?\" and \"Whatchagonnado?\"",
    "long": "The word colloquial comes from the Latin word colloquium, which means \"speaking together.\" The roots are the prefix com-, which means \"together,\" and the suffix -loqu, which means \"speak.\" Some may think that colloquial language is not good, when in fact it may just not be appropriate for the context. While it is OK to be colloquial and chatty with friends, it is not acceptable to be colloquial in an essay for school or work."
  },
  "cosset": {
    "short": "To cosset is to pamper or spoil. Your mom might cosset her beloved lap dog, feeding him homemade meals and singing him to sleep.",
    "long": "If your parents used to cosset you when you were little, they may have protected you from injury and indulged your every whim. Your temptation might be to cosset small children or elderly relatives, pampering them and shielding them from difficulty. In the 17th century, cosset had the additional sense of \"fondle and caress,\" as you might cuddle a baby or a puppy. Earlier, the word was a noun meaning \"a lamb raised as a pet.\""
  },
  "create": {
    "short": "To create simply means to make or bring into existence. Bakers create cakes, ants create problems at picnics, and you probably created a few imaginary friends when you were little.",
    "long": "Similar to conceive and spawn and the exact opposite of destroy, create is a word that often implies a little bit of imagination. In fact, it takes a lot of creativity to create something spectacular; that is, unless you're a robot, and then your creations occur automatically. Or Mother Nature, where creation just happens naturally: Birds create nests, the tides create waves, and snowstorms create days off from school."
  },
  "dense": {
    "short": "When woods are dense, the trees grow close together. When fog is dense, you can't see through it. And if someone calls you dense, they think nothing can get into your thick skull.",
    "long": "Dense comes from the Latin densus which means thick and cloudy. In general, the word means packed tight and gives the sense that something is difficult to get through. Text can be dense in two different ways: when the words are packed closely together on the page, and when the text is filled with big words and complicated thoughts. Either way, reading dense text is just no fun."
  },
  "aggregate": {
    "short": "To aggregate is to collect many units into one. If you're writing a novel, you might create a character who is an aggregate of five or six real people.",
    "long": "Aggregate comes from the Latin verb aggregare, which means to add to. As a verb it means to collect into a mass or whole. You can also use it as an adjective, as in your aggregate sales for February, March and April. It can also be a noun. The mountain of foam in bubble bath is an aggregate of small bubbles. If you plan to work in economics or business, expect to see the word aggregate quite a lot."
  },
  "bureaucracy": {
    "short": "A bureaucracy is an organization made up of many departments and divisions that are administered by lots of people. If you've ever had to deal with health insurance or financial aid, you're familiar with the dark side of bureaucracy.",
    "long": "Bureaucracy has a bad reputation because it has come to mean an organization or government that is chin-deep in red tape and unnecessary procedures. When dealing with a bureaucracy, expect to fill out lots of forms and wait. Bureaucracies are mocked in the hilarious film \"Brazil,\" where people have mind-numbing jobs they do while sitting at desks. Bureaucracy is an organization administered by people behind desks, or bureaus. Bureaus, get it?"
  },
  "compassionate": {
    "short": "If you are compassionate, you feel other people's pain and struggles as though they were your own.  Compassionate people are often moved to work to end the suffering of others, perhaps by feeding the hungry or educating the poor.",
    "long": "Compassionate comes from the Old French noun compassion, which means \"sympathy, pity.\" The adjective, pronounced \"cuhm-PASH-uh-nuht,\" means \"sympathetic,\" like a compassionate friend who shares in your joys and sadnesses, wanting the best for you. As a verb, compassionate, here pronounced \"cuhm-PASH-uh-nate,\" means \"pity,\" as in your ability to compassionate with stray dogs and cats."
  },
  "intercession": {
    "short": "Intercession is prayer or petition in favor of someone else. When you started wearing a cap of the rival baseball team, your baseball-mad family made an intercession to the gods to save your soul.",
    "long": "An intercession happens when you intercede in something, or act as a mediator or go-between to help solve a problem. Sometimes nations make intercessions in the internal affairs of other nations, if something brutal is happening. In that case, the intercession might involve sending troops, but often intercessions are verbal. If your friend is in trouble, you might make an intercession to try to get her out of trouble, especially if she's not good at explaining herself."
  },
  "affectation": {
    "short": "The guy at your local coffee shop who's never left the state but speaks as though he's lived in London all his life? His British accent is an affectation.",
    "long": "Never confuse affectation with affection — which means “love” or “tenderness.” While affection might not always be genuine, affectation is never the real thing. In fact, affectation is all about faking it. Do you believe the politician cares about poor people, or do you think his concern is an affectation?"
  },
  "circumscribe": {
    "short": "To circumscribe is to limit or restrict. If you spend too much time watching TV instead of fulfilling other obligations, you might circumscribe your TV-watching time to one hour daily (or two hours, if your favorite show is on).",
    "long": "Circumscribe comes from the Latin words circum, meaning \"around,\" and scribere, meaning \"to write.\" If the word circumscribe causes you to think of geometry class, give yourself a pat on the back. In geometry, circumscribe means to draw one geometric figure around another figure so that the two figures touch but don’t intersect. If you studied geometry but this sounds unfamiliar, perhaps you should have taken our advice about watching too much TV."
  },
  "permeable": {
    "short": "Something that is permeable can be passed through, especially by liquids or gases. \"I wish I hadn't worn my permeable sweater to the picnic when the weatherman called for thunderstorms. The rain seeped right through the fabric, soaking me to the skin.\"",
    "long": "A permeable surface allows materials like liquids to pass through — either in or out. Inside the body, the walls of cells are permeable membranes that allow fluids and nutrients to get in and nourish the cells. A permeable shirt is good to wear in the summer, because it helps release the sweat sticking to the skin."
  },
  "recoup": {
    "short": "To recoup is a kind of recovery: If you lost some money but then made that amount back, you recouped your loss.",
    "long": "When you recuperate, you get better after being sick. And when you recoup something, you get better or bounce back after a loss. Businesses that lose money try to recoup it by throwing a sale or cutting their budget. If a runner falls behind in a race but then speeds up to the front of the pack, he's recouped his lead. In some cases this word also means \"to reimburse.\""
  },
  "onerous": {
    "short": "If one teacher gives you three hours of homework a night, that's rough. But if all of your teachers do it, that makes the task of completing your homework an onerous one, to say the least. If something is onerous, it is very difficult to deal with or do.",
    "long": "A near synonym is burdensome. In legal usage, onerous describes a contract or lease that has more obligations than advantages. Onerous derives from Middle English, from Old French onereus, from Latin onerōsus, from onus \"burden.\" In English, an onus is a task or duty that is onerous, or very difficult."
  },
  "adamant": {
    "short": "If you stubbornly refuse to change your mind about something, you are adamant about it.",
    "long": "This word's story begins in ancient Greece, where philosophers spoke about a legendary unbreakable stone or metal they called adamas (literally, \"invincible\"). In English, people began to use the word to refer to something that cannot be altered, and then in the twentieth century — after adamant had been in English for about a thousand years — it came to be used as an adjective to mean \"unyielding as stone.\" If you're adamant about something, no amount of persuasion is going to convince you otherwise."
  },
  "catholic": {
    "short": "When capitalized, Catholic refers to the Catholic Church. With a lower-case \"c,\" catholic means \"universal\" and \"inclusive.\" If you listen to anything from hip-hop to Baroque, you have catholic taste in music.",
    "long": "When it entered the English language in the sixteenth century, catholic simply meant \"general\" or \"common.\" Applied to the Western Church, it essentially meant \"the Church universal,\" or the whole body of Christian believers, as opposed to separate congregations. After the Reformation, the Western Church called itself the Catholic Church to distinguish itself from communities of faith that were no longer obedient to Rome. This usage remains the most common, although you can still use catholic to mean general."
  },
  "monochromatic": {
    "short": "If everything in your room is pink, your room is monochromatic — all of one color.",
    "long": "In physics, monochromatic describes light that has the same wavelength so it is one color. Broken into Greek roots, the word shows its meaning: monos means one, and khroma means color. Things that are truly monochromatic are rare — examine the green leaves of trees and you'll see lots of different shades."
  },
  "euphoria": {
    "short": "Use euphoria to describe a feeling of great happiness and well-being, but know that euphoria often more than that––it's unusually, crazy happy, over the top.",
    "long": "Euphoria can even be classified as a mental illness. The earliest use of euphoria was to describe the relief provided by a medical procedure. The word was borrowed from New Latin, from the Greek word meaning \"ability to bear easily, fertility,\" from euphoros \"healthy,\" from the prefix eu- \"good, well\" plus pherein \"to bear.\""
  },
  "arable": {
    "short": "If you describe land as arable, it means that something can grow there. If you're looking to raise crops, you better find yourself a patch of arable land.",
    "long": "Arable has its Latin roots in the word arare, which means \"to plow.\" Arable soil is ground that can be plowed and cultivated. Chances are — if you are using the word arable, then either the word land or the word soil is following it; however, you might also see the phrase \"arable crops\" — meaning those crops that are able to be grown on arable land."
  },
  "explore": {
    "short": "Explore is a verb that means \"to travel in or through.\" You might explore an island, a European city, or the rooms of an unfamiliar house.",
    "long": "The Latin root of explore is explorare, meaning \"investigate or search out.\" When you explore a new place, you want to see interesting things and get to know its people. Whenever you delve into something, or investigate it, you explore it. You can even explore an interest, like when you explore African art, or explore an idea or tendency in order to understand it — you can explore your fear of snakes to try to get over it."
  },
  "sedative": {
    "short": "A  sedative is a drug that calms you down. If a patient is freaking out about getting an MRI or minor surgery, the doctor might prescribe a sedative to chill them out.",
    "long": "A sedative is anything that makes you sedate — peaceful, calm, tranquil. In medicine this word refers to drugs that relieve anxiety or tranquilizers that pretty much knock you out. But other non-pharmaceutical things can have sedative effects, like a soothing cup of tea or a relaxing glass of wine. The tryptophan in turkey is actually a natural sedative — that's why everyone is sleepy after Thanksgiving dinner!"
  },
  "voluntary": {
    "short": "Voluntary is an adjective that describes something you do because you want to, without being influenced or forced into it. Usually a voluntary act is something you consciously choose to do, like going into work even on a snow day.",
    "long": "Voluntary comes from the Latin word voluntarius, which means \"of one's free will.\" Voluntary can also describe a service given without any payment expected in return. For example, if your work for the community theater is voluntary, that means that you don't get paid for your time. If you're offering your voluntary help in this way, you might also be called a volunteer, someone who offers free help to assist others."
  },
  "precise": {
    "short": "Precise means strictly correct or very exact. If you need something to be precise, like the positioning of a safety net for a stunt jump over a canyon, there's no room for error.",
    "long": "The word precise might make you think of a scientist carefully measuring the mass of a chemical for an experiment or an accountant double checking her calculations. But there's value to being precise in less formal situations as well. When making a grilled cheese sandwich, for example, it’s important that the arrangement of ingredients be precise: place a tomato in each corner and ensure that the cheese covers every inch of bread so that each bite is full of gooey delight."
  },
  "contact": {
    "short": "Contact is the act of touching or communicating with someone or something else. The question increasingly isn't whether there is other life in the universe, but how on earth we will ever make contact with it.",
    "long": "\"To make contact\" (the noun) means to establish some form of communication, be it physical, verbal, or some other kind. To contact (the verb) means to establish that communication. If you're looking to contact Madonna, good luck. She's got people whose only job it is to prevent folks like you from making contact with her. Batteries have two contacts, one positive and one negative. They are where the battery makes contact with the thing to which it provides power."
  },
  "indefatigable": {
    "short": "Someone who is indefatigable can go on for a very long time without becoming tired. You might not be so happy to have an indefatigable guide on your walking trip––you'll have blisters, but she'll see no reason not to keep going.",
    "long": "Indefatigable comes   from Latin indefatigabilis, formed from the prefix in- \"not\" plus defatigare \"to tire out.\" Here the prefix de- means \"entirely.\" You can remember the root fatigare because it sounds so much like the English fatigue."
  },
  "locomotive": {
    "short": "A locomotive is a train car that pulls the other cars along the track. It's most common to see a locomotive at the front or back of the train—and sometimes both.",
    "long": "On a freight train, every single car is loaded with cargo that's being transported—like grain, steel, coal, or lumber—except for the locomotive. Its only job is to power the entire train, either pulling it, or pushing it from the rear. As an adjective, locomotive means \"relating to movement,\" like the locomotive power of a vehicle. This word comes from the Latin roots loco, \"from a place,\" and motivus, \"moving.\""
  },
  "egress": {
    "short": "If you want to leave a place, you need a means of egress, or a way to exit, such as a door or window. It was a beautiful old house, but without enough ways of egress, they needed outdoor fire-stairs for reaching the upper floors.",
    "long": "Egress comes from a Latin word meaning \"going out.\" An egress is basically the same thing as an exit. (Egress can also be used as a verb, \"to exit,\" but less frequently than as a noun.) When buildings undergo inspection, one of the main safety features under review is the number and placement of doors and windows, the \"means of egress,\" in case of fire or other emergency."
  },
  "canard": {
    "short": "During a political campaign, you will often hear on TV commercials some canard about the opponent. This is a false, deluding statement designed to confuse the voters, as it presents the other candidate in a bad light by spreading an untruth.",
    "long": "The Old French word quanart, \"duck,\" morphed into canard, as in \"vendre un canard à moitié,\" which refers to \"half-selling\" a duck, or cheating someone, and the word came to mean something meant to fool someone deliberately. Poet James Whitcomb Riley said, \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\" Not always the case with canard."
  },
  "acquiesce": {
    "short": "To acquiesce is to agree to something or to give in. If your kid sister is refusing to hand over the television remote, you hope she acquiesces before your favorite show comes on.",
    "long": "The verb acquiesce comes from the Latin word acquiescere, meaning “to rest.” If you “rest” or become passive in the face of something to which you object, you are giving tacit agreement. In other words, you acquiesce. If you want to go hiking with your family and your children are not interested, it will be a very tough day on the trail until they acquiesce."
  },
  "astute": {
    "short": "Someone who is astute is clever and has good judgment. The kid running around with a bucket stuck on his head? Not so astute.",
    "long": "Astute (from Latin) is a formal and flattering adjective for someone with a good head on their shoulders. It differs from its synonym shrewd in placing less emphasis on hardheadedness than on sensitivity: we talk about a shrewd bargainer but an astute interpretation. Other synonyms are perceptive (emphasizing insight) and discerning (emphasizing an ability to distinguish)."

  "decry": {
    "short": "When you dye your hair pink and orange, your mother decries your act as a horror and bursts into tears. She criticizes your choice of colors, stating that pink and purple would have looked better.",
    "long": "You might decry learning French, declaring it as a waste of time. Yet many English words come from French. When the French conquered England in 1066, they brought with them their language as well as their social system. Because French was spoken mostly by the ruling class, many of the loan words are formal. Decry comes from the Old French descrier, \"to cry out\" or \"announce.\" When you decry something, you simultaneously condemn it and discredit it, a formal act."
  },
  "oblivion": {
    "short": "Oblivion is the state of being forgotten. Your uncle dreamed of being a rock star, but after recording one hit song, he faded into oblivion.",
    "long": "Oblivion can also mean \"total forgetfulness\" — like what patients with dementia or new parents feel. If you find yourself putting the crackers in the fridge and milk in the cupboards, or forgetting your own phone number, you might be experiencing oblivion. Enjoy it while it lasts."

  "gainsay": {
    "short": "Gainsay, a verb, means \"contradict\" or \"speak out against.\" When you challenge authority, you gainsay, as in teachers don't like it when unruly students gainsay them.",
    "long": "Gainsay comes from an Old English word that means \"contradict\" or \"say against,\" as in, \"no one dared gainsay the principal, who is well-known for giving detention to students who so much as frown at him.\" If you know someone who constantly corrects others, tells them that they're wrong, and says, \"That's not true,\" more than anyone else, you have first-hand experience with the art of the gainsay."
  },
  "precedence": {
    "short": "Notice the verb \"precede\" in the noun precedence, and you'll be able to remember that precedence is the act of preceding, of coming before — either in time or in rank.",
    "long": "When you're stranded without food or water, the search for water should definitely take precedence over the search for food, since you'll die of dehydration long before you starve. When deciding where to seat people, restaurant owners give precedence to the famous and rich: making them happy will be good for business. Which things take precedence over others depends on what you think is more important. \"Age before beauty,\" I always say."
  },
  "antedate": {
    "short": "When things antedate something else, they come before it, or happen earlier than it does. World\r\nWar I antedates World War II.",
    "long": "Another way to say antedate is precede or predate. It's common to find the word antedate when people talk about history, for obvious reasons. Papyrus antedates modern paper, and paper antedates the desktop computer, which antedates the smartphone and tablet. Your parents' birth antedates your own, and your great-grandparents' lives antedate both yours and your parents'. In Latin, the prefix ante means \"before.\""
  },
  "efface": {
    "short": "If something is erased or rubbed out, it has been effaced. Teachers get annoyed to find that someone has effaced the blackboard — even the part clearly marked, \"Do Not Erase!\"",
    "long": "You can also efface things that are not physical — like effacing feelings, impressions, or memories. When you efface a memory, you wipe it out as well. Some people believe that their good deeds are able to efface their past wrongs. They'll have to rely on others' opinions to see how well that works."
  },
  "modish": {
    "short": "Something modish is fashionable and stylish. It's a-la-mode, or right on top of the latest look. In the 1970s, it was considered modish to wear bell bottoms.",
    "long": "The word modish is a combination of the French mode meaning \"fashion\" and the suffix -ish meaning \"very common.\" When something is modish, it's all the rage. A swanky restaurant where it's hard to get a table or a boutique selling the newest designer labels are considered modish, or in vogue. Open up the pages of Vogue and you'll be accosted with the latest modish looks."
  },
  "gouge": {
    "short": "To gouge can mean to make a hole or dent in something, or to swindle or steal by overcharging. If your local gas station raises prices because a storm is coming, you may say that the station owner is gouging you — and that's illegal.",
    "long": "The verb gouge means to cut or carve. You can use special chisels to gouge linoleum for interesting design in printing. As a noun, a gouge is the tool you would use — instead of a flat-head chisel, a gouge has a trough — to make the gouge marks of the design. Another meaning of the verb gouge is an indentation in the surface of something. If you're not careful with the screwdriver, you'll accidentally gouge a hole in the wall."
  },
  "confront": {
    "short": "Confront means either to face a situation that makes you uncomfortable, or to say something to someone about something they've done that bothers you. Rather than letting things go, when people are rude to you you should confront them.",
    "long": "Confront derives from the Latin con- \"with\" and -front \"front.\" You can confront a sad truth, you can confront a person by calling them on their behavior, you can confront someone with the fact that they have terrible breath. You can be confronted, too—on the trip through the mountains, we were confronted by the impassibility of the road."
  },
  "herb": {
    "short": "What do food, medicine, and perfume have in common? Well, they all can be created from herbs. An herb is a plant that has a soft rather than a woody stem, and it tends to have a unique taste or smell.",
    "long": "There are many kinds of plants, but one that you've likely seen mentioned on a menu or ad for a medical treatment is the herb. Herbs are distinguished from other plants by their stem, which does not become permanent and woody; instead, it stays soft. Many herbs are used in cooking, such as basil and thyme, because they add flavor to foods. Many herbs, like ginseng and chamomile, are used in tea and are believed to be good for your health."
  },
  "detest": {
    "short": "If you detest something, you dislike it intensely. The word can apply to things and also to people. You might detest your ex-boyfriend and you might also detest rainy Mondays and broccoli.",
    "long": "Detest comes from the Middle French word détester, meaning \"to curse, to call God to witness and abhor.\" Though the words detest and hate are interchangeable, the word hate is much more common, which has caused it to lose some of its hateful impact. Detest is used more sparingly, reserved for cases where no other word will do, where your feelings of dislike are so powerful that they need just the right word to sum them up."
  },
  "plead": {
    "short": "To plead with someone is to try to convince them to see it your way. Your kids may plead with you to let them go on the super-huge outrageous roller coaster built in 1968, but you know better.",
    "long": "The term plead comes from the word plea, which is from the legal system, where lawyers make a plea to the court and argue a case for their client. To plead is to ask for something from someone, often on the verge of begging. You may plead with the phone company to give an appointment time that spans only three hours, but, regardless of your pleading, they will make you wait eight hours for the technician to finally show."
  },
  "disassemble": {
    "short": "The verb disassemble means to take something apart. It's one thing to disassemble a computer; it's a whole other thing to put it back together again.",
    "long": "If you take your car to the repair shop to have a squeaky brake fixed, you'll be surprised to see the mechanics quickly disassemble your car, removing even its wheels and doors. You can use the word disassemble whenever something's dismantled or broken into pieces. Originally, disassemble meant \"to disperse,\" or to stop a crowd of people from assembling, but the meaning changed to its current definition in the 1600s."
  },
  "vitiate": {
    "short": "As some sneaky five-year-olds know, crossing one’s fingers while making a promise is an effective way to vitiate, or destroy the validity of, an agreement.",
    "long": "Vitiate is often used when a legal agreement is made invalid, but it can also refer to the debasement or corruption of something or someone. If a malicious five-year-old on the playground teaches the other children to lie with their fingers crossed, she would be responsible for vitiating the playground community. The first syllable of this word is pronounced \"vish,\" like the first syllable in vicious."
  },
  "lull": {
    "short": "See lull, think \"calm.\" It could be the noun form (like \"the lull before the storm\") or the verb: one can lull someone by calming them (as in lulling a baby to sleep with a lullaby).",
    "long": "The noun lull is often used in relation to a storm, but the term has a broader meaning as well. Lull can be used to describe any temporary period of calm or diminished activity, like the quiet time before the lunch rush in a restaurant or the brief period of tranquility before the doors open for a pre-Christmas sale. The word's verb form means \"to soothe or to make someone feel relaxed.\" When used as a verb lull can turn deceptive, and it is often used to convey a false sense of security."
  },
  "demote": {
    "short": "To demote someone is to move them into a less important job. Your coffee shop boss might demote you to wiping tables if your attempts to froth milk and pull espresso shots continuously fail.",
    "long": "When your employer demotes you, she assigns you an easier task or even an entirely new, lower-ranked position. You may even earn less money. In the military, to demote is to move a soldier down in rank, usually as a punishment. The opposite of demote is promote, which came first. The prefix de- gives the word a sense of \"down\" or \"down from.\""
  },
  "immigrate": {
    "short": "When a person immigrates, he or she moves to a new country.  During the great wave of immigration between 1880 and 1924, over 25 million Europeans immigrated to the United States.",
    "long": "Many immigrants make significant contributions to their adopted countries. Consider Albert Einstein, the greatest physicist of the twentieth century, who immigrated to America from Germany, or the Russian-born New Yorker Irving Berlin, who wrote some of the most popular songs in the American songbook, including  “White Christmas” and “God Bless America.\"  The word immigrate comes from the Latin imigrare, which means “to move in.”"
  },
  "literal": {
    "short": "To describe something as literal is to say that it is exactly what it seems to be. For example, if you put up a literal barrier to keep the world out, you've actually built a real wall.",
    "long": "The background of literal includes the Latin litterālis, meaning \"of letters or writing.\" This led to the sense of exactness, suggesting something is \"to the letter.\"  Many people misuse this word, as in \"Listening to that dull teacher put me in a literal coma.\" Possible, but highly doubtful."

  "luminous": {
    "short": "Luminous means full of or giving off light. During the winter holidays, with all their emphasis on light, you can see luminous displays of candles everywhere.",
    "long": "This word has several figurative meanings that are related to the basic sense of something shining. For example, luminous prose is clear and easily understood. And a luminous career is bright and inspiring. The Middle English adjective is from Latin luminosus, from lumen \"light.\""
  },
  "intrinsic": {
    "short": "The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature. An intrinsic quality of dogs is that they're loyal.",
    "long": "Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you have no other motivation. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic, for things that come from the outside instead of from the inside."
  },
  "harbor": {
    "short": "A harbor is a safe place providing refuge and comfort. If you're traveling, the harbor provided by a warm hotel is welcome. For ships, a harbor is a sheltered port area shielded from waves, where it's safe to dock.",
    "long": "Harbor can also be used as a verb, which describes maintaining a belief or a feeling. If you harbor ill-will toward your neighbor John, you don't like him much. Harbor can also mean you hold back your ideas and don't express them openly. John may have no idea you hate him if you harbor your true feelings deep inside, but pretend you like him to his face."
  },
  "orthography": {
    "short": "If you speak English — and you probably do if you're reading this — an orthography or writing system of \"A, B, C, D...\" makes sense. The Serbian language uses a different orthography: \"A B C Č Ć D Dž Đ...\"",
    "long": "From Greek orthographia, meaning \"correct writing,\" an orthography is a way to represent words by having set ways to spell and write them. Orthography helps you identify words so you can figure out their meanings. Different languages usually have different systems of orthography, and even subsets of language, like text-messaging lingo, have a sort of orthography."
  },
  "pertinent": {
    "short": "Something pertinent is relevant and on-point. If you give your best friend pertinent advice, that means the advice is appropriate for the situation.",
    "long": "Something pertinent is related to the current topic or situation — and probably helpful too. If you're in math class and you make a comment about World War I, that's likely not pertinent. If you're in music class and you talk about a cello, that probably is pertinent. Pertinent things are appropriate and logical. In most situations, people like to get comments and questions that are pertinent — anything else can just seem like a distraction."
  },
  "pejorative": {
    "short": "Call a word or phrase pejorative if it is used as a disapproving expression or a term of abuse. Tree-hugger is a pejorative term for an environmentalist.",
    "long": "Coming from the Latin word for \"worse,\" pejorative is both an adjective and a noun. As an adjective, it means disapproving or disparaging. Hack is a pejorative term for a bad writer. If you call someone a politician in the pejorative sense, you mean that they are scheming and out for personal gain. Terms of abuse such as jerk and negative euphemisms such as bottom feeder are pejoratives, words you use when you want to call someone a bad name."
  },
  "remarkable": {
    "short": "Something remarkable is unusual, exceptional, interesting, or excellent. Remarkable things get your attention.",
    "long": "If you take this word literally, you can figure out the meaning: remarkable things make you want to make a remark about them. They get you talking because they're so unusual or good. Getting a B on a test isn't remarkable, unless you usually get D’s. Getting to meet the president would be pretty remarkable. Save this word for things that are really and truly exceptional."
  },
  "explicable": {
    "short": "Can you understand your chemistry teacher's explanation of how to do an experiment? Then it's explicable, able to be comprehended clearly and accurately.",
    "long": "Since the 16th century, the adjective explicable has been used for things that are intelligible or that can be solved. It comes from the Latin explicabilis, \"capable of being unraveled,\" and its root, explicare, \"unfold or explain.\" These days you're most likely to find it in academic or formal writing, not always the most explicable of genres."
  },
  "auspicious": {
    "short": "Use the adjective auspicious for a favorable situation or set of conditions. If you start a marathon by falling flat on your face, that's not an auspicious start.",
    "long": "If something seems likely to bring success — either because it creates favorable conditions or you just consider it a lucky sign — label it auspicious. The word is related to auspice, \"a divine omen,\" an old word with a colorful history. In Latin, an auspex was a person who observed the flight of birds to predict things about the future. Luckily, you no longer have to be a bird-watching fortune-teller to guess whether something is auspicious or not."
  },
  "calligraphy": {
    "short": "Ever see a framed diploma in your doctor's office filled with fancy old fashioned curvy handwriting announcing they trained at such and such a university? Well, that style of writing is calligraphy, and it's mostly used for important public documents.",
    "long": "The word calligraphy comes from two Greek words stuck together, kallos, meaning \"beauty,\" and graphein, meaning \"to write\" — literally \"beautiful writing.\" In the days before printing was invented, all books and documents were written by hand using calligraphy, the most famous examples being the bibles written by medieval monks."
  },
  "repository": {
    "short": "Think of a repository as a storehouse, a place where things are kept until needed. A silo is a repository for animal feed, and a trivia buff's mind is a repository for useless information.",
    "long": "The noun repository has a somewhat formal ring to it — why not just call a storehouse a storehouse, right? Think of a repository as somewhat more important and imposing than just a place to dump stuff. It has more of an air of authority, like the things stored there could change the world. Consider nuclear waste — would you rather store it in a dump or a repository? I don’t know about you, but I'd prefer the latter—sounds safer."
  },
  "reclaim": {
    "short": "To reclaim something is to get it back. If a divorced couple remarries, they reclaim their marriage.",
    "long": "To claim is to declare or take ownership of something. To reclaim is to retake something lost. An injured quarterback must reclaim the starting position from his replacement. Two countries fighting over territory may lose and reclaim an area of land. A bank can reclaim a house if you don't make mortgage payments. Reclaim comes from the Old French reclamer, \"to call back,\" which is rooted in the Latin word reclamare, \"cry out against, or appeal.\""
  },
  "scourge": {
    "short": "If something makes people miserable or causes them great pain and torment, it's a scourge. A corrupt government is one kind of scourge, and a plague of insects that destroys a farmer's crops is another kind of scourge.",
    "long": "Dating from the 13th century, scourge originally meant \"a whip used as punishment.\" It wasn't long until the figurative meaning of \"something causing pain or misery\" became even more common. A scourge tends to be something that causes folks to suffer terribly, whether it's a tsunami or unjust laws. You can also use this word as a verb: \"Cutting the city's transportation budget will do nothing but scourge people without cars.\""
  },
  "consecutive": {
    "short": "If things are consecutive, they happen one after the other with no break. If there are five consecutive snowstorms on five consecutive days,   you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.",
    "long": "Consecutive comes from the Latin consecutus, meaning \"following closely\" with no gap. Just like those snowstorms — one storm happened each day, back to back, for five days in a row. Consecutive numbers also follow each other, or advance in the right order. For example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are consecutive numbers. You should number the pages on a term paper to keep them consecutive so the teacher doesn't get confused."
  },
  "caprice": {
    "short": "On a whim, he sold everything and left the city for the beautiful wilderness of Alaska, but his act of caprice felt a lot less whimsical when he realized how freezing cold Alaska is.",
    "long": "The word caprice has its roots in the French for \"whim,\" which comes from the Italian word capriccio for \"fright\" or \"sudden start.\" A caprice can be just a fun impulsive act, but it also can be something done on a quick whim, without thinking it through or preparing for the change in direction. Having a sudden liking, or caprice, for someone or something can be short-lived too."
  },
  "abstinent": {
    "short": "Someone who's abstinent is moderate and restrained, especially when it comes to consuming food and drink. A person who quits drinking alcohol completely is abstinent.",
    "long": "It's most common to use the adjective abstinent to describe someone who has given up using alcohol or other intoxicants, but you can also use it to talk about a person who's self-restrained in other ways. You might say, \"No dessert for me — I'm trying to be abstinent this month!\" Abstinent is an Old French word meaning \"moderate\" or \"modest,\" from the Latin abstinere, \"to refrain from.\""
  },
  "codify": {
    "short": "To codify is to arrange information in a logical order that others can follow. Legislators may try to codify, or gather and organize, all laws related to a particular issue.",
    "long": "When you look at the word codify you can probably guess that it's related to the word code. Warriors live by a code. Building inspectors check that a building and its systems are up to code. Hockey players use \"the code\" to determine when — and why — to fight on the ice. All of these codes are clear to the people who use them because someone in the past made an effort to codify the various rules into an organized system."
  },
  "benign": {
    "short": "Someone or something that is benign is gentle, kind, mild, or unharmful: a benign soul wouldn't hurt a fly.",
    "long": "Benign describes a range of qualities, all of them positive. When talking about a person, it means \"gentle.\" In reference to weather or climate, it means \"mild.\" In some other contexts, it simply means \"not harmful\" — you might speak of \"a benign tumor\" or \"an environmentally benign chemical.\" The word comes from a Latin root benignus meaning \"well born,\" but the implied meaning is \"kind\" or \"pleasant\" — it's hard to get mad at someone who has a benign disposition."
  },
  "infer": {
    "short": "When you infer something, you read between the lines. To infer  is to make a well informed guess — if you see your mom’s bag on the table, you might infer that she’s home.",
    "long": "When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they mean but haven't actually said. It’s like guessing, but not making wild guesses. You're making deductions — guesses based on logic. Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a scientist has part of a dinosaur fossil and can infer what the rest of the dinosaur looked like. When you see the word infer, think \"educated guess.\""
  },
  "ally": {
    "short": "If you have an ally, you have someone who is on your side, like a more experienced teammate who is your ally in convincing the coach to give you more playing time.",
    "long": "Ally comes from the Latin word alligare, meaning \"to bind to,\" like nations who are allies in wartime — they will act together, and protect one another. You can also use ally as a verb, meaning \"join forces with.\" For example, you might ally yourself with influential people to advance your career. As a noun, pronounce ally like this: \"AL-eye.\" As a verb, it's \"uh-LIE.\""
  },
  "linen": {
    "short": "Linen is a type of fabric that's sturdy, cool, and absorbent. If you're going to a summer wedding, you should consider wearing a white linen suit. If you're going on a job interview, it's probably not such a great idea.",
    "long": "Linen is frequently used in summery dresses and shirts, curtains, bags, pillowcases and sheets, towels. and tablecloths. It's heavy and substantial but stays breathable and fresh when you wear it on a hot day. Linens is sometimes used to mean \"bedding or towels,\" or the things you'd keep in a linen closet. Linen comes from the Old English word linin, \"made of flax,\" from lin, \"flax fibers or linen thread.\""
  },
  "fortitude": {
    "short": "Fortitude refers to strength in the face of adversity or difficulty. Eating fried worms might require a lot of intestinal fortitude.",
    "long": "When someone has fortitude it means that they have emotional power or reserves and the ability to withstand adversity. People who have fortitude are described in an admiring way for their courage and this word comes from the Latin word fortitudo, meaning \"strength.\" Jacueline Bisset, someone who knows about beauty, said, \"Character contributes to beauty. It fortifies a woman as her youth fades. A mode of conduct, a standard of courage, discipline, fortitude and integrity can do a great deal to make a woman beautiful.\""
  },
  "consistent": {
    "short": "If you get the same Donkey Kong score every time you play, you're consistent. It's consistent with video-game addiction, however, that you will continue to play in the hopes of beating that score.",
    "long": "Consistent is related to the word consist, which refers to what something is made of—\"bread dough consists of flour, water, and salt.\" Consistency describes texture—a consistent consistency would be brownies as rock-hard in the center as they are at the edge––hopefully, next time you bake you'll get inconsistent results."
  },
  "sanction": {
    "short": "Sanction has two nearly opposite meanings: to sanction can be to approve of something, but it can also mean to punish, or speak harshly to. Likewise, a sanction can be a punishment or approval. Very confusing — the person who invented this word should be publicly sanctioned!",
    "long": "See if you can guess the meaning of sanction in the following contexts. Before invading Iraq, the U.S. and its allies first imposed sanctions on the country, refusing to supply the country with much-needed trade items. Did you guess that sanction = \"punishment\"? You were right! But by trading with China at the same time, the U.S. quietly sanctioned that nation's known instances of human rights abuses. Did you guess that sanction = \"approval\"? You're right again!"
  },
  "fortification": {
    "short": "A fortification is a strong wall, building, or other reinforced structure that's used to defend against attack. In medieval times, castle fortifications protected them from invading armies.",
    "long": "If you've ever built a fort in your living room or back yard, you know what a fortification is—fort is the shortened form, and the source word is the Latin fortificare, \"make strong.\" Another meaning of fortification is \"the act of making something (or someone) stronger,\" so you might talk about the fortification your math team got from taking an online calculus class or the fortification of your favorite breakfast cereal with vitamins."
  },
  "migrate": {
    "short": "To migrate means to move from one place to another, sometimes part of a back-and-forth pattern, and sometimes to stay.",
    "long": "When we think of the word migrate we think of movement from place to place. Sometimes that movement is seasonal, as when birds migrate north in summer and south in winter. But sometimes a person or group will migrate from one place to another with the intention of settling there. In both cases, there is a definite shift in locales, one temporary, the other permanent."

  "pompous": {
    "short": "A pompous person is arrogant or conceited. He'll walk into a party with an inflated ego, ready to tell anyone who will listen that \"I'm kind of a big deal.\"",
    "long": "Today we associate the adjective pompous with self-important jerks. But it's actually derived from the Old French pompeux, which meant “stately.\" And that's why you can also use pompous to describe something with a lot of ceremonial or stately display — in other words, something surrounded by \"pomp and circumstance.\""
  },
  "epistemology": {
    "short": "Epistemology is the study of knowledge: what we know, how we know it, how we know we know it, and how to keep track of it without driving ourselves crazy.",
    "long": "You might be wondering if epistemology is just a hobby for people who know too much for their own good, but epistemology has a lot of uses. The study of knowledge leads to the study of learning, which leads to better methods of teaching. The study of knowledge helps us understand our cultural differences, which helps us all get along. Probably the coolest use of epistemology, though, is artificial intelligence: teaching computers how to learn."

    "long": "The new stadium is a great facility for showing off Olympic winter sports. At this level, all of the ice skaters show a facility that borders on magical. Likewise, the prison is a great facility for storing prisoners. Those prisoners showed a real facility for crime. Related to the French facile, which means \"easy,\" a person who shows a facility for something makes it seem easy. This is cool, especially if that thing is difficult — or, as the French might say, difficile."

    "long": "Address is a word that's long been associated with correspondence — the street number, city, state, and postal code that must be on the front of any envelope if it's going to arrive at its destination. In the digital age, an address has also come to mean the location where you might e-mail your friend pictures of your dog dressed up in a birthday hat. If you wanted to tell that friend about your dog's birthday party in person, you might address her directly. Address to describe a way of speaking is usually reserved for more formal occasions, such as when the President addresses the nation."
  },
  "accede": {
    "short": "If you accede, it means you agree with someone or give in to his or her wish.  The word is often used in a political context — the Queen acceded to the Prince's demands for more territory, a larger army, and funnier jesters.",
    "long": "Accede can also be used for everyday situations.  If you accede to your mother's request that you come home before ten, it means you'll be missing that midnight movie with your friends.   Accede comes from the Latin accedere, meaning to \"approach or enter upon.\"  It differs slightly from concede, which also means consent, but a more reluctant kind. If you were to concede to your mom's 10 PM curfew rather than accede to it, you'd be doing so against your will."
  },
  "pallid": {
    "short": "Santa looks a little pallid, meaning that he has a pale complexion, from spending too much time at the North Pole. A few days in Hawaii might do wonders to add color to his pale, bearded face.",
    "long": "Pallid means pale, or lacking color. It's often used together with complexion to describe someone who has a pale face, either due to a lack of sunshine or some kind of emotional distress.

  "futile": {
    "short": "When something fails to deliver a useful result, you can call it futile. Hopefully all the time you're spending studying vocabulary won't turn out to be futile!",
    "long": "Futile comes from the Latin futilis, which originally meant \"leaky.\" Although we use futile to talk about more than buckets, the image of a leaky vessel is a good illustration of the adjective. Pouring water into a leaky bucket is futile.  Your exercise program will be futile if you don't stop chowing down on chocolate. Futile is fancier than its synonym useless. Other synonyms are fruitless or vain. The i can be either short (FYOO-t'l) or long (FYOO-tile)."

  "villain": {
    "short": "A villain is a bad person — real or made up. In books, movies, current events, or history, the villain is the character who does mean, evil things on purpose.",
    "long": "Today a villain is a wicked person, whether in fact or fiction. In the 1300s, villain described a low-born rustic. It came from the Medieval Latin word villanus, or farmhand. Just why a word would evolve from meaning farmer into evildoer is a little mysterious, although it probably has to do with farmers not being chivalrous, like the knights who were so admired in those days."
  },
  "wanton": {
    "short": "Wanton describes something excessive, uncontrolled and sometimes even cruel. The principal sees a food fight as a wanton act of vandalism done with wanton disregard for the rules, but the kids might just see it as fun.",
    "long": "Wanton comes from the Old English wan- \"lacking\" and togen \"to train, discipline,\" in other words, \"lacking in discipline.\" Wanton extravagance is excessive and uncontrolled, whereas a wanton act of terrorism is random and intentionally cruel. Sometimes in older novels, you will see wanton used as a disapproving term to describe someone viewed as promiscuous, a usage that is considered old-fashioned today."
  },
  "autocratic": {
    "short": "Autocratic describes a way of ruling, but not in a nice way. An autocratic leader is one who rules with an iron fist; in other words — someone with the behavior of a dictator.",
    "long": "Autocratic rulers don't tend to be popular. They use fear and control to gain total power over their people. Often, their country is left destitute as a result of their actions. The word autocratic is often used to describe the head of a country, but really, anyone who is a despotic leader can qualify — including the boss who threatens to fire you if you refuse to polish his shoes and work every holiday."
  },
  "flirt": {
    "short": "If you're interested in someone romantically, you might flirt with them, which means to chat them up or tease them in a playful way.",
    "long": "Flirting is an indirect and fun way to let your crush know you're interested, like a seductive line or a few coy words. Or if there's a girl you've had your eye on, you might make a point of walking by her desk and saying hello every morning. But even if you don't have a love interest, you can still flirt. Driving carelessly is flirting with disaster: it's almost like you're toying with the idea of getting into an accident."
  },
  "manipulate": {
    "short": "To manipulate something means to handle it skillfully, like the way a sculptor manipulates clay or a really good politician works a crowd.",
    "long": "The verb manipulate evolved from manipulation, which back in the 1700s referred to a method of digging ore. So manipulating something originally only meant moving or arranging it by hand or mechanically. It wasn't until 1864 that people started using the word manipulate to describe someone exerting mental or emotional influence on others."
  },
  "snobbery": {
    "short": "Use the noun snobbery when you talk about someone's habit of treating other people as inferior. If your friend doesn't want to associate with people who have less money than she does, it's proof of her snobbery.",
    "long": "Snobbery is an unattractive trait caused by a person's belief that he or she is inherently better than others. Most snobbery has to do with social class and the idea that someone who has more money or went to a fancier school is worthier than someone who doesn't have these advantages. The root of snobbery is snob, which in 1800's British slang meant \"person of the lower classes,\" but changed over time to mean \"one who despises those considered inferior.\""
  },
  "bay": {
    "short": "A bay is an inlet along the shoreline of a body of water.  A bay window occupies a similar inlet in a room.  When you keep someone \"at bay\" you hold them off.",
    "long": "The different meanings of bay come from different origins. For example, the idea of the word as a cove comes from the Latin bāia, while the idea of an opening is a wall is from the Latin batāre, meaning \"gape.\" The word that means a dog's howl, however, comes from the Latin baubari, which means \"to bark.\" Other meanings of this versatile word include a horse with reddish coloring, and a tree with leaves used to add flavor in cooking.  There's nothing quite like riding a bay along the scenic bay while listening to the hounds bay!"
  },
  "somber": {
    "short": "Somber is used to describe situations, facial expressions, or moods that are dark, gloomy, or depressing. Funerals are usually somber affairs.",
    "long": "Somber is a slightly formal word. If you have bad or super important news, deliver it in a somber manner otherwise people won’t understand how serious you are. Bad news can put a person in a somber mood. The word somber is derived from the Latin sub umbrā, \"under a shadow,\" and it can also describe dull colors, like brown, grey, or black."
  },
  "labyrinth": {
    "short": "A labyrinth is a structure with many connected paths or passages in which it is hard to find your way. In figurative use, a labyrinth is a complicated situation: our tax code is a labyrinth of rules and regulations.",
    "long": "In Greek mythology, the Labyrinth was the structure built for King Minos of Crete to confine the Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The word maze is a near synonym for labyrinth, and is also used figuratively, as in, \"After war broke out, trying to figure out how to get a visa to leave the country was like navigating a maze, a veritable labyrinth of wrong turns and false hope.\""
  },
  "torment": {
    "short": "By repeatedly trying to make someone miserable you torment them. The noun torment is the result of the verb torment.",
    "long": "After stealing the old lady's purse, you might expect to be tormented by many sleepless nights. Those nights without sleep will torment (tor-MENT) you. They are your torment (TOR-ment). Perhaps you shouldn't have done that.\r\n\r\nYou'll doubtless notice the relationship between torture and torment. But the subtle difference between them is that to torment someone is to torture them repeatedly. Often this is used metaphorically. For example, calling someone over and over to demand payment isn't actually torture, but it's certainly a way to torment them."
  },
  "minatory": {
    "short": "Minatory means threatening. When you petition the school for higher academic standards — i.e. harder grading from teachers — you may receive some minatory looks, or even hate notes, from the kids in your school.",
    "long": "Minatory derives from the Latin menatorius, \"menace,\" and has nothing at all to do with the Greek legends of the Minotaur. But think of the Minotaur anyway — it was half-man, half-bull, lived inside a labyrinth, and could only be appeased if it was being sent young women to devour. If that's not threatening (or minatory) behavior, nothing is."
  },
  "inter": {
    "short": "Inter means to bury, usually in a tomb or grave. If you loved your cat a lot, you might want to inter her remains in the back yard and make a nice little memorial.",
    "long": "Most of the time, the word inter is going to be about burying someone or something. Often times, a family owns a plot of land in a cemetery where all family members are interred when they die. Occasionally, you might see it in the phrase \"inter alia,\" a literary Latin expression meaning \"among other things.\" Your professor is probably a poet and a scholar, inter alia."
  },
  "sophistry": {
    "short": "Sophistry is tricking someone by making a seemingly clever argument, like a philosopher who argues that up is down and somehow convinces you. If you accuse someone of sophistry, you mean they’ll lie to make a point.",
    "long": "The word sophistry has roots in ancient Greece. The Sophists were teachers who were celebrated in their time but were later thought to be more like con artists who would say anything to win an argument. Sophistry is like spin — it means twisting the truth to bend to one’s needs. Politician might accuse people who disagree with them of using sophistry."
  },
  "ferocity": {
    "short": "Ferocity is the state of being ferocious — wild, scary, and fierce. A five year-old girl pretending to be a lion will display her ferocity by roaring and baring her teeth.",
    "long": "Things known for their ferocity include wild animals, terrifying thunder storms, and fierce battlefield fights. A furious argument can have an element of ferocity, and so can a wild, loud piece of music. The Latin word ferus, which means \"wild,\" is the root of not only ferocity, but ferocious and fierce. Ferocity came directly from the Latin ferocitatem, \"fierceness, or wildness.\""
  },
  "epoch": {
    "short": "An epoch is a period of time marked by certain characteristics: you might describe several peaceful decades in a nation's history as an epoch of peace.",
    "long": "In geologic time, an epoch is a division of a period, and an age is a division of an epoch. Epoch can also refer to a distinct and important period of history, or an event that marks such a period: an epoch in the world of ballet, for example. The noun epoch is from New Latin epocha, from Greek epochē, \"pause, check, fixed time.\""
  },
  "desiccate": {
    "short": "The verb desiccate means to dry out, dry up and dehydrate. It's helpful to desiccate weeds but certainly not crops.",
    "long": "As anyone who's been stuck in the desert will tell you, being desiccated by the burning sun isn't much fun. Stemming from the Latin word desiccare, which means to \"dry up,\" desiccate also means to preserve something by drying it out. Without desiccation, raisins or beef jerky would not be possible!"
  },
  "investigate": {
    "short": "To investigate is to look into something systematically. If you don't understand how tornadoes work, for example, investigate the forces of wind and find out.",
    "long": "Investigate still acts a lot like the word it comes from, investigationem meaning \"a searching into,\" which came from the Latin for \"to track a footprint.\" It's exactly what you do when you investigate. You can investigate in the name of science, which is to look into something systematically, like when you research how tornadoes work. If you investigate a person, you find out everything you can — and you might need to hire a private eye for help."
  },
  "quack": {
    "short": "There are good quacks and bad quacks. A good quack is the sound a duck makes. A bad quack is someone pretending to be a doctor. (You'd be better off visiting the duck with your ailment.)",
    "long": "If you ever get a chance to interview a celebrity duck, prepare to write the word quack in your notebook many, many times, because that’s all that ducks can say. The way you spell animal sounds changes depending what language you speak. In English a duck quacks, but in Danish a duck \"raps,\" while Indonesian ducks \"wek,\" and Romanian ducks say \"mac.\" And that \"MD\" who isn’t really a doctor, but is good at pretending to be one? He's a quack. If you ever meet a quack that \"quacks,\" please run."

  "convalescence": {
    "short": "When someone has been severely hurt or very ill, they must go through a period of convalescence during which they rest and recuperate in order to regain their strength and health.  Convalescence varies depending on the severity of the problem.",
    "long": "The Latin convalēscere means \"to regain health.\"  The actual period of convalescence is from when you first  get sick until your complete recovery.  Convalescence for an illness is often accompanied by various medicines, the most effective of which often include TLC and hot chicken soup. Playwright George Bernard Shaw once quipped, \"I enjoy convalescence. It is the part that makes the illness worth while.\""
  },
  "phobia": {
    "short": "A phobia is an intense and irrational fear of something. If seeing a spider makes you scream and jump on top of a table, then you might suffer from a phobia.",
    "long": "The thing to remember about phobia is that it describes an irrational fear. If you’re afraid of a black widow spider, for example, that’s not a phobia — it’s just smart, because the spider is poisonous. If you’re afraid of all spiders, however, and the sight of a harmless daddy long legs spider has you shaking in terror, then you may have a phobia. In this case, it's a phobia because your reaction is irrational."
  },
  "discretion": {
    "short": "If you have the freedom to decide something on your own, the decision is left to your discretion. You're in charge.",
    "long": "Discretion traces back to the Latin verb discernere, \"to separate, to discern,\" from the prefix dis-, \"off, away,\" plus cernere, \"separate, sift.\" If you use discretion, you sift away what is not desirable, keeping only the good. If you have the freedom to choose, something is \"at your discretion.\" Watch out when you hear the phrase \"viewer discretion advised\" on TV or at the movies — you will most likely encounter profanity and violence."
  },
  "benighted": {
    "short": "Being called benighted is much like being called naive. It means lacking in knowledge or understanding—the kind you might have if you were older or more sophisticated.",
    "long": "Although it sounds a lot like \"being knighted\", benighted has nothing to do with knights and, in fact, includes the word \"night\" (as in the opposite of day) and not \"knight\" (as in \"of the Round Table\"). One way to remember what benighted means is to think of a person \"being nighted\" or, put into the dark. A benighted person is in the dark about things: they don't know because they can't see. The Dark Ages are thought to have been a benighted time, full of primitive ideas."

  "legacy": {
    "short": "Use the word, legacy, for something handed down from one generation to the next. A retiring company president might leave a legacy of honesty and integrity.",
    "long": "Legacy comes from the Latin verb, legare \"to appoint by a last will, send as an ambassador.\" Originally, the noun meant \"ambassador\" or \"envoy\" but soon shifted to mean the money and property a person leaves behind in his will. Many university scholarships are funded by the legacies of former students. In recent usage, political leaders are said to be concerned with their legacies, the historically significant achievements of their tenure in office."

    "short": "Something obvious is plain to see and easily understandable. It was obvious that you didn't enjoy your meal because I found it rolled in a napkin and shoved under the rug.",
    "long": "There's nothing vague about the adjective obvious — it's right there in front of your eyes! It describes something that's easy to figure out or the most straightforward option. If someone states the obvious, you're likely to respond with a sarcastic \"No duh!\" or \"Thanks Sherlock.\" If obvious isn't the obvious word of choice, you can try a synonym such as \"evident\" or \"apparent.\""

  "inveigh": {
    "short": "Picture an old man banging his fist on the dinner table, inveighing against the evils of teenagers being allowed to listen to music and dance. Inveigh means to rail against something with hostility and passion.",
    "long": "Related to vehicle, inveigh comes from Latin in- + vehere \"to carry.\" During the Vietnam War, war protesters held rallies where young men burned their draft cards and inveighed against the imperialist motives by which our country was being driven and the war's escalation without its ever being properly authorized in Congress."

  "proposition": {
    "short": "A proposition is a proposed plan of action, a detailed suggestion. You might consider your friend's suggestion to set up a neighborhood snow-shoveling business after the blizzard a winning proposition.",
    "long": "The noun proposition means something presented for consideration. In some contexts, that something being offered is sexual. Therefore, don't use the term proposition loosely. If you say that you made a proposition to your teacher, people could misinterpret you. It's safer to stick with suggestion."

  "mundane": {
    "short": "An ordinary, unexciting thing can be called mundane: \"Superman hid his heroic feats by posing as his mundane alter ego, Clark Kent.\"",
    "long": "Mundane, from the Latin word mundus, \"world,\" originally referred to things on earth. Such things were supposed to be uninteresting when compared to the delights of Heaven; hence the word's present meaning. Writing about reality TV shows, a Newsweek writer opined, \"In reality bizarro-world, the mundane is presented as the spectacular\" — in other words, people's everyday routines are now televised as entertainment."
  },
  "spurn": {
    "short": "If you reject your mother's offer to buy you a pair of lederhosen with a snort and eye roll, you are spurning her generosity. To spurn means to reject with disdain.",
    "long": "Originally, to spurn was to kick away. Though it's not used in that context so often anymore, being spurned still feels like a kick in the gut. You can reject someone kindly, or let them down easily, but you can't spurn someone with anything but malice."
  },
  "repartee": {
    "short": "Late night talk show hosts are known for being experts at repartee, or clever conversation, with their celebrity guests.",
    "long": "Repartee comes from the French word repartire, which is a fencing term meaning \"an answering thrust with a sword.\" When you are engaging in repartee, you don't literally stab someone, but you come back with a quick verbal blow. Most of us aren't as quick as we'd like to be. Mark Twain defined repartee as, \"something we think of 24 hours too late.\""
  },
  "loll": {
    "short": "To loll means to hang around lazily without doing much at all. It's a great pleasure to loll about in the park instead of going to work. But your boss might have a problem with it.",
    "long": "Loll means to droop, or hang loosely. We usually use it to describe the behavior of hanging loosely, like lolling about on the beach reading a book. Sometimes it’s the perfect word for a drooping object. If you take your dog for a long run in the hot sun, its tongue will loll out of its mouth. If you fall asleep on the bus ride home, your head might loll onto your neighbor’s shoulder."

  "convoke": {
    "short": "To convoke is to call to a meeting, especially a formal meeting. When planning military strategy, a nation's leader might convoke her trusted advisors and top generals.",
    "long": "Convoke emerged in the 14th century, from the Latin word  convocare — \"to call together;\" the definition stands today unchanged. Use convoke when you are speaking of people or a group being summoned for an official gathering, like the kind the government or a large organization holds."

  "inherit": {
    "short": "When your grandmother dies, you might inherit her tea set. Regardless of her death, you might inherit her sense of humor or rather large nose. To inherit is to receive from a predecessor.",
    "long": "When you are talking about property, inherit is always used to describe something you get after someone else has died. However, there doesn't have to be a death involved to use the word inherit. When you start a new job, you might inherit less than pleasant tasks from the person who had the job before you. You might also quickly inherit their desire to find a new place to work."

  "connive": {
    "short": "To connive is to plan or plot to do something illegal or wrong. Conniving is considered dishonest and cowardly.",
    "long": "If someone accuses you of conniving, that's definitely not a compliment. Conniving usually occurs in secret, and people who connive are up to no good. Criminals planning a bank robbery are conniving. Crooked politicians looking for a bribe are conniving. Villains connive, and conniving is associated with conspiracies and dishonesty. The opposite of conniving is being honest and straightforward."

  "penchant": {
    "short": "A penchant is a strong preference or tendency. If you have a penchant for pizza, you either eat it daily or wish you did.",
    "long": "Penchant borrows from French, in which penchant literally means inclined. It goes back to the Latin pendere, for hanging, which is also the source of pendant. In both French and English, speakers have long used the idea of inclination metaphorically: a hillside can be inclined in one direction or another, and so can a person's thoughts. But in English, penchant is only for desires."

  "prudent": {
    "short": "Describe an action as prudent if it is the wise thing to do under the existing circumstances. If you're getting in trouble, it is probably prudent to keep your mouth closed and just listen.",
    "long": "If you show good and careful judgment when handling practical matters, you can be described as prudent. Similarly, a wise and well-thought-through decision or action can be called prudent. The word comes from a contracted form of the Latin prōvidēns, from the verb \"to foresee.\" The English word provident, \"wise in planning for the future,\" is the non-contracted descendent of the same Latin root."
  },
  "droll": {
    "short": "Need a mental picture for the word droll? Think of one of those cute-homely troll dolls — blend those two words together — \"doll\" and \"troll\" — and you get droll, a description of a figure that is adorably strange and whimsically cute.",
    "long": "The word droll comes from the archaic French word drolle, referring to a jolly good fellow.

It's a word that shows up in the headlines often, as a country might denounce a corrupt election. Politicians love to denounce the shady behavior or their opponents. Denounce can also mean the official end of something, like a treaty."

    "long": "To assault is to attack or bombard someone in some way. Fighter planes can make an aerial assault, while ground troops make a ground assault. Verbal assault consists of insults, swearing, or threats. A strong criticism, like a negative review in the newspaper, is a written assault.

    "long": "Effulgence is brightness taken to the extreme. You may be dazzled by it, stunned by it, or even overcome by it. Usually used to refer to the sun or some other mega-star, effulgence can also be used more figuratively. If you're met with the mega-watt effulgence of the most beautiful movie star, take a moment to marvel at the rays of light shooting from her perfect smile. Then snap out of it and ask for an autograph."

    "long": "If someone says, \"Let me expedite the process,\" that's probably a good thing: they're offering to speed things up. If you've ever waited in line a long time, then you must have wished someone could expedite things. A driver can expedite his commute by going in the faster car-pool lane. Whenever there's a lot of paperwork for something, it's nice to know someone who can expedite the process. When you see the word expedite, think \"Make faster!\""

    "long": "Some standardized tests still have \"analogy questions,\" which are given in this format: A : B :: C : ___ (read \"A is to B as C is to what?\"). This is a more formalized version of something we do every day: compare one thing to another. It's a useful way of speaking — if a scientist explains that the earth's forests function as its lungs, we understand  the analogy to mean that both trees and lungs take in important elements from the air. But when Forrest Gump says life is like a box of chocolates because you never know what you're going to get, that's a pretty brainless analogy."

  "amnesty": {
    "short": "Amnesty can mean a pardon for a wrongdoing, or it can also signal a government's willingness to overlook something.",
    "long": "Amnesty sounds a little like \"amnesia,\" and that's because in its more specific sense amnesty means \"forgetting.\" The government will essentially forget about whatever crime was committed, or whatever horrible things were said. As part of a truce, amnesty can be granted to opposition forces in civil disputes. Amnesty to illegal aliens means the government will deliberately overlook their illegal entry to the country. There can also be a period of amnesty when people can turn in something that they would otherwise get in trouble for. \"The city offered a period of amnesty for everyone to turn in illegal guns.\""

One of the best ways to invigorate another person is with your own enthusiasm — when you're animated and energetic, it seems to rub off on others. You might need to invigorate yourself when you first wake up in the morning, with a cup of coffee or a shower to get you going for the day. The word invigorate comes from the Latin in, \"toward\" and vigorare \"make strong.\""

    "short": "The adjective blithe used to mean happy and carefree, but over time it has also come to describe someone who isn't paying attention the way they should.",
    "long": "If you have a blithe disregard for authority, you might just smile vaguely when a teacher is yelling at you and continue writing on the lockers with a Sharpie. If you're dancing to music while driving, and pass blithely through a red light, chances are you will be pulled over and given either a ticket or a lecture."

    "short": "Something that has inerrancy is completely accurate and cannot be wrong. Many Christians believe in the inerrancy of the Bible.",
    "long": "You're most likely to come across the noun inerrancy in a religious context. It usually describes Christian religious writing — particularly the Bible — and the word of God. People who believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible are most likely to emphasize its inerrancy. In other words, they think that everything in the Bible is the literal truth. Inerrancy comes from inerrant, which originally referred to stars in the sky, and which is rooted in inerrantem, \"not wandering\" in Latin."

  "solecism": {
    "short": "Ever snore at the opera? Burp at the dinner table? Forget your mom's birthday? Probably all three, right? Well, don't worry. Instead of just screwing up, what you did was commit a solecism. Sounds kinda neat that way, huh?",
    "long": "The origin of solecism comes from the ancient Greek word meaning \"speaking incorrectly,\" and solecism does have another meaning that's more specifically verbal. If you say something incorrectly, or make a grammatical error in writing, that's also a solecism. It can be just as mortifying as burping at the dinner table. Well, almost."

    "long": "Opal is a beautiful mineral with an almost magical, layered reflective quality that catches the eye the way a pearl does. Something opalescent has that same reflective quality. High-quality guitars, for example, often have opalescent inlays in the fingerboard that are not only beautiful but also useful. They can help the guitar player find her way around the instrument. Don't be fooled by imitations! Many fake jewels have an opalescent quality that mimics real pearl, but it's plastic, all the same."

    "long": "Imposture comes from the verb,  to impose, and it has the sense of deliberately deceiving someone. Someone who perpetrates an imposture is an imposter. If you go to a job interview and pretend that you graduated from Harvard when really you never even went to college, that is an act of imposture. If the interviewer finds out, she might disgustedly say to you, “Get out, you imposter!”"

    "long": "The distant ancestors of frown, the ones that came long before Old French, meant \"nose.\" Think about the expression, to look down one's nose at someone or something, which means \"to disapprove of.\" If you have a frown on your face, you definitely don't like what you see!

    "short": "The word \"bell\" shows up in the middle of embellish, and bells are something that decorate, or embellish something, making it more attractive. If you embellish speech, though, it can get ugly if you add a lot of details that aren't true.",
    "long": "Embellish often has the positive meaning of adding something to make it more handsome or beautifully decorated. But, while adding bells to something looks great at first, after a couple of hours of bells ringing in the ears, what was meant to embellish and beautify can get annoying. That's what can happen when you embellish by adding too many false or exaggerated details to a story. Embellishing with true, colorful details and vivid descriptions is what can really enhance the beauty of a story."

  "lambaste": {
    "short": "To lambaste is to reprimand or berate someone severely. People lambaste those who have angered or disappointed them.",
    "long": "Have you ever watched a basketball game and noticed a coach yelling like a maniac at a referee? That coach is lambasting the referee. Lambasting is also called chewing out, taking to task, scolding, reprimanding, berating, bawling out, and chiding. Parents lambaste disobedient kids. A boss might lambaste a worker who is late all the time. Lambasting is severe and goes way beyond criticizing. When you are lambasting, you are furious at someone and letting them know it."

  "dilute": {
    "short": "When you dilute something, you make it thinner, weaker, or more watered down. If you put lots of ice cubes in your soda, the ice will melt and dilute the drink.",
    "long": "Think about diluting as lessening the quality but increasing the quantity. Unless you're diluting a really strong drink to make it taste better or diluting heavy paint to get a lighter shade — then the quality actually improves. Quipped President John F. Kennedy, “Public speaking is the art of diluting a two-minute idea with a two-hour vocabulary.”"
  },
  "protracted": {
    "short": "Something protracted has been drawn out, usually in a tedious way. Protracted things are long and seem like they're never going to end.",
    "long": "Anything protracted is lasting longer than you would like. A speech that seems to go on forever is protracted. If an employer and a union can't reach an agreement, there could be a protracted strike. Before a movie, the previews are almost always protracted — they never seem to stop. If something is long and annoying, and there's no good reason it couldn't be shorter, it's protracted."
  },
  "rapprochement": {
    "short": "Rapprochement is the reestablishment of a happy relationship or arrangement. A peace treaty between warring nations is a kind of rapprochement.",
    "long": "People who usually get along sometimes come into conflict: formerly allied nations go to war, friends feud, and spouses divorce. If a conflict ends and the parties go back to being on good terms, they achieve rapprochement. This term is most often used in international politics — for example, when two countries make peace after a long war, that's rapprochement. The word means \"reunion\" or \"reconciliation\" in French, and its root is rapprocher, \"to bring near.\""
  },
  "sacrosanct": {
    "short": "You might be enraged at the idea of doing homework on a Saturday if you consider your weekends sacrosanct — meaning they are too special or important to interrupt.",
    "long": "Sacrosanct is often used to describe religious rituals and traditions, which isn’t surprising considering that this adjective comes from the Latin word for something that is protected by a religious sanction. A church, for example, might consider its Sunday service to be sacrosanct — a very important and holy ritual that cannot be changed or canceled. It’s a bad idea to criticize or change any custom or tradition that people consider sacrosanct — they won’t be happy about it."
  },
  "dither": {
    "short": "When you dither, you're flustered because you can't make up your mind about something. You might dither about what to do if your two best friends invite you to parties on the same night.",
    "long": "The verb dither implies not only that you're having a hard time deciding about something, but that you're upset or agitated about it. You might say to your friend, \"Don't just pace around and dither about what to wear! We're going to be late!\" In the 17th century, dither meant \"quake or tremble,\" and by the early 1800s it came to mean both \"vacillate\" and \"be anxious.\""

  "blase": {
    "short": "If the thrill is gone, you are blasé. If you yawn on a roller coaster, then maybe you've had one too many rides.",
    "long": "The adjective blase (most often spelled blasé), describes someone who is bored with the pleasures of life because of frequent indulgence or exposure. When asked what she thought of the award ceremony, the actress yawned and replied, \"It was blasé. It was just like the last 15 award ceremonies I had attended.\""
  },
  "affluent": {
    "short": "You know you're driving through an affluent neighborhood when you see large houses, perfect landscaping, and expensive cars. Use affluent to describe wealthy people or areas.",
    "long": "In Middle English, affluent meant \"abundant, flowing,\" from Old French, from Latin affluēns, from affluere \"to abound in,\" from the prefix ad- \"to, at\" plus fluere \"to flow.\" The meaning of \"abundant, flowing\" is still seen in phrases such as \"affluent prose.\" But mostly, when you use the word affluent, the thing understood to be flowing is cash."
  },
  "sarcastic": {
    "short": "Sarcastic humor mocks or ridicules, usually by saying the opposite of what is actually meant. The talent-show judge who rolls his eyes at your dancing, smirks, and says, \"You ought to be on Broadway\" is a sarcastic person.",
    "long": "Sarcastic comes from the Greek word sarkazhein, which literally means \"tear the flesh.\" Maybe that's why we also refer to our talent-show judge's remark as \"cutting.\" When someone's being sarcastic, sometimes it's the tone, facial expression, or body language that let you know — like when our talent-show judge says exaggeratedly, \"Great job! I almost confused you for Pavarotti,\" as he gives you a thumbs-down."
  },
  "abstain": {
    "short": "If you abstain from something, you restrain yourself from consuming it. People usually abstain from things that are considered vices — like eating French fries every day for lunch.",
    "long": "Roots of the word abstain are from the 14th-century French, \"to withhold oneself,\" and the word often refers to people who hold themselves back from indulging in habits that are bad for them, physically or morally. Abstain can also mean to withhold a vote, and sometimes a difficult decision is stalled when government representatives abstain from voting one way or another."
  },
  "uphold": {
    "short": "When you uphold something, you stick up for or support it. Police officers are paid to uphold the law, and crazy Elvis fans uphold their belief that he's still alive out there somewhere.",
    "long": "If you reverse the two parts of this word, you get hold up. And that's exactly what upholding is: holding up or supporting an idea or practice. You might uphold your dog's innocence, even though it's pretty obvious he dug up the neighbor's flower bed. When America fought for independence, we upheld the idea of fair representation. When you uphold something, you're taking a stand for it."
  },
  "impending": {
    "short": "If something is impending, it is about to happen. If you hear thunder in the distance, you might go inside to escape the impending storm.",
    "long": "The word impending often refers to something threatening or frightening: impending doom, impending disaster. Something that is impending hangs over you — you might say, \"I was so distracted by thoughts of my impending failure in my exams, I couldn't study.\" A synonym is imminent."
  },
  "ubiquitous": {
    "short": "It's everywhere! It's everywhere! When something seems like it's present in all places at the same time, reach for the adjective ubiquitous.",
    "long": "\"Cities like Singapore aim to cloak themselves in ubiquitous, free Wi-Fi in the next few years,\" The Wall Street Journal reported recently — meaning that those savvy Singaporeans will find a wireless connection everywhere they go. The word comes from the Latin ubique, meaning — you guessed it — \"everywhere.\" The usual pronunciation is \"yoo-BIK-wih-tihs,\" but Joseph Heller must have had the older variant \"ooh-BIK-wih-tihs\" in mind when he wrote in Catch-22 that a character \"padded through the shadows fruitlessly like an ubiquitous spook.\""

    "long": "The verb assess has the general meaning of determining the importance or value of something. It also has a few specialized uses having to do with amounts of money, such as fines, fees, and taxes. It can mean to set the value of property for purposes of taxation, or to charge a person or business a tax or fee. Assess comes from Anglo-French usage, and is ultimately derived from the Latin verb assidēre, \"to sit as a judge.\""

  "knotty": {
    "short": "Whether it’s pine or problems, sometimes the word knotty can apply to both. Knotty can describe something that has a lot of knots, either literally or figuratively.",
    "long": "The adjective knotty is a way to describe something that’s covered in knots. It can be used in a literal sense to refer to wood that is covered in hard, irregular knots — you’ve probably seen these circular, knobby imperfections that sometime appear on wood. The word can also be used figuratively to describe something that is intricate and difficult to solve, such as a knotty political problem involving two warring nations or a knotty legal issue involving complicated constitutional issues."
  },
  "apostate": {
    "short": "An apostate is someone who has deserted his cause.",
    "long": "The word apostate originally comes from a Greek word that meant \"runaway slave.\" Now, apostate has a religious or political tone to it, so someone might call you \"a political apostate\" if you ran for office as a Republican during one election and then ran as a Democrat in the following election."
  },
  "icon": {
    "short": "An icon is a symbol. It can be literal—–like the little trashcan on your computer screen—–or metaphorical––as in a singer so well known by ten-year-olds, he's called a pre-teen pop icon.",
    "long": "Icon comes to us from the Greek word eikenai, meaning \"to seem or to be like.\" In certain religions, statues of religious figures are referred to as icons––because they are prayed to as if they were the thing they represent. Icon can also describe a person closely linked to an idea. Mahatma Gandhi is revered as an icon of peace and humanity, while Adolf Hitler is reviled as an icon of violence and hatred."
  },
  "antiquated": {
    "short": "Something is antiquated when it is so old that it is no longer useful. If your parents believe that you shouldn't use the Internet when you write papers for school, you might call their ideas antiquated.",
    "long": "Something is antiquated when it is so old, it's like an antique or recognizable from another era and has the negative feel of being thoroughly outmoded. Things like typewriters, sealing wax for letters, and ideas of proper etiquette all seem antiquated in modern society. Currently, things get antiquated ever faster — 5-inch floppy disks for computers and dial-up modems were very modern fifteen years ago, but now they're antiquated."
  },
  "forestall": {
    "short": "It takes a bit of planning to forestall something, meaning stop it from happening. To forestall the effects of aging, exercise and take care of your health all your life.",
    "long": "You can break the word forestall into parts to figure out its meaning. The prefix fore is one you've seen in words like forewarn, which means \"to warn in advance.\" And you probably know that stall means \"delay.\" So to forestall is to stall in advance, or put another way, to try to prevent or put off something you don't want to happen."
  },
  "amenable": {
    "short": "If your friends want to try sky diving and you're amenable to the idea, sounds like you're going to be jumping out of a plane. If a person or thing is amenable to something, they are ready, willing, or responsive.",
    "long": "Note that amenable is often followed by the preposition to, which makes amenable mean \"able to be controlled or affected by something,\" as in: \"They are usually amenable to our wishes\" or \"Her heart condition is not amenable to treatment.\" An amenable personality is open to influence or control and is willing to agree or yield."

  "diminutive": {
    "short": "Diminutive means small. A diminutive person is short and small. A  diminutive  word is a \"cute\" version of a word or name:  for example, \"duckling\" is a  diminutive  of \"duck\" and Billy is a  diminutive  form of the name William.",
    "long": "A diminutive name or word is formed from another by the addition of a suffix expressing smallness in size: a booklet is a small book, and a dinette is a small version of a dining set. The adjective diminutive descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Late Latin dīminūtīvus, from Latin dēminuere, \"to lessen.\""
  },
  "knave": {
    "short": "You don't hear about knaves much these days: it's an older word for a rascal, a scoundrel, or a rogue. It isn't a compliment.",
    "long": "If you read Shakespeare for long, you'll definitely see the word knave more than once. In Shakespeare, an important person like a king or a prince might call a thief a knave. Knaves always tend to be up to trouble. You don't want to trust a knave; knaves lie, deceive, and betray. Today, we might call a knave a \"scoundrel\" or a \"good-for-nothing.\""

    "long": "It's not nice to call someone a nitwit, but it's hard to resist when people do things that are outrageously incompetent or ridiculous. It's pretty common to refer to entire groups of people as nitwits, like politicians or fans of a rival sports team. The word comes from nit, \"nothing\" in dialectical Yiddish, and wit, \"sense or intelligence.\""

  "dormitory": {
    "short": "A dormitory is a building at a boarding school, college, or university where students live. Many students have roommates in a dormitory, and sometimes those roommates put up really cheesy posters of shirtless guys leaning on cars.",
    "long": "The word dormitory is from the Latin dormitorium for \"sleeping place,\" and if you keep going back you get to dormire for \"to sleep.\" A dormitory is where students who live at school sleep — well, it’s where their beds are anyway. Often the first time kids sleep away at school is when they go to college. \r\nThere are often different dorms for freshman and older students. Dormitories are also called dorms, residence halls, and student residences."

  "beleaguer": {
    "short": "Beleaguer means to pester or badger with persistence. A babysitter might find annoying the children who beleaguer her with requests for candy, cookies, games, and piggyback rides all at the same time.",
    "long": "Beleaguer originally meant to lay siege to, and originates from a 16th century Dutch term which meant to camp all around. It was not until later that beleaguer came to mean harass or bother in a determined way. Remember that there is a league in the middle of be-league-r and the spelling will be easy."
  },
  "lackluster": {
    "short": "Lackluster is a compound adjective that means what it sounds like: if something is lackluster it lacks luster; in other words, it is without brilliance, shine, or vitality. Think dull.",
    "long": "Shakespeare gave us the compound lackluster, first using the term in his play As You Like It. In 2:7, the character Jacques says, \"And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye...\" Since Shakespeare first coined this word, it has been used to describe anything \"blah\"; lackluster sales would worry shop owners and a lackluster prom dress might help you blend in with the wallpaper."

  "jury": {
    "short": "A jury is a group that decides a contest or a court case together. If you get summoned for jury duty and get picked as one of the 12 members of the jury, you’ll help decide if someone is guilty or not.",
    "long": "A jury is any group that makes a group decision. In the County Fair, the stakes aren't so high — just respect for your baking skills or pig-raising talents. But many juries are convened by courts to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty. In this case, the jury is sworn to act according to the law. Jury comes from the Old French word for \"oath,\" pointing to the promise to deliver the truth that a jury swears to."

  "erase": {
    "short": "When you erase something, you eliminate or delete it, often by physically wiping it out. It's easy to erase chalk from a blackboard, but not so easy to erase graffiti from the side of a building.",
    "long": "There are several ways to erase: you can erase a pencil mark with an eraser; you can digitally erase information on your computer or recording device; and you can figuratively erase something by removing all evidence of it. Peaceful people hope to erase war from the earth, for example — to take away every last trace of it. The Latin root eradere means \"scrape out.\""
  },
  "artless": {
    "short": "Yes, artless could mean lacking in art, but more often it means lacking in superficiality or deceit. An artless person could never make a living as a con artist.",
    "long": "Originally meaning \"unskillful\" or \"uncultured,\" artless evolved into meaning not skilled or cultured in the art of deceit. If you are artless, you are natural and uncontrived. Young people, animals, the socially inept — these can all be artless in the way they express themselves. They seem to mean exactly what they say."

    "long": "We change the pronunciation of this noun (\"PRED-uh-kit\") when we turn it into a verb (\"PRED-uh-kate\"). The verb predicate means to require something as a condition of something else, and we use this term mostly in connection with logic, mathematics, or rhetoric. To predicate your argument on certain facts is to use those facts as evidence."
  },
  "panegyric": {
    "short": "A formal, high-minded speech can be described with a formal, high-minded word — the word panegyric, which is a very elaborate tribute to someone. You could consider most eulogies as panegyrics.",
    "long": "It stands to reason that the original use of the word panegyris, from which panegyric derives, was to describe a public gathering in honor of a Greek god. The Latin, L. panegyricus, altered slightly to mean \"public eulogy,\" which around the 16th Century shifted to the French panégyrique, which meant \"laudation.\" In any case, the word today stands for high praise given in a speech or tribute as highfalutin as the word itself sounds."

    "long": "You discredit what someone says when you choose not to believe it. You can discredit the rumors going around about your boyfriend if you are sure of his love. On a more personal level, you discredit people when you cast their authority or reputation into doubt. If you're running a tough race for class president, your opponent may try to discredit you by talking about your failures or even making up lies about you. But this would be to the discredit of your opponent — his or her own reputation would suffer for this bad behavior."

  "recumbent": {
    "short": "Bikes on which you recline rather than sit upright are recumbent. Recumbent means leaning back in a reclining position.",
    "long": "Recumbent starts like recline, which is an easy way to remember it. Your dad's position in his favorite La-Z-Boy reclining chair? Recumbent. Your position when you lay back on lounge chair at the pool? Also recumbent — and in both cases, these are both positions of comfort."

  "asperity": {

    "long": "If you've studied Spanish, you know that the verb pensar means \"to think.\" If you're pensive, you might simply be thinking hard about something.

    "long": "Consign means to commit or relegate. Those platform shoes you still have from high school in the 1970s? You should probably consign them to the trash — of course, they probably should have been consigned in the 1970s! Consign can also be used if you turn over an object for sale where the business making the sale gets a percentage of the profits and so do you. If you don't like the art work you inherited, you might consign it with an auction house and use the profits to buy something you like better."
  },
  "asinine": {
    "short": "Anything that's asinine is truly stupid or foolish. Your brother might love a ridiculous reality TV show, while you find it completely asinine.",
    "long": "Asinine derives from the Latin asinus, which means \"stupid,\" but also \"like an ass or donkey.\" Asinine behavior isn't simply dumb, but is as obstinate and lacking in judgement as a stubborn donkey. It would be foolish if your friend spray-painted graffiti on the neighbor's garage door, but it would be asinine if he also signed his name."

    "long": "If you deliberately break a rule or ignore an order, you defy, or resist, that rule. The word defy comes from the Latin word disfidare for \"renounce one's faith.\" So if you're expected to be faithful to a certain law or rule but you refuse to be, you defy it.

  "precipitous": {

Now imagine how you'd feel standing at the edge peering over, and you'll grasp the sense of impending danger that precipitous tends to imply. Precipitous declines in sales lead to bankruptcy. Precipitous mountainside hiking trails are not for the acrophobic. It can describe an ascent, but precipitous is most often used for things going literally or figuratively downhill."

He says, \"Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?

    "long": "Stratum comes from the Latin meaning \"something that has been laid down,\" like asphalt or a bedsheet, but we generally use it to describe layers of something. If you go into geology, you will probably investigate different strata of the soil. If you start out in life poor and try to become rich, you are trying to get into a different social stratum."

    "short": "An adage is a saying. Moms and dads love adages such as \"early to bed, early to rise\" and \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away.\"",
    "long": "The noun adage comes from the Latin root aio, meaning \"I say.\" Like a proverb, an adage can be true or not so much. It's a folksy saying that's been passed around for so long that it doesn't even matter if it's true anymore. Adages can be wise and wisecracking, such as this quote from Alice Roosevelt Longworth: \"I've always believed in the adage that the secret of eternal youth is arrested development.\" There's a Book of Proverbs in the Bible, but adages can show up anywhere, even cross-stitched on a pillow."

  "speculative": {
    "short": "Speculative describes very risky and unproven ideas or chances. You might have great ideas about starting your own business but your plans are speculative until you earn money from them.",
    "long": "Speculative describes abstract ideas — usually with high risk — that often come with excitement and expectation too. A speculative investment could mean putting lots of cash into a business or real estate property hoping it will make money later. Anything speculative is based on prediction: whatever it is hasn't happened yet."
  },
  "recede": {
    "short": "Recede means to pull back, retreat, or become faint or distant. Flood waters recede, as do glaciers, and even abstractions like \"panic\" and \"hope.\" Think \"receding hairline.\" (That means bald.)",
    "long": "Cede means \"to yield.\" Politicians, after losing an election will \"cede the field\" or \"concede the race.\" Recede means to yield back. Over time, this word has taken on the sense of fading or growing faint, as in \"The ghostly vision of a woman receded into the fog.\""
  },
  "levee": {
    "short": "A levee is an embankment, like a dam, constructed to prevent the overflow of a body of water. It can also mean a formal reception. How do these two words relate? Read on...",
    "long": "In French, lever means to lift and se lever means to rise, literally \"lift yourself.\" When the king rose from his bed and received visitors, that was a levee. When you raise up dirt or other materials to build a dam or levee, that's also a levee. Now, official levees don't involve kings––but you might hear of “a governor’s levee at the state capital.” And levee can be used as a verb, meaning to make an embankment, or shore up."
  },
  "uproar": {
    "short": "Any kind of noisy disturbance can be called an uproar. A large group of political protesters outside City Hall is likely to create an uproar.",
    "long": "There's often an uproar in the audience of a rock concert when the band first appears on stage — people cheer and applaud and whistle. An announcement that the neighborhood donut shop is out of donuts could create another kind of uproar, especially if people have been standing in a long line dreaming of crullers and chocolate glazed donuts. Uproar comes from the German Aufruhr, \"a stirring up.\""
  },
  "diffident": {
    "short": "The adjective diffident describes someone who is shy and lacking in self-confidence. If you are shy and have a diffident manner, you should probably not choose one of these professions: substitute teacher, stand-up comic, or lion-tamer.",
    "long": "Diffident can describe someone who is reserved and restrained. Some may mistake your diffident manner for coolness or aloofness. Although it may be in your nature to be diffident, you will find it impossible to remain so when you visit my family. They are a big, noisy, outgoing bunch and they will make you join in the fun until you let loose and open up. Don't say you weren't warned!"
  },
  "exasperate": {
    "short": "To exasperate someone is to annoy him or her to the point of impatience, frustration and irritation, like when you exasperate a busy waiter by asking questions like \"what are all the ingredients in the salad dressing?\" and making him repeat the specials five times.",
    "long": "The verb exasperate comes from the Latin word exasperatus, which means “to roughen,” “irritate,” or “provoke.” To exasperate is to make something that is already bad even worse, like when sitting in traffic that is sure to make you late, you exasperate the person who is driving by bringing up an unpleasant topic, or the addition of twenty more students that exasperates the crowding in the cafeteria."
  },
  "panache": {
    "short": "To have panache is to have a stylish flair. You might wear your giant polka-dotted scarf with great panache.",
    "long": "Panache comes from the Latin word pinnaculum, which means “small wing” or “tuft of feathers.” When you decorate yourself with a flourish, have an elegant appearance, or do something with style, you are said to have panache. You might wear your beret with new-found panache. Your aunt Milly may throw a party with unmatched panache. Or your brother's ability to turn a phrase may show an uncommon panache."
  },
  "compulsory": {
    "short": "When something is compulsory, it is required or must be done. In most states, it's compulsory for kids to attend school (or an equivalent homeschool) from age six to seventeen.",
    "long": "This adjective is from Medieval Latin compulsorius, \"using force,\" from Classical Latin compellere, \"to force.\" The Latin suffix –orius corresponds to English -ory, \"containing or involving.\" Other English words descended from the same Latin verb are compel and compulsive."
  },
  "reprobate": {
    "short": "There's no way around it, a reprobate is a bad egg. The black sheep of the family, missing a moral compass — a reprobate's been called everything from a deviant to an evildoer to a scoundrel.",
    "long": "Selfish, depraved, disreputable, a reprobate is not known for his inner goodness. In fact, reprobates were once considered \"rejected by God,\" the meaning of the noun in the 1500s. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, a reprobate was a popular literary character, sometimes amusing, as noted in Henry James' Daisy Miller, \"What a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played an injured innocence!\""
  },
  "maneuver": {
    "short": "You maneuver your way through a crowd, a bureaucracy, traffic, or traffic cones. You can maneuver a car or a piece of machinery. Army maneuvers are highly coordinated movements of troops, supplies and machinery.",
    "long": "If you're wondering if the opposite of maneuver is woman-euver, wonder no further. It isn't. Although maneuvering often involves a man on the move, the man- comes from the Latin manus meaning \"hand.\" Maneuver reached English via the French manœuvre meaning \"tactical movement\" — an interesting maneuver in its own right."
  },
  "cavil": {
    "short": "If your only cavil to your family's trip to Disney World is that you don't like airline food, you're not representing the anti-Mickey side of the argument very well. A cavil is a small or petty objection.",
    "long": "Cavil is not a word that comes up all that often. You can replace it with the more commonly used word  quibble and still have the same meaning. If you cavil over a restaurant bill, you argue about the minute, unimportant details of who owes what — like whether your portion of the bill is $10.00 or $10.17."
  },
  "upbraid": {
    "short": "No, upbraid isn’t an elaborate hairdo. When you upbraid people, you scold them, tell them off, and criticize them. (You could, however, upbraid your stylist after a bad haircut.)",
    "long": "The word upbraid comes from the Old English word upbregdan, which literally means \"bring up quickly.\"  Although this word doesn't have anything to do with hair, upbraid and braid are, in fact, related.  The original meaning of braid was \"to move quickly from side to side,\" which is what you do with your fingers when you're braiding someone's hair.  When you upbraid someone, you're quickly bringing up different reasons why you're mad at them."
  },
  "divert": {
    "short": "To divert means to shift or turn from one thing to another. A magician might attempt to divert your attention as he shoves the rabbit into the hat.",
    "long": "The police will divert traffic if there has been an accident that blocks the road, and it's a good idea to divert some of your income into a savings account so you don't spend it all. Are you throwing a surprise party for a friend at his house? Have a neighbor divert him for a little while if he comes home early so that you can finish getting ready. While these uses concern physically guiding something to a different location, divert can also be used to mean \"distract\" or \"entertain.\" If your friend can't stop worrying about her grades, you might want to divert her with the latest school gossip."
  },
  "languid": {
    "short": "Describe a slow-moving river or a weak breeze or a listless manner with the slightly poetic adjective, languid.",
    "long": "Languid comes from the Latin verb, languere \"to be weak or faint\" and is a somewhat literary word for something that doesn't use much energy. If someone says goodbye to you with a languid wave of the hand, there's not too much movement involved. You can describe yourself as languid when you have that feeling of not being entirely awake —  kind of lazy in the mind."
  },
  "inextricable": {
    "short": "A chain that is very badly knotted and cannot be unraveled is inextricable. You cannot disentangle it.",
    "long": "Inextricable comes from the Latin prefix in- meaning \"not\" and extricare meaning \"unravel.\" Something that is inextricable cannot be unraveled. This isn't just limited to objects. Memories from childhood can sometimes be inextricable from other associations — so bound up that it is hard to separate one from the other."
  },
  "cavalry": {
    "short": "A cavalry is a group of soldiers who fight on horses. Cavalry can also refer to any military unit that is quick and mobile.",
    "long": "If a general said, \"Send in the cavalry!\" you can be sure a group of soldiers are being called upon. The only question is whether the cavalry is the traditional sort or if the word is being used more loosely. Traditionally, a cavalry is a unit of troops on horseback. When horses were a primary means of transportation, cavalries were a common part of war. Since then, a cavalry might be any unit of soldiers that can be quickly deployed."
  },
  "fanatical": {
    "short": "If you are excessively enthusiastic about something — a sports team, an actor, your religion, saving the whales, a certain brand of chocolate — then you are fanatical about it.",
    "long": "Fanatical comes from the word fanatic, which itself came from the Latin fanaticus, meaning \"mad\" or \"inspired by a deity.\" The root word is fanum, or \"temple.\" The original English meanings of both fanatic and fanatical implied that the person being described was insane with enthusiasm, like a religious zealot. The word fan is likely shortened from fanatic, and thus shares the same roots, but that word doesn't imply the same obsessiveness that fanatical does."
  },
  "obsolescent": {
    "short": "Recycling bins, garbage dumps, and junkyards are filled with obsolescent stuff — computers, televisions, cars, and everything else that's discarded because it's not the latest thing anymore.",
    "long": "The word obsolescent is closely related to obsolete and the words are often used interchangeably. Actually, though, the -sc- in obsolescent means \"becoming.\" So, if you're going to use the word carefully, you can talk about your obsolescent computer that still lumbers along but will soon be obsolete and completely useless."
  },
  "contemplate": {
    "short": "Before you accept a job offer, or a college's offer of admission, you should take time to contemplate the pros and cons of your decision. If you contemplate something, you think about it carefully.",
    "long": "Contemplate is from Latin contemplatus, past participle of contemplari \"to gaze attentively, observe,\" from the prefix com- \"together\" plus templum \"temple.\" The original meaning of Latin contemplari was \"to mark out a space for observing auguries or omens,\" and the temple was a holy space reserved for this purpose."
  },
  "sanguine": {
    "short": "If you're sanguine about a situation, that means you're optimistic that everything's going to work out fine.",
    "long": "Sanguine is from Latin sanguis \"blood\" and originally meant \"bloody\" — in medieval medicine it described someone whose ruddy complexion was a sign of an optimistic outlook. That was back when people thought that \"bodily humors\" like blood were responsible for your attitudes. Now that we no longer believe in humors, sanguine has settled down as a fancy way to say someone is cheerfully confident.  Experts are frequently described as feeling sanguine about a political or economic situation — or not sanguine, if they think we're going to hell in a handbasket."
  },
  "condescending": {
    "short": "If you are being condescending, you are looking down on someone. A 10-year-old who says to his sibling, \"What do you know? You're only a 6-year-old!\" is being condescending.",
    "long": "The Latin prefix con- means \"with,\" and the Latin word for descend means \"down,\" so the word condescending probably developed to describe someone who looked down on others. Condescending behavior is, not surprisingly, itself looked down upon. It's usually intended to make people feel bad about not knowing or having something, and it very often works."
  },
  "prove": {
    "short": "When you prove something, you show that it's true. If you say you love eating raw eggs, you may have to prove it by chugging a few. When someone asks you to prove something, you need evidence, also known as proof.",
    "long": "Prove comes from the Latin root probare, \"to test or prove worthy.\" The word’s meaning is clear in this quote from writer Ernest Holmes: \"There was a time when a man was so convinced that the world was round that he was determined to prove it.\" As a transitive verb, prove requires an object to receive the action, as in \"How can you prove your claim?\" It can also be intransitive, as in \"You might prove to be right.\""
  },
  "obtuse": {
    "short": "The adjective obtuse is good for describing someone slow on the uptake: \"Don't be so obtuse: get with the program!\"",
    "long": "The adjective obtuse literally means \"rounded\" or \"blunt,\" but when it's used for a person, it means \"not quick or alert in perception\" — in other words, not the sharpest tool in the shed. It's not just for dull people, but also dull angles: in geometry, an obtuse angle is one that is not so sharp (between 90 and 180 degrees)."
  },
  "practitioner": {
    "short": "A practitioner is an expert who uses that knowledge as part of a profession. Every yoga practitioner started by attending an introductory class.",
    "long": "In practitioner, you can see the word practice, which everyone says will make you perfect. Practice can also mean the clients, daily activities, and location where a professional such as a doctor works. So a practitioner is someone who has learned everything about his or her field and is actively working in that field. So don't worry about going to the doctor — you won't be practice for this practitioner."

  "overweening": {
    "short": "Overweening is a negative term meaning arrogant or excessive. People can be described as having overweening pride or overweening ambition. It's too much and not good.",
    "long": "Confidence and pride are okay in moderation. Overweening means having too much of it though so that it overtakes the rest of your personality, and not in a good way. If your football team has won every game of the season, they need to watch that they don't become overweening and start playing games as if they have already won."
  },
  "gravel": {
    "short": "Gravel is very small, irregular pieces of rock and stone. Your gravel driveway might crunch under your boots as you walk to the mailbox.",
    "long": "Roads, paths, walkways, and yards are all sometimes paved with gravel, which is a relatively inexpensive material to use for marking areas and preventing the growth of weeds and other plants. Gravel is more rough and rocky than sand, and smaller than stones. The word gravel comes from the French word gravele, \"gravel or sand,\" which in turn comes from grave, \"seashore or sand.\" The ultimate Proto-Indo-European root may be ghreu, \"to rub or grind.\""

  "obstacle": {
    "short": "When the road is blocked ahead of you, that blockage is an obstacle that keeps you from getting where you want to go.",
    "long": "The Latin word that is the source of the word obstacle combines parts that mean \"to stand in the way of,\" so an obstacle is something that stands against what you want to do. In a dramatic piece, the obstacle is the person or thing that keeps a character from achieving his or her goal. This creates the conflict in a play: since conflict is what drama is all about, the obstacle is the source of all drama."

  "strip": {
    "short": "The verb strip has many shades of meaning, but most of them involve removing something. Someone may strip you of your power or you may strip off your clothes. Whatever it is that you strip, it’s gone.",
    "long": "When you strip something, you leave it bare. Strip can refer to removing a covering — like your clothes or like when you strip your sheets from your bed. Robbers may strip your car of all valuable items. And you might need to strip off a coat of paint before you start painting the front door. When used as a noun, strip could be something in a long, narrow shape — like an airstrip or a strip of material."
  },
  "tacit": {
    "short": "Something tacit is implied or understood without question. Holding hands might be a tacit acknowledgment that a boy and girl are dating.",
    "long": "The adjective tacit refers to information that is understood without needing to acknowledge it. For example, since we know that the sky is blue, that kind of assumption is tacit. Lawyers talk about \"tacit agreements,\" where parties give their silent consent and raise no objections."
  },
  "itinerary": {
    "short": "An itinerary is your travel plan — where you will go and when you will be there.",
    "long": "If you make plans to fly to Paris from Beijing or take a train to Chicago from Mexico City, you will need an itinerary. That means you will have a plan that displays how you will get from point to point in your travels and when you will be at each point. This word comes from the Middle English itinerarius and is defined as being \"about a journey.\" Itineraries can be really useful because if you give your mother yours, she will always know where you are!"
  },
  "queer": {
    "short": "The adjective queer means \"unusual\" or \"peculiar,\" or sometimes \"suspicious.\" The main character in a creepy novel might decide to investigate the queer noises she hears coming from the attic in the middle of the night. Uh oh.",
    "long": "Like many words, queer has many meanings. One is \"odd,\" as in \"I feel kind of queer today.\" In the 20th century, queer also began to be used as a slur for members of the LGBT community; although use of the word is still controversial today, it has been widely reclaimed as a positive or neutral term. Many universities have Queer Studies programs, for instance. As a verb, queer can mean \"to endanger or expose to risk\", and also \"to hinder, thwart, foil, or baffle.\""
  },
  "apocalypse": {
    "short": "Apocalypse is a word that means \"the end of the world\" — or something so destructive it seems like the world has ended in a place, like a major earthquake.",
    "long": "The apocalypse is the total destruction of the world, as prophesied in the biblical book of Revelation. Apocalypse can be used to describe utter destruction caused by war or natural disaster. The nuclear bomb attack on Hiroshima during World War II can be called an apocalypse because the devastation was so severe and so many lives were lost."
  },
  "restrain": {
    "short": "Restrain means to hold yourself back, which is exactly what you'd have to do if, after weeks of dieting, you found yourself face to face with a dessert case filled with pies, cakes, and cookies.",
    "long": "Restrain can also mean to restrict or hold back someone else, to prevent someone from doing what they're intending to do. Prison guards have to restrain a prisoner who is trying to attack one of his fellow inmates. That prisoner might even be put in handcuffs — a kind of restraint. You can restrain yourself, for example if you're watching a Broadway show and suddenly feel the urge to sing along. Your fellow audience members would be grateful for your restraint, especially if you've got a terrible voice."

  "burgeoning": {
    "short": "Use the verb burgeon to describe something that is growing, expanding, and flourishing. If you have a green thumb, in the spring your flower gardens may burgeon. If you don't have a green thumb, your collection of plastic plants may burgeon.",
    "long": "Although burgeon means to grow and flourish, it doesn't necessarily have to apply only to plants. Your town can have burgeoning downtown development. Your tiny retirement account can burgeon into an excellent emergency fund if you invest even a small amount each month. You may have a burgeoning career as a villain if you overthrow a planet by using your mind-controlling ray gun on the populace."
  },
  "attentive": {
    "short": "Use the adjective attentive to describe someone who is alert and paying attention: “Attentive observers of the play used clues given in the first scenes of the play to guess the identity of the murderer.”",
    "long": "You probably notice that the word attentive looks a lot like the noun attention. It’s easy to remember how to use attentive when you know that the words share related meanings. Use the adjective attentive to describe someone who is full of attention, watching and listening carefully, such as an attentive student who takes great notes and asks questions when something isn't clear."
  },
  "resonant": {
    "short": "Resonant describes sound that is deep and rich. It also can mean deeply evocative. A resonant  speech moves you by bringing to mind all that is good in the world: family, friends, laughter.",
    "long": "Resonant comes from the Latin re, meaning again, and sonare, meaning to sound––or literally to sound again or echo. So resonant's meanings all have that sense of reverberating or echoing. Not only does it mean echoing or evoking meaning, but it also refers to sound that echoes through a room. Don't confuse the spellings of resonant (the adjective) and resonate (the verb)."
  },
  "circumspect": {
    "short": "If you are circumspect, you think carefully before doing or saying anything. A good quality in someone entrusted with responsibility, though sometimes boring in a friend.",
    "long": "The word circumspect was borrowed from Latin circumspectus, from circumspicere, \"to be cautious.\" The basic meaning of Latin circumspicere is \"to look around.\" Near synonyms are prudent and cautious, though circumspect implies a careful consideration of all circumstances and a desire to avoid mistakes and bad consequences."
  },
  "maxim": {
    "short": "A maxim is a succinct formulation of a principle, rule, or basic truth about life. Usually clever, maxims are like great sayings everybody knows. Ben Franklin is the author of many, including \"Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\"",
    "long": "A maxim sums up a fundamental principle or truth about something in a way that captures the imagination and gets repeated. Diana Vreeland, the legendary editor of Vogue magazine, once said, \"Pink is the navy blue of India.\" May not be true, but it was such a great line it has become a maxim of fashion and even of India. An overused maxim of real estate is \"Location, location, location.\" Confucius was spewing maxims long before Vogue hit the magazine stands: \"He who learns but does not think is lost.\""

  "comprise": {
    "short": "When something comprises other things, it is made up of them or formed from them. The periodic table comprises 118 elements, because the whole comprises the parts.",
    "long": "In its traditional use, the word comprise is the opposite of compose: if A comprises X, Y, and Z, then X, Y, and Z compose A. But because compose and comprise sound so much alike, people have long confused the two. So now you often hear things like \"The band is comprised of a guitarist, a bassist, and a hairy drummer,\" whereas sticklers would prefer \"is composed of\" in that sentence. The word is undergoing a usage shift, making it just as hairy as that drummer!"
  },
  "prophetic": {
    "short": "If you make a prediction and it comes true, your words were prophetic. Like the time you warned your dad against eating a whole box of donuts.  He got sick, right?  That was a prophetic warning.",
    "long": "The adjective prophetic traces all the way back to the Greek word prophētikos, meaning \"predicting.\" You know who's really good at predicting stuff? Prophets. Usually, prophetic is used to describe a thing — like a warning, a feeling, or a complaint — rather than a person."
  },
  "brood": {
    "short": "A brood is a group of young born at the same time — like a brood of chicks — but your parents might use the word for you and your siblings: \"We're taking the whole brood to the movies tonight.\"",
    "long": "Brood is also what a chicken does when she sits on her eggs to hatch them. You can also brood, when you worry and sulk and dwell on something obsessively — maybe as tedious as sitting on eggs, but no chicks when you're done. Things like clouds or silence can also brood, hanging over something ominously, as a storm that broods over the sea, sending fishermen scurrying for safety."
  },
  "colossal": {
    "short": "Colossal describes something so large it makes you say,  \"Whoa!\" You might have a colossal amount of homework, or see a colossal pyramid while vacationing in Egypt.",
    "long": "Colossal can refer to an item's physical size, like a giant redwood tree, but it can also be used to describe the force or scope of something — like the colossal force of a thunderstorm that knocked down the redwood tree, or the colossal scope of your school project on the history of the redwoods that seems like it will never, ever end. It comes from the Greek word kolossos, meaning \"gigantic statue.\""
  },
  "contend": {
    "short": "To defend a belief or keep affirming that it's true is to contend. People used to contend that the earth was flat, but eventually, when no one dropped off the edge no matter how far they traveled, the \"round\" theory won.",
    "long": "One of the meanings of contend is from the French \"to strive with,\" and it is a literal fighting, as in \"to contend with fists.\" Most contemporary uses of the verb contend illustrate competitions of proof or defense, where a person will contend that something is true, or better, or wrong. It is still a striving but more of a verbal kind, where what you contend is what you hope to convince others is correct."
  },
  "measured": {
    "short": "Things done in a deliberate, rhythmic way are measured. When you're walking toward a deer in the woods, trying not to scare it off, you'll take slow, measured steps.",
    "long": "When you meditate, you take measured breaths and pay attention to the inhale and exhale. And your measured strides up the side of a mountain trail will carry you more quickly to the top than short, erratic bursts of walking and stopping. Measured also means \"thoughtful\" or \"careful,\" like the measured words you use in your delicately worded resignation letter."
  },
  "endorse": {
    "short": "To endorse is to give support to someone or something. \"I endorse this!\" means \"I think this is a good thing, and so should you.\"",
    "long": "People endorse in many ways. When someone endorses a politician, it means \"You should vote for this person, and I'm putting my reputation on the line to say so.\" When someone endorses a product in a commercial, it means \"Go buy this! You'll like it.\" To endorse is to give support. You can also endorse a check, which means writing your name or someone else's on the back so that you or the other person can cash or deposit it."
  },
  "appall": {
    "short": "That tattoo on your lower back is likely to appall your mother. Just like her pink hair once appalled your grandmother. To appall is to shock and disgust.",
    "long": "Appall comes from an Old French word meaning \"to make pale.\" If a gory scene in a movie appalls you, you're likely to turn pale. The word appall always carries with it the feeling of disgust. You might be shocked by a loud noise, but in order for it to appall you, it would probably have to come along with a really foul smell or a gruesome scene."
  },
  "sentiment": {
    "short": "Your opinion that most comedies are terrible and that you'd rather watch any other kind of movie could be described as your sentiment, or your attitude, about films.",
    "long": "Sentiment means a view or opinion, but it can also mean an emotion. Maybe you prefer tragic movies because you enjoy the sentiment of sadness. This meaning of sentiment is taken to an extreme in yet another version of the word, meaning something like \"overdone, exaggerated feelings, especially of sadness or nostalgia.\" An overly soppy tragedy is a good example of this kind of sentiment; it's the kind of film that might make you cringe instead of cry."
  },
  "signal": {
    "short": "A signal is a gesture or message that people use to communicate with each other. The wave you give a good friend to call her over from across the room and the impulse that transmits your voice through the telephone to your mother are both signals.",
    "long": "In the course of a single day, you probably send and receive thousands of different signals. When you want to cross the street, you wait for the green light — a signal that it's safe to cross. If you're in a relationship and you're not sure whether you like the person you're dating, you could be sending mixed signals — first acting like you're interested, and then acting uninterested. If your date finally gets tired of your mixed signals while you're at a restaurant, you'll need to signal to your server that it's time for the check."
  },
  "sedulous": {
    "short": "A sedulous person is someone who works hard and doesn't give up easily.  If you make repeated and sedulous attempts to fix a leaky pipe and it only makes things worse, it might be time to go online and find the number of a plumber.",
    "long": "There are a couple of words that basically mean the same thing as sedulous but are a little more common, namely assiduous, painstaking, and diligent.  Like sedulous, all of these adjectives can be turned into adverbs by adding the suffix ly: \"He assiduously tried to fix the pipe, but to no avail.\""
  },
  "paramount": {
    "short": "To the President, protecting our nation's security is of paramount importance — it's at the very top of his to-do list.",
    "long": "Paramount goes way beyond \"important.\" It's absolutely critical. Something that is of paramount importance has a great urgency to it. Getting your oil changed is important, but making sure your car's brakes are working before you drive down a steep, icy slope is absolutely paramount."

    "long": "The word replicate carries different shades of meaning, but it generally involves repeating something. Students of biology will know that the word is often used to indicate that an exact duplicate has been made, such as chromosomes that replicate themselves. It can also be used in an unscientific sense to mean that something has been done again to match or repeat an earlier outcome, such as a political group that works to replicate a successful campaign."
  },
  "pungent": {
    "short": "Use pungent to describe a taste or smell that gives a sharp sensation. \"What is that pungent odor?\" is a polite way of suggesting that someone in the room has BO.",
    "long": "The ultimate source of the word pungent is Latin pungere \"to prick, sting.\" Ginger and mustard seed are examples of pungent spices. Limburger cheese has the distinction of being the most pungent of all cheeses. And if your pet has an accident in the house, there may be a pungent odor. And pungent can be used in a figurative sense: pungent language is stimulating and expressive."
  },
  "exempt": {
    "short": "If your accountant tells you that you’re exempt from taxes this year, give him a big hug. He is saying that you don’t have to pay taxes.",
    "long": "The adjective exempt traces back to the Latin word exemptus, meaning “to remove or take out” or “to free”. So if you are exempt, you are free of an obligation that others have to fulfill, such as paying taxes. But you can also be exempt from having to obey certain rules, like seniors being exempt from having to sell candy bars for a school fundraiser."
  },
  "photosynthesis": {
    "short": "Plants absorb sunlight and turn that energy into food; the process is known as photosynthesis.",
    "long": "This is a compound word made up of photo (which means \"light\") and synthesis (which means \"to put together\"). Think of a synthesizer, which puts together different sounds to produce music. A plant uses light to put together chemical compounds and turn them into carbohydrates: food. Although the word can be used to describe any process that uses light to connect compounds, the word is almost always used to describe a plant's method of making food."
  },
  "deviate": {
    "short": "If something turns off course or is diverted, it deviates from the expected or the norm. Deviating from explicit recipe directions is never a good idea, unless you want inedible food or a kitchen fire.",
    "long": "The verb deviate can refer to divergence from a predicted path or road (\"the airplane's route deviated from the flight plan\"), but it can also refer to a divergence from normal behavior or expectations. When women demanded the right to vote, their behavior was considered shocking and deviated from the expectations of the time."
  },
  "vituperate": {
    "short": "To vituperate is to speak or write in an extremely negative way about someone.",
    "long": "Just as vituperation consists of negative, explosive, malicious outbursts, to vituperate is to communicate in this way. Negative political ads vituperate against opponents. When you insult someone and swear at them, you vituperate. People with a short temper tend to vituperate often — it's similar to railing, vilifying, and reviling. The root word is the Latin vituperationem, \"blame or censuring,\" from vitium, \"fault or defect.\""
  },
  "eschew": {
    "short": "If you eschew something, you deliberately avoid it. If you live the bohemian life in the city, then most likely you eschew the suburbs.",
    "long": "Eschew comes from a word meaning dread, or shun. So to eschew something isn’t simply to avoid it, the way you would avoid walking in a puddle––it's stronger than that. You eschew things that you find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might eschew a chocolate sundae, not because he doesn’t like it, but because he’s afraid of what it will do to his waistline."
  },
  "verisimilar": {
    "short": "The adjective verisimilar describes something that appears to be true or real but may not be. If you want to impress your friends, remark on the verisimilar portrait of lost love in that foreign film you all went to see.",
    "long": "Verisimilar comes from Latin. You’ll notice the word similar at the end, which means “like.” Veri- comes from the word veritas, meaning “truth.” Something that is verisimilar is “like true,” but is not necessarily actually true. A painting of your uncle Marvin, for example, might be so good that it’s verisimilar, in that it almost looks like Uncle Marvin is standing right there — but he isn't."
  },
  "adroit": {
    "short": "Someone who is adroit is clever and skillful. An adroit leader will be able to persuade people to go with his ideas. An adroit sculptor can turn a lump of clay into an object of great beauty.",
    "long": "If you've ever studied French you know that droit means \"right,\" both as in \"right of free speech\" and as in \"left and right,\" and à droit means both \"turn right\" and \"properly.\" Once English people borrowed à droit, they changed the meaning slightly, from doing something \"properly\" to \"doing something well.\" You may have heard the expression \"surprisingly adroit,\" as in, \"For a guy whose wife does all the cooking, he is surprisingly adroit in the kitchen.\""
  },
  "improvidence": {
    "short": "Improvidence is a tendency to act rashly, without carefully thinking things through first. It was your own improvidence that led you to spend all your money on video games instead of saving for your upcoming trip to Disneyland.",
    "long": "You may think of your tendency to stand up in moving vehicles or jump from high places as spontaneity or playfulness, but it can also be seen as improvidence. Spending money irresponsibly or extravagantly is also commonly described as improvidence. However you use this word, it should always convey a lack of foresight, or neglecting to think about the future. The Latin roots are im-, \"not,\" and providentia, \"foresight.\""
  },
  "circumvent": {
    "short": "To circumvent is to avoid. Someone who trains elephants but somehow gets out of picking up after them has found a way to circumvent the cleaning of the circus tent.",
    "long": "Circum in Latin means \"around\" or \"round about,\" and vent- comes from venire, \"to come,\" but painting a picture from these two parts of the word helps. Picture someone circling around a barrier instead of climbing over it. That's what you do when you circumvent. You find a smart way around rules or barriers, or avoid doing something unpleasant altogether."
  },
  "chivalrous": {
    "short": "A person who is courteous and attentive can be described as chivalrous: “The chivalrous stranger picked up the packages Veronica dropped and held the door open while she entered the apartment building.”",
    "long": "The word chivalrous originally described gallantry, valor, honor, and courtesy, associated with the medieval code of knighthood. Medieval knights are no longer with us, but chivalrous has survived in modern usage, usually to describe a man — or a behavior — showing courtesy or attentiveness toward women. So the guy holding the door open for you with a flourish may or may not be your “knight in shining armor,\" but his chivalrous act gives him something in common with the medieval knights of lore."
  },
  "bonhomie": {
    "short": "If you are known for your bonhomie, that's a good thing. It means that you are a cheerful friendly sort of person. Keep it up.",
    "long": "Any French speaker will recognize that the noun bonhomie is related to bon homme — French for \"good man.\" However, a woman can exude a spirit of bonhomie as well, as long as she is cheery and kind. If you are looking to infuse a depressing setting with bonhomie, try cracking a joke or setting your beret at a rakish angle."
  },
  "constrain": {
    "short": "To constrain is to hold back, restrain, or confine. If you've ever had to constrain a toddler in the middle of a temper tantrum, you know you have to watch out for flailing limbs.",
    "long": "The verb constrain comes from the Latin word constringere, which means to bind together or tie tightly. Constrain can imply both literal and figurative bindings. You can constrain someone by physically holding on to something like a person's shirt. Or, you can figuratively constrain someone by putting up obstacles. Your teenagers, for example, may feel constrained by your rules and accuse you of sucking the fun out of their social lives."
  },
  "affable": {
    "short": "Affable means friendly, pleasant, and easy to talk to. An affable host offers you something to drink and makes you feel at home.",
    "long": "The adjective affable entered English by way of the Latin word affābilis, which means \"kind, friendly.\" If you’re stuck on an airplane next to someone affable, the trip won’t be so bad because that person will be easy to chat with but won’t talk your ear off. Synonyms of affable also refer to a pleasant and mild friendliness, such as genial, hospitable, and gracious. Affable people generally seem like they’re in a good mood and are happy to see you."
  },
  "adept": {
    "short": "Are you looking for another word to describe a person who is highly skilled, very proficient or expert at something? Try the adjective adept!",
    "long": "In the days of Medieval Latin, an adeptus was a person who had learned the secrets of alchemy. Although an adept person today cannot turn lead into gold, the adjective is still high praise meaning \"skilled, expert, highly proficient.\""
  },
  "expatiate": {
    "short": "The verb expatiate means \"to add details to in order to clear up.\" If your story is confusing to everyone who hears it, certain key parts must be missing. Better expatiate so that people can understand it.",
    "long": "To pronounce expatiate correctly, accent the second syllable: \"ex-PAY-she-ate.\" When you expatiate on a piece of writing, you add details. The goal is to make your ideas clearer to readers, perhaps by offering an example to help them understand. Teachers can tell when you are expatiating and when you are just adding to what you've written, say, to reach a certain length requirement. That's usually called \"padding.\""
  },
  "dilemma": {
    "short": "A dilemma is a tough choice. When you're in a difficult situation and each option looks equally bad, you're in a dilemma.",
    "long": "Dilemma is from a Greek for \"double proposition.\" It was originally a technical term of logic, but we use it now for any time you have a problem with no satisfactory solution. If you're at the mall choosing between red or blue socks, that's not really a dilemma. But if you have to choose whether to save your cat or your dog from a burning building, that's an awful dilemma."
  },
  "opprobrium": {
    "short": "If you go against or oppose what's good, you might earn opprobrium — the opposite of getting attention for something good. Bad behavior leads to opprobrium. If you throw a soft drink off the theater balcony, the opprobrium might keep you from getting dates to the movies.",
    "long": "Even though the words aren't related, the \"opp-\" of the word opprobrium sounds a bit like the \"app\" part of \"inappropriate.\" Opprobrium isn't an action that leads to disgrace, it's something that comes from the inappropriate thing that was done. A very inappropriate act leads to opprobrium for the person who did the act. \"Infamy\" — extreme dishonor, often with lasting consequences — is a synonym for opprobrium."
  },
  "sporadic": {
    "short": "Sporadic is an adjective that you can use to refer to something that happens or appears often, but not constantly or regularly. The mail carrier comes every day but the plumber's visits are sporadic — he comes as needed.",
    "long": "A specialized use of sporadic is to describe a disease that appears only occasionally in random cases, and is therefore not an epidemic.  Mostly, though, you'll hear this word used to describe anything that happens occasionally, like your family's sporadic trips to visit your distant cousins in Ohio or the sporadic bake sales your science club sponsors when it's low on funds. English borrowed the word sporadic from Greek sporadikós, \"scattered.\""
  },
  "flabbergasted": {
    "short": "When you see your mom come back from the salon with bright green spiky hair and your jaw drops to the floor in total shock, you’re flabbergasted. You are really, really shocked — pretty much speechless.",
    "long": "Use the adjective flabbergasted to describe someone who's astounded or surprised for any reason, good or bad. You could be flabbergasted at how astonishingly expensive a parking ticket is, or at how incredibly delicious pineapple pizza is. Flabbergasted has been used since the late 18th century, but no one knows for sure where it originated. The word sounds like what it means: when you say it out loud — \"flabbergasted!\" — it somehow captures the spirit of astonishment and shock."
  },
  "demonstrate": {
    "short": "When you demonstrate something, you show what it is or how it works. To demonstrate how your new juicer works, you should have lots of kale, carrots, and beets on hand — and some brave friends to try your concoction.",
    "long": "Demonstrate comes from the Latin word demonstrare, meaning “to point out by argument or deduction.” To demonstrate a point you must make a valid argument and give examples of why you think it's true. Demonstrate can also refer to a public protest. You can demonstrate with your comrades by marching through the streets with homemade protest signs."
  },
  "bon voyage": {
    "short": "You can use the expression bon voyage to wish a friend well as she sets off on a trip.",
    "long": "Bon voyage literally means \"good voyage\" in French, and it can be used as an exclamation, a playful or sophisticated way to send someone off on a journey. You could also throw a bon voyage party, if you were celebrating with a friend who was about to embark on a long trip. English-speakers first began using the expression in the late 1600s."
  },
  "canon": {
    "short": "Canon (one “n”) refers to a collection of rules or texts that are considered to be authoritative. Shakespeare and Chaucer are part of the canon of Western literature, so you might read their work in an English class.",
    "long": "A canon can also be a body of work, like the Shakespeare canon, which includes all of the Bard's plays and poems. These days, many schools and colleges include more diverse and underrepresented authors in literature classes and encourage students to read works not included in the standard literary canon. The literary canon can change with time, and so can the cultural canon. Don't confuse this word with cannon with two n's, the big gun that shoots bowling-size balls at the enemy."
  },
  "integrity": {
    "short": "Integrity is a personal quality of fairness that we all aspire to — unless you're a dishonest, immoral scoundrel, of course.",
    "long": "Having integrity means doing the right thing in a reliable way. It's a personality trait that we admire, since it means a person has a moral compass that doesn't waver. It literally means having \"wholeness\" of character, just as an integer is a \"whole number\" with no fractions. Physical objects can display integrity, too — if you're going over a rickety old bridge that sways in the wind, you might question its structural integrity."
  },
  "elucidate": {
    "short": "If you elucidate something, you explain it very clearly. If you don't understand fractions, a visit to the pie shop may elucidate the subject for you.",
    "long": "Elucidate, meaning \"to make clear,\" is from the Late Latin elucidare, from the Latin prefix e-, \"thoroughly,\" and lucidus, \"clear, bright.\"  See the word lucid in elucidate? That's an adjective which describes someone who thinks clearly or something that is clear enough to understand."
  },
  "stalwart": {
    "short": "To be stalwart is to be courageous and dependable, like a stalwart knight who defends a kingdom from a ferocious dragon.",
    "long": "Stalwart can describe someone who's able to keep on going even when things get hard, like a marathon runner who doesn't slow down even after spraining an ankle, or a supporter of a political cause that everyone else has long declared over. In U.S. history, the word stalwart was used in 1877 to describe Republicans who remained unwilling to trust the South, even though the Civil War was long over by that time."
  },
  "indict": {
    "short": "If you accuse someone of committing an offense, you indict them. A book that indicts the entire education system might lay out all the reasons that schools are failing kids.",
    "long": "In a legal sense, the verb indict means to bring formal charges against someone, especially in a court of law, as in a federal grand jury. The grand jury indicted, the man on 12 counts of murder. Although it's true the boy had stolen cookies from the cookie jar in the past, that is no reason to indict him out of hand in the present case. There were no witnesses and the crumb evidence would suggest someone else committed the crime."
  },
  "backbite": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "reprimand": {
    "short": "If you're reprimanded, someone in authority speaks to you in an angry way because you've done something wrong. Or you might reprimand your dog if he steals your hot dog.",
    "long": "The House of Representatives has a couple of ways to punish naughty members. One way is to reprimand them by voting to express disapproval. In 2009, Representative Joe Wilson was reprimanded after his outburst of \"You lie!\" during President Obama's speech. In the halls of Congress, this is considered \"unparliamentary language,\" but if you yell at your congressman, that's okay."
  },
  "evocative": {
    "short": "Use the adjective evocative when you want to describe something that reminds you of something else. If your mom baked a lot when you were a kid, the smell of cookies in the oven is probably evocative of your childhood.",
    "long": "Evocative comes from the Latin word evocare, which means to \"call out\" or \"summon.\"  Think of a batch of cookies summoning a memory from your childhood. To summon something you need a voice, and indeed, the Latin word for voice is vocare.  Other related words include the noun vocation, which means \"a calling.\""
  },
  "definitive": {
    "short": "A definitive answer is a final one. A definitive decision by a court of law is one that will not be changed. A definitive translation is one everyone turns to as correct. Definitive means authoritative, conclusive, final.",
    "long": "Be careful not to confuse definitive with definite. Definite means clearly defined. You can have a definite opinion that JFK could not have been assassinated by a lone gunman, but the definitive interpretation remains that of the Warren Commission Report, which held there was only one."
  },
  "evocation": {
    "short": "Does the taste of a particular candy bar suddenly whisk you back to an earlier time in your life? That's an evocation, the summoning, usually unconscious, of a memory or emotional state caused by a particular stimulus.",
    "long": "The word invocation is often used interchangeably with evocation, though in fact they have quite different meanings. An invocation is a deliberate — as opposed to accidental or unconscious — summoning of a God or other form of supernatural power for aid. Very different, you'll agree. Unless of course you're trying to invoke the God of candy bars."
  },
  "reverse": {
    "short": "To go in reverse, you back up. If you reverse your position, you suddenly take the opposite side of the argument. If you reverse your fortunes, your bad luck turns good, or your good luck turns bad. Oops.",
    "long": "The Latin word revertere means “turn back.” To reverse means to turn back, take the opposite direction, go the other way. Many things can be reversed: you can reverse a decision, you can reverse a car — by putting it in the gear called \"reverse.\" You can reverse a political argument, a promotion, even some surgical procedures, but you can never reverse the steady progress of time, no matter how many Botox injections you get."
  },
  "forbearance": {
    "short": "When a teacher says, \"Bear with me for a moment,\" while he writes on the board, he is asking for the class's forbearance. He wants them to wait patiently during the delay.",
    "long": "Forbearance also has a more technical, legal meaning — if you are owed money and you give someone extra time to get it to you, you're showing them forbearance. The word has nothing to do with actual bears, but if you think of one slumbering through its winter hibernation, that might help remember its meaning."
  },
  "finicky": {
    "short": "You reject any vegetable that isn't yellow. You like basmati rice, but detest jasmine, Arborio, and brown. You dine at one restaurant, and you always order the same meal. You are a finicky eater — that is, you are quite particular about food.",
    "long": "Fastidious, fussy, picky, persnickety: these are all synonyms for finicky, and they all suggest someone with extremely exacting tastes and habits, someone almost impossible to please. Finicky can also be used to describe something that demands a great deal of care and attention to detail — a finicky lock might require that you jiggle the key just so. Finicky generally conveys the sense that the person or thing it describes is quirky and pointlessly precise."
  },
  "shackle": {
    "short": "Handcuffs are shackles. So are those leg irons some prisoners wear when they appear in court. In other words, a shackle is a restraint, either physical or psychological, that restricts movement.",
    "long": "We generally think of shackles as some sort of heavy metal cuff that is used to keep prisoners in check. But shackles don't have to be physical. Ignorance can be a shackle, so can an abusive family member, or the economy. In those cases, shackles are an external force that keep you from doing or being everything you want to. You can't see those shackles, but they can be every bit as confining as the metal cuffs."
  },
  "recondite": {
    "short": "It's rather difficult to penetrate the meaning of recondite. Fitting, because it's an adjective that basically means hard for the average mind to understand.",
    "long": "If it's really hard to comprehend, then it's safe to say it's recondite.  In the same family as \"abstruse,\" \"esoteric\" and \"totally deep, man,\" recondite is a very serious word that you could use to describe obscure philosophy books, high level mathematical theory, and the series finale of The Sopranos — you know, things that make your brain hurt."
  },
  "benevolent": {
    "short": "Choose the adjective benevolent for someone who does good deeds or shows goodwill. If your teacher collects homework with a benevolent smile, she's hoping that you've done a good job.",
    "long": "Benevolent comes from the Latin bene, \"well,\" and volent, from a verb meaning \"to wish.\"  A benevolent society is a charity group organized to serve a community through programs, sponsorships, and donations. The expression \"benevolent dictatorship\" may seem like an oxymoron, but it is a political term for an authoritative government that (supposedly) works for the good of the people under its rule."
  },
  "predominant": {
    "short": "If you’re talking about the most popular or common thing, call it predominant. If the predominant feeling in a neighborhood is that pizza is the best food, the result might be pizzerias being the predominant type of restaurant there.",
    "long": "The adjective predominant describes a person or thing with great power or influence, or something that is prevalent. It comes from the Latin prefix prae-, “before,” and dominari, “to rule.” For example, because so many people like hip-hop, it might be the predominant music heard at a school dance. And that neighborhood with all the pizzerias? Teenagers are the predominant customers, and pepperoni is the predominant topping."
  },
  "suspend": {
    "short": "You can use the verb suspend any time you need to stop something. Whether it’s your judgment, a rule, or bus service, when you suspend it, you temporarily bring it to a halt.",
    "long": "Suspend often describes stopping an activity for a while. A winter storm, for example, may suspend air travel until weather conditions improve. Suspend also works in a more figurative sense, such as when you suspend your doubt in order to give someone or something a fair chance. A student who is suspended is temporarily forbidden from attending class. Don't confuse this with expel, which means he or she may never return."
  },
  "stratagem": {
    "short": "A stratagem is a scheme or a clever plot. You can have a stratagem for winning a chess game, getting the girl (or boy), and avoiding a punishment. However, your opponents, crushes, and parents may have a trick or two of their own.",
    "long": "Sometimes a stratagem is a gem of an idea, really clever and worth trying. Great generals start a battle plan with a stratagem, and businesses might have a stratagem for making more money. A stratagem is often a trick or a way to deceive an enemy or get something through a plot or ploy, but it can also mean just a great idea that outwits someone. Your teacher probably has a stratagem for helping you remember and spell words."
  },
  "anarchy": {
    "short": "Use the noun anarchy to describe a complete lack of government — or the chaotic state of affairs created by such an absence. A substitute teacher might worry that an unruly classroom will descend into anarchy.",
    "long": "From the Greek for \"without a ruler\" we get this word for the political philosophy that the best government is no government at all — a movement that enjoyed surprising success worldwide in the early and middle parts of the twentieth century. Today, the word is more commonly used to describe not a political ideal but a state of total disorder, chaos and even violence: \"A type of bloody anarchy is beginning to reign.\" A good synonym would be \"lawlessness.\""
  },
  "incense": {
    "short": "Incense means both \"to make angry\" and a stick that burns slowly and emits a strong smell. If your new college roommate burns incense in your tiny dorm room, you might get incensed and storm out.",
    "long": "How can a word that means a substance that is burned for its sweet odor come to mean \"make very angry\"? Both have to do with the idea of burning, and the Latin root incendere, \"to set on fire.\" A stick of incense must be lit, or set on fire to release its smell. When you are incensed by something, such as your teacher slamming you with homework on the night of the prom, you feel like you are burning with anger."
  },
  "anomalous": {
    "short": "Something that deviates from the norm is anomalous. Something anomalous can be good, such as an exciting new direction in music or art. But that anomalously low score on your math test? Not so good.",
    "long": "To find the origins of the word anomalous we can go back to the Greek anṓmalos,  meaning \"uneven or irregular.\" Something that is anomalous is not just different; it is also unexpected, and may even be completely inconsistent with the norm. For example, the recent discovery of ice, and therefore water, on the moon was anomalous to all previous ideas that the moon was lifeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n."
  },
  "palatial": {
    "short": "Knowing that the adjective palatial is derived from the same Latin word as palace gives you a good sense of its meaning: magnificent, reminiscent of a home fit for a king.",
    "long": "The Palatine (Collis Palatium in Latin) is the center of Rome’s famed Seven Hills. Tradition holds that it was the location on which Romulus founded the city, and it became a prestigious site for powerful Romans—including emperors—to build large, lavish homes. Palatium made its way into every Romance language and beyond: it became palazzo in Italian, palacio in Spanish, and palast in German. Palace entered English via the Old French palais. Power, affluence, extravagance: these are the qualities that should come to mind when you encounter the word palatial."
  },
  "voluptuous": {
    "short": "The adjective voluptuous is used to describe someone who is attractive and curvy. Marilyn Monroe was known for her voluptuous figure.",
    "long": "Being voluptuous means being full-figured and curvy, but this word doesn't only apply to body types. A house that's luxurious, lavishly decorated, and full of delicious food could also be called voluptuous. This word derives from a Latin root meaning \"delightful or pleasurable.\""
  },
  "haunt": {
    "short": "The verb to haunt means to appear as a ghost or some kind of supernatural phenomenon. Ebenezer Scrooge was haunted by the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future.",
    "long": "The first recorded usage of the word haunt is in William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, a play filled with supernatural characters running around scaring the knickers off each other.  As Shakespeare knew, haunting is at its most effective in the passive voice, because there is much more drama in being haunted than haunting. Another use of the word haunt is as a noun, and it means \"a place that is frequented often,\" like a popular hangout.  The gym, a bar, a corner: these are all potential haunts.  The dentist, the principal’s office, a busy intersection: these are not."
  },
  "dichotomy": {
    "short": "A dichotomy is an idea or classification split in two. When you point out a dichotomy, you draw a clear distinction between two things.",
    "long": "A dichotomy is a contrast between two things. When there are two ideas, especially two opposed ideas — like war and peace, or love and hate — you have a dichotomy. You often hear about a \"false dichotomy,\" which occurs when a situation is unfairly represented as an \"either/or\" scenario. For example, the statement \"All cars are either small and efficient or large and polluting\" creates a false dichotomy because there are some cars that don't fit into either category."
  },
  "desperate": {
    "short": "Desperate means \"having lost all hope.\" If you are desperate for food, it means you are starving, possibly about to die. If you are in a desperate situation, it means things are really, really bad.",
    "long": "Desperate, desparate, or despirate? The word desperate is misspelled often enough that it's the despair of English teachers. Both desperate and despair come from the same Latin verb as despair. Don't mix it up with disparate, a totally different word that means \"distinctive, different, various.\""
  },
  "conflict": {
    "short": "A conflict is a struggle or an opposition. If you and your best friend both fall in love with the same person, you will have to find some way to resolve the conflict.",
    "long": "Conflict comes from the Latin word for striking, but it isn't always violent. Conflict can arise from opposing ideas. If you want to turn your empty lot into a community garden but your wife envisions a shooting range, you have a conflict. If you're torn between two different desires, you're conflicted. Conflict can also be a verb. If you schedule a dentist appointment that conflicts with a meeting, you'll have to cancel one of them."
  },
  "rebuff": {
    "short": "If you rebuff someone, you reject or snub him. You might decide to rebuff a classmate's invitation to the dance after hearing him gossip meanly about a friend.",
    "long": "Although the verb rebuff is a somewhat old fashioned one to use for social relationships, it's still common in the world of diplomacy. One country's rebuff of another might start a war, or end peace talks, or otherwise reverberate through the world of international relations. You can also use rebuff as a noun — deliberately ignoring your sister's text message is one example of a rebuff. The Italian root word, ribuffo, combines ri, expressing opposition, and buffo, \"a puff.\""

  "lissome": {
    "short": "Lissome describes people or things that are slender, flexible, light, and graceful. If you watch long, thin blades of grass swishing in the breeze, they look like lissome dancers with swaying arms and torsos.",
    "long": "Some examples of lissome bodies are those of mermaids twisting through the water, small snakes squiggling into sand piles, and men and women who bound up stairs as if they're light as air. A straw is thin and bendy, and you can use it to lift some liquid from a glass. Lissome sounds a little like \"lift some,\" and it's an adjective for thin and flexible people, like a lissome ballerina with a gracefully arched back. Light, lean, liquid in movement — lissome."
  },
  "introspective": {
    "short": "Someone who is introspective spends considerable time examining his own thoughts and feelings. If you take to your diary after an unhappy break-up, you are being introspective.",
    "long": "The Latin word introspicere means to look inside, and that's what an introspective person does, metaphorically speaking. It's different from meditative and pensive in that they can refer to contemplating anything, whereas introspection involves specifically contemplating yourself."
  },
  "relinquish": {
    "short": "If you relinquish something, you let it go. You relinquish control of the army when you resign as general. You relinquish your plan to sneak into town when your parents find out what's going on.",
    "long": "Relinquish is also commonly used to mean physically letting go of something: The monkey wouldn't relinquish its grasp on the banana. Relinquish descends from Latin relinquere, from the prefix re- \"again\" plus linquere \"to leave.\""
  },
  "desecrate": {
    "short": "To desecrate means to treat a sacred place or thing with violent disrespect. The news sometimes reports on vandals who have desecrated tombstones or places of worship.",
    "long": "The word consecrate from the Latin consecrare means \"to make sacred.\" Substituting the prefix con- with de- reverses the meaning. When preparing for a foreign occupation, the military instructs troops not to desecrate sacred sites and risk offending the local population. You can also desecrate someone's memory if you spread malicious lies about him after his death."
  },
  "upheaval": {
    "short": "Upheaval means a violent or sudden change. You might talk about an upheaval in government following an election where many incumbents are replaced.",
    "long": "Upheaval is a geological term for the upward displacement of the earth's crust that has stretched to include a change in power or ideas. If you suddenly found out your favorite teacher was running a pyramid scheme and had escaped to a Caribbean island, you might experience an upheaval in your attitude toward teachers in general."
  },
  "normal": {
    "short": "If something conforms to a general pattern, standard, or average, we describe it as normal, but of course that standard can change over time. What's normal today may be \"abnormal\" in the future.",
    "long": "The word normal comes from a Latin word normalis, which described something made with a carpenter's square. Something built this way would be normed to have angles that were perfectly aligned and fit a general pattern. This meaning eventually gave us the broader sense of fitting a pattern, standard, or average. Doctors like you to be a normal weight for your height, so you may need to grow taller to make your doctor happy."
  },
  "holster": {
    "short": "The noun holster looks like holder and that's exactly what it is. Some holsters hold a single item, like a gun, and others are more like tool belts, holding many small items.",
    "long": "The o in holster is long, so pronounce it like this: \"HOLE-ster.\" Originally, the word described something very specific — a leather case for a pistol. It probably comes from the Old English word heolster (earlier helustr), which means \"concealment, hiding place.\" Today, holsters may hide what they hold, but they always keep things handy."
  },
  "repeat": {
    "short": "You can use the word repeat for things that happen again. You can use the word repeat for things that happen again. When you repeat, you do or say the same thing more than once.",
    "long": "Sometimes you need to repeat what you said because someone didn’t hear it or understand it the first time, and other times you might repeat a statement for emphasis — you say it twice to really get your point across; in some cases you'll get \"I heard you the first time\" in return. Doing something over is another way to repeat, as when you repeat a test or draw a smiley face all over your notebooks in a repeat pattern."
  },
  "parity": {
    "short": "All things being equal, parity means, basically, equality. It’s used in finance, physics, math, and even sports. When people talk about parity in a football league, for example, they mean the teams are evenly matched. Go, evenly matched team, go!",
    "long": "Parity comes from the same Latin root as pair, which is par, for “equal.” Parity is an equal amount of something, or an equal rank or skill level between people or teams. During the Cold War, the word parity was used to describe the equal amount of resources the US and the USSR had. So now it also means an equal amount between enemies, which is probably why sportscasters love it."
  },
  "cosseted": {
    "short": "To cosset is to pamper or spoil. Your mom might cosset her beloved lap dog, feeding him homemade meals and singing him to sleep.",
    "long": "If your parents used to cosset you when you were little, they may have protected you from injury and indulged your every whim. Your temptation might be to cosset small children or elderly relatives, pampering them and shielding them from difficulty. In the 17th century, cosset had the additional sense of \"fondle and caress,\" as you might cuddle a baby or a puppy. Earlier, the word was a noun meaning \"a lamb raised as a pet.\""
  },
  "absolute": {
    "short": "Use absolute as a noun or an adjective when you're so sure of something that you know it will never change. For example, a devout person's belief in life after death is an absolute; that person has absolute faith in the afterlife.",
    "long": "Absolute can also mean \"without any doubt,\" as in the case of an absolute beauty — such as a glamorous movie star or a supermodel — or \"without limits,\" such as a dictator who has absolute power over the people. Or, absolute can describe a final demand that must be met, such as the absolute conditions a person buying a home might present to its seller — it's the last step and can make or break the sale."
  },
  "surmise": {
    "short": "If you see empty ice cream containers on the table, sprinkles littering the ground, and a can of whipped cream in the trash, you can surmise what happened: someone made sundaes. To surmise is to form an opinion or make a guess about something.",
    "long": "If you surmise that something is true, you don't have much evidence or knowledge about it. Near synonyms are guess, conjecture, and suppose. You might say, \"I can't even surmise what he would do in such a situation.\" Surmise came to English from the French surmettre, \"to accuse,\" which is formed from the prefix sur-, \"on, upon,\" plus mettre, \"to put\" (from Latin mittere, \"to send\")."

  "sang-froid": {
    "short": "If you have sang-froid, you can keep your cool, even under stress. Your feathers aren't easily ruffled.",
    "long": "This foreign-sounding word is another way of saying \"poise under pressure.\" We borrowed it from French, where it literally means \"cold blood.\" Great athletes who do well in the last two minutes of a game have sang-froid. James Bond definitely has sang-froid. You better have sang-froid when you're taking the SATs. If you're worried, nervous and starting to crack, you've pretty much lost your sang-froid."
  },
  "arrogant": {
    "short": "Arrogant is an adjective for describing people who are too proud and look down on others, like supermodels who think their good looks give them a right to do whatever they want.",
    "long": "Arrogant derives from Latin arrogare \"to claim,\" and the idea is that someone is claiming credit or advantages that they are not entitled to. It's close in meaning to haughty and supercilious, but both of those have connotations of coolness and perceived superiority that arrogant does not.  An aristocrat could be called all three, but a customs official or traffic cop is more likely to be called arrogant than the other terms."
  },
  "cavern": {
    "short": "A cavern is a large cave or a large chamber in a cave. Or, if your bedroom is very dark, your mother might want you to open the blinds and let some light into that cavern.",
    "long": "The word cavern is a late Middle English word that comes from the Latin root cavus, meaning “hollow.” Cavern typically describes a cave, but it can refer to any large enclosed space, especially a space that's dark like a cave. You might sit in a vast cavern when you go to the opera. Cavern can also be used figuratively — you could explore the dark cavern of your mind."
  },
  "neglect": {
    "short": "Neglect is worse than ignoring something. It's ignoring it, failing to care for it, and probably harming it in the process.",
    "long": "The word neglect comes from the Latin verb neglegere, which means \"disregarded.\" You can neglect to do your chores, meaning fail to do them, but this word is usually reserved for cases when you willingly refuse to care for something appropriately. Child neglect is what parents get charged with when they fail to provide for their child's basic needs. If you go on vacation and neglect your plants, they may wither and die due to your lack of attention."
  },
  "repugnance": {
    "short": "Repugnance means strong distaste for something. If you love animals, you probably feel repugnance for people who mistreat their horses.",
    "long": "The word repugnance comes from Latin root words, re, meaning back, and pugnare,  to fight. When we use repugnance, we don't just mean the feeling of fighting back or resisting, but also a feeling of horror or sickness that causes you to resist in the first place. If something grosses you out, you feel repugnance for it. Repugnance can also express a feeling of moral horror: you probably feel repugnance at photographs of torture."
  },
  "inopportune": {
    "short": "Since the meaning of \"opportune\" is \"favorable\" or \"well-timed,\" it's easy to guess that the meaning of inopportune means something that is ill-timed or inappropriate. That little prefix in- means \"not,\" and it totally turns the meaning of a word around.",
    "long": "Think of the Latin word opportunus, which means \"fitting\" or \"opportune.\" When you add in- in front of it, or any word, you give the word the opposite meaning. That's the history of the word inopportune, which has been used since the early 16th century to describe something that is \"not fitting.\" For example, \"She opened the door at an inopportune moment and saw him fire the gun.\" Bad timing? You bet. And very inopportune."
  },
  "renegade": {
    "short": "A renegade is a person who has deserted their cause or defied convention; they're rebels and sometimes outlaws, or even traitors.",
    "long": "A long, long time ago, a renegade was a Christian person who decided to become Muslim. That definition is pretty outdated, as these days a renegade is anyone who breaks laws or expectations to do their own thing or join the other side. It might sound kind of cool to be a renegade, like some rogue action hero. But in general, renegade actions are frowned, not smiled, upon."
  },
  "procure": {
    "short": "In prison movies, there's always a character who is able to procure all sorts of contraband from the inside — magazines, playing cards, special soap. If you procure something, you get it or bring it about by special effort.",
    "long": "Procure's synonym obtain is a little formal, but less formal than procure itself. The noun procurement commonly refers to the obtaining of materials and supplies. Procure descends from Middle English procuren, from Old French procurer, \"to take care of,\" from Latin prōcūrāre, formed from the prefix prō-, \"for\", plus cūrāre, \"to care for.\""
  },
  "solicit": {
    "short": "Solicit means to ask for. It is what those people on the street are doing, when they ask, \"Do you have a moment to talk about the destruction of the planet?\" They are soliciting donations for their cause.",
    "long": "Solicit has an official sounding impressiveness to it––doesn't soliciting donations sound better than begging for money? It can also have a more sinister cast. \"When the teacher left the room, two girls solicited their friends to throw all the textbooks out the windows, injuring members of the cheer squad below — where they were soliciting signatures for a petition banning smoking in the football locker rooms.\""
  },
  "civil": {
    "short": "Civil has several meanings. The simplest is cultured and polite, as in someone who is civilized.  Civil can also describe things related to a community of people and their government, or a civilization.",
    "long": "If you work for the post office, you're a civil servant. The Civil Rights movement focused on the notion that all American citizens were entitled to the same basic personal rights and freedoms. Civil wars are named in reference to the fact that conflict occurs between citizens of the same country, and civil law is similarly limited to non-criminal issues that community members have with each other. The Latin root, civilis, means both \"relating to a citizen\" and \"courteous.\""
  },
  "drudgery": {
    "short": "If you’ve ever had to do the laundry, wash the dishes, make the meals, change the bedding, vacuum the house, and clean the bathrooms day after day, you’ve experienced drudgery. Drudgery is hard, mindless, backbreaking work.",
    "long": "When you say the word drudgery, you can almost feel the hard, plodding work that it describes. You have to put some effort into saying the dr- sound. Then, as soon as you get through the breathy -u-, you’ve got two more hard sounds in -dg- and -er- before you get another break with the final vowel sound. Just as you might drag yourself doing those repetitive, grinding chores, you have to drag your way through pronouncing the word."
  },
  "dictum": {
    "short": "\"You are what you eat\" is a dictum, and so is a law requiring you to curb your dog. A dictum is a formal pronouncement, a rule, or a statement that expresses a truth universally acknowledged.",
    "long": "Dictum dates from the 16th Century. It descended from a Latin word that means \"something said.\" In contemporary use, it means more like \"something that is officially said.\" If the principal of your school issues a dictum declaring \"no jeans in school,\" it's time to go shopping."
  },
  "cognizant": {
    "short": "If you are cognizant of what's going on at the table behind you in the lunchroom, that means you know they're plotting to throw peas at your head. If you are cognizant of something, you are aware of or informed about it.",
    "long": "This 19th century adjective derives from Latin cognōscere, \"to learn.\" For the English adjective and noun, an older pronunciation with a silent g was in use in legal contexts up until the early 20th century. In law, these terms refer to jurisdiction, or the right of a court to hear a case."
  },
  "bolster": {
    "short": "When you cheer up a friend who's feeling down, you bolster them. To bolster is to offer support or strengthen.",
    "long": "A bolster is also the name of a long pillow you might use to make your back feel better. And the two uses are not dissimilar. When you bolster your friends, you support them and prop them up, just like the pillow does for your back. When you're trying to bolster your credibility, you find people and/or documents that support you or your view. Bolster efforts to learn this word!"
  },
  "appalled": {
    "short": "Appalled is an adjective that describes feeling shocked and disappointed. Being appalled happens suddenly, like when you find out your little sister has been blogging about your family, telling embarrassing stories.",
    "long": "Appalled comes from the Latin word pallescere, meaning \"to grow pale\" — the kind of shock that drains the color from your face. When you are appalled, you don't just disapprove of what you are seeing; you are emotionally disturbed by it, like being appalled by the wasted food at a cafeteria or restaurant or the rudeness of someone who lets the door slam in your face."
  },
  "caustic": {
    "short": "Use the adjective caustic to describe any chemical that is able to burn living tissue or other substances, or, figuratively, a statement that has a similarly burning effect. Caustic in this sense means harshly critical.",
    "long": "In the chemical sense, a near synonym is corrosive. In the figurative sense, near synonyms are biting, scathing, and sarcastic. The source of the word caustic is Latin causticus, from Greek kaustikos, from kaiein \"to burn.\""
  },
  "espouse": {
    "short": "Use the verb espouse to describe the actions of someone who lives according to specific beliefs, such as your friends who espouse environmentalism and as a result walk whenever possible instead of taking the car.",
    "long": "You can see the word spouse in espouse, so you may be wondering what husbands and wives have to do with it. Originally espouse did mean \"to marry,\" but its meaning has evolved to include other long-term commitments as well, such as support for a principle or a cause. Similar to marriage, if you espouse a belief system, the idea is that you've chosen to wed yourself to it."
  },
  "smother": {
    "short": "To smother is to overwhelm or suffocate. If you've ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend who calls you twenty five times an hour to check up on you, then you know what it means to be smothered by someone.",
    "long": "The word smother literally means to deprive of oxygen, so it can be used to refer to someone who gets suffocated by a pillow. In everyday conversation, the word is often used to refer to the act of making someone feel like they’re being deprived of oxygen or personal space. If you have a mother who likes to smother you by asking where you're going every time you see her, then it's likely you’re already dreaming of moving out!"
  },
  "jaded": {
    "short": "If you've done something so much that it doesn't excite you anymore but just leaves you tired, consider yourself jaded. If someone says you look a little jaded, it just means that you look tired.",
    "long": "The history of jaded is not clear, but perhaps it is related to the noun jade, an old term for a worn-out horse. Even if not, picturing a tired old horse may be a nice way to remember that jaded means dulled or tired from too much of something. The word can also mean cynical because of bad experiences with something, like a jaded journalist who doesn't see the person behind the politician."
  },
  "impunity": {
    "short": "If doing something usually results in punishment, but you do it with impunity, you will not be punished for the deed. Students are not allowed to chew gum in school, but teachers do it with impunity. Not fair!",
    "long": "The noun, impunity, comes from the Latin roots im- (\"not\") plus poena (\"punishment\"), a root which has also produced the word pain. Impunity, then, is the freedom from punishment or pain. If someone has committed a punishable offense but does not have to fear punishment, he or she does it \"with impunity.\" Cybercriminals operate with impunity in some countries."
  },
  "pathos": {
    "short": "Pathos is a quality that stirs emotions. A song with a lot of pathos hits you right in the heart.",
    "long": "You ever notice how some songs or movies appeal to your brains, while others appeal to your feelings? The ones that are all about feeling are full of pathos, an appeal to emotions that originally meant \"suffering\" in Greek. Often, this word has to do specifically with pity and sympathy: when someone tells a story about people suffering that makes you feel for them, that's pathos."
  },
  "detour": {
    "short": "A detour is a longer, less direct way to get where you're going. A traffic accident sometimes means you have to take a detour to get home.",
    "long": "When signs direct drivers to take a detour, it's usually because of road work or an emergency that's blocking traffic. You can also detour, or take an unexpected route, while you're running errands, stopping at your favorite bakery for a cookie before you continue on. The French détour comes from the verb destorner, \"turn aside.\""

  "aggrandize": {
    "short": "If you are a window washer, but you refer to yourself as a \"vista enhancement specialist,\" then you are aggrandizing your job title — that is, making it sound greater than it is.",
    "long": "The verb aggrandize not only means \"to make appear greater\"; it can also be used to mean simply \"to make greater.\" If you buy an estate and sink millions of dollars into its improvement, then you are actually aggrandizing the estate. If you are making yourself seem greater, then people may say you are \"self-aggrandizing.\""
  },
  "echelon": {
    "short": "An echelon is a stepped formation with objects arranged in a diagonal. Birds flying in a V shape create echelons so that they can draft behind each other and conserve energy — except for the guy up front, who’s super tired.",
    "long": "Echelon patterns are often used by the military, with rows of tanks, troops, or aircraft arranged behind and to the left or behind and to the right of the row ahead. Echelon can also refer to a particular level or rank in a group or society. If you win the Olympics, you’ve reached the upper echelon of athletics. If you win a hot dog eating contest . . . Well, you reached a pretty low echelon of athletics."
  },
  "fallacy": {
    "short": "A fallacy is a misleading argument or belief based on a falsehood. If you oppose state testing in schools, you think it is a fallacy that educational quality can be measured by standardized tests.",
    "long": "Fallacy comes from the Latin fallacia, for deceit. It technically means a flaw in an argument that makes it deceptive or misleading. In poetry, the \"pathetic fallacy\" is the false idea that things like rocks or stars have human feelings (pathos). Fallacy can also be used more generally for any false statement or idea. Some synonyms are misconception and error."
  },
  "axiom": {
    "short": "An axiom is a statement that everyone believes is true, such as \"the only constant is change.\" Mathematicians use the word axiom to refer to an established proof.",
    "long": "The word axiom comes from a Greek word meaning “worthy.” An axiom is a worthy, established fact. For philosophers, an axiom is a statement like “something can’t be true and not be true at the same time.” An example of a mathematical axiom is “a number is equal to itself.” In everyday usage, an axiom is just a common saying, but it’s one that pretty much everyone agrees on."
  },
  "graft": {
    "short": "Graft can mean bribery or corruption. It's also a way of transplanting skin or bones in medicine, as in a skin graft.",
    "long": "People who get terrible burns on their faces often have pieces of skin taken from other parts of their bodies to help them heal and look better. That transplanted skin is called a graft. There are also grafts in agriculture, when farmers take a branch from one tree and graft it onto another tree. The most common use of graft is in political corruption cases when politicians are accused of taking money in exchange for granting favors."
  },
  "profound": {
    "short": "When you need a word that's deeper than \"deep,\" consider profound. A philosopher is likely to make many profound pronouncements.",
    "long": "Profundus literally means \"deep\" in Latin, and profound had the same meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it also meant \"figuratively deep\" — that is, very great or intense: \"The new laws have had a profound impact.\" Of people, it means \"very knowledgeable or insightful,\" but sometimes when a person tries to sound profound, they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed up with big words."
  },
  "incommensurate": {
    "short": "If one thing is incommensurate with another, it doesn't fit or is out of proportion. If your expensive meal doesn't taste very good, you could say its quality is incommensurate with its cost.",
    "long": "Things that are incommensurate just don't match — they're disproportionate or off-kilter. Your little brother's loud mouth might be incommensurate with his tiny size, and your small appetite could be incommensurate with the enormous banana split in front of you. The commensurate part of this word comes from the Late Latin commensuratus, literally \"measured with,\" or \"equal,\" and the prefix in- means \"not.\""
  },
  "ingenious": {
    "short": "Something ingenious shows creativity and inventiveness. If someone compares you to Einstein, they're implying that you, too, are ingenious.",
    "long": "Ingenious comes from the Latin  words for inborn talent. It started off meaning someone who was talented or incredibly smart, but has come to mean inventive, or clever. If you could calculate how long a given water supply would last during a drought in your head, people might call you a math genius. But if can come up with a solution to solve all water shortage issues during a drought, you will be praised as ingenious. Ingenious can also describe an object, like an ingenious device."

  "delete": {
    "short": "The author looked at the computer screen in horror. With one keystroke she had deleted  her entire manuscript. Delete means to erase.",
    "long": "Delete has its roots in Latin and was first used to mean destroy. In modern usage, delete means to remove completely. Delete used in writing means to edit by removing, often done by drawing a line through the text to be deleted . This process is also called “blue-penciling,” due to the use of the blue colored pencil that some editors use."

  "imminent": {
    "short": "Something that is imminent is just about to happen: if you light a firecracker and then stick it down your pants, a very bad situation is imminent.",
    "long": "Imminent is from Latin imminere, \"to overhang,\" and to say that something is imminent is to say that it is hanging over you and about to fall, in a metaphorical way. If you take your mom’s car and drive it into the mailbox, getting grounded is imminent. You don’t want that hanging over your head!"
  },
  "abase": {
    "short": "To abase something or someone is to humiliate them — no, more than just humiliate them. If you abase another person you are bringing them low, humbling them in a mean, base manner. Not nice at all.",
    "long": "Abase means to bring someone down, often either in their job or their self-esteem. The early Latin bassus, which meant \"thick, low,\" evolved into the Old French abaissier, meaning \"to make lower in value or status.\" The important clue to the word is \"base.\" Consider that the base of anything is the bottom, and you get an idea as to the meaning of the word abase, which means to make someone feel low."
  },
  "grill": {
    "short": "Not all grilling involves fire and delicious food.  Sometimes, to grill means to ask a person really intense questions, like when you suspect them of doing something wrong and you want to make them confess the truth.",
    "long": "Ever seen a film where a police officer puts a bright light in a criminal’s face and screams, “Did you do it?”  That’s how you grill someone. You have to be tough on him, and not let him off the hook too easily. Being grilled means you are in the “hot seat,” and it’ll feel like you’re cooking from such a close examination.  Better to grill than be grilled, but if you get caught — think of an alibi, quick!"
  },
  "verify": {
    "short": "When you verify something, you show that it's true. Do you have a photograph to verify your claim that there's a dinosaur in your backyard?",
    "long": "Physical evidence and records are often used to verify what's happened. Your receipt verifies that you purchased the tall, striped hat you'd now like to return. You can also verify something verbally. Can you verify that your cat was home all evening on the night of the canary's \"accident\"?"
  },
  "compelling": {
    "short": "Compelling means attractive, or irresistible, or really, really convincing. You know your argument for backpacking across Europe is compelling when your parents not only let you go but also pay for all your expenses.",
    "long": "To compel is to drive or force into action –– the way the fear of being grounded might compel you to come home before your curfew. A compelling argument compels you to agree with its logic –– it's irresistible. If you decide to run for class president, you'll need to write a compelling speech about why students should vote for you."

  "harbinger": {
    "short": "A harbinger is something that comes before and that shows what will follow in the future. The robin is a harbinger of spring — its presence means spring is coming soon.",
    "long": "The appearance of a ghost is often thought of as a harbinger of death. Middle English herbergere is from Old French herbergeor, \"host,\" from herberge, \"camp, shelter,\" a word ultimately borrowed from a Germanic language."
  },
  "transcribe": {
    "short": "If someone asks you to transcribe something, they want you to listen to it and write down what was said, word for word. Speeches, interviews, and trials are often transcribed for records.",
    "long": "From the Latin transcribere, which means “to copy, write over, or transfer,” the verb transcribe means just that: to write out a copy. You might want to transcribe a recording of an interview onto paper, or maybe you need to transcribe all the notes you collected from an important meeting. If you can remember that trans means “over” and that a scribe is a writer, you shouldn’t forget this word. Fun fact: to transcribe poorly is to transcribble."
  },
  "somatic": {
    "short": "Somatic is a fancy word that just means dealing with the body. You may be tired of hearing your great-grandfather's somatic complaints, but give him a break - his body has been working for 80 years!",
    "long": "Soma means body in Latin, so somatic means of the body and is most often used in connection with one's health. You may be more familiar with the related word, psychosomatic, which describes a physical condition or illness caused by the mind rather than a virus or a sprain. If you don't want to go to school so much that you begin to feel sick, that is psychosomatic. But sometimes, your somatic symptoms mean you really do have a cold!"
  },
  "parry": {
    "short": "Sword fighters thrust and parry. To thrust is to try to stab, and to parry is to avoid getting stabbed by blocking a thrust. Though it comes from fencing, parry is also handy in dodgeball and awkward conversations",
    "long": "The word parry means to block or evade a movement, like in fencing, but it can also refer to an evasion that is verbal rather than physical. If someone asks you who you have a crush on, but you don’t want to answer, parry the question — change the subject or ask a question in return. When used in this way parry retains its sense of defending yourself through evasion."

    "long": "When someone deliberately tries to make another person feel intimidated or threatened, it's an act of aggression. Forceful, unfriendly behavior towards others is one example of aggression, and one country's hostile action toward another is also a kind of aggression. It's been used since the 1600s to mean \"an unprovoked attack,\" from the Latin root word aggressionem, \"attack,\" and in 1912 aggression was first used to mean generally \"hostile behavior.\""

  "gaffe": {
    "short": "A gaffe is a mistake that embarrasses you in front of others. If you run into a friend out with her grey-haired father, and you blurt out, \"Oh, hi, you must be Tara's grandfather!\" then you've made a gaffe.",
    "long": "Gaffe rhymes with laugh, and you'll be lucky if that's how people respond to your social blunder. A gaffe seems to occur most often when you literally don't know your audience — you make a joke about the mayor; you didn't know you were talking to his sister. That's definitely a gaffe. And who knew your hosts come from a culture that takes offense if you refuse to try every dish?"

    "long": "This informal all-purpose term can be used to describe anything that doesn’t quite fit in. The adjective quirky is often used to describe those unconventional things that are characterized by peculiar behavior or an unexpected point of view. Quirky is often used to describe people, but it can also refer to things that seem to possess an unexpected and unconventional element, like a quirky strategy or a quirky idea."

If you take up pugilism, you'll learn the footwork to use in a ring, and how to hold your gloves to protect your body and punch your opponent.

    "long": "You might recognize the prefix omni-, meaning \"all,\" from words like omnipotent (\"all-powerful\") or omniscient (\"all-knowing\"). Add it to present, and voilà, you have a word for something that's present all the time. You can't hide from an omnipresent being, and you can't escape an omnipresent smell.

Animals generally don’t care what their collars look like. When it's a verb, collar means \"apprehend\" or \"arrest,\" as when a police detective finally collars an elusive bank robber.

A cat at a dog's birthday party would be an incongruity, as would a pacifist at a meeting of the War Lovers' Society. Incongruity is the idea that something is incongruous, or inappropriate.

So it makes sense that the word's history goes back to that date, from the Afrikaans word for \"separateness.\" It comes from the Dutch, with the \"heid\" part meaning \"hood,\" for \"apart-hood.\" The word is pronounced \"apart-hate,\" which is also an apt description for a policy that brutally oppressed an entire people based solely on their skin color. The system was ended in 1993."

Sometimes a milieu shapes a person, as when a \"milieu of abuse and poverty,\" inspires someone to improve things for others. Milieu sounds a lot like mildew without the \"d,\" but unless you grew up in a moldy bathtub, mildew probably has little to do with your milieu, or environment."

As an intransitive verb, it is often used with something physically, emotionally, or figuratively violent, as in \"the flood of fan mail began to abate.\" Using it transitively, if you take measures to abate pollution or noise, you reduce them. Pronounce abate with the stress on the second syllable (uh-BATE)."

    "long": "Whenever you see the suffix -cracy, you know you're dealing with a form of rulership or government. The first part of the word comes from the Greek ploutos, meaning wealth. Put them together, and you get plutocracy, a government ruled by the rich. How does this differ from, say, an aristocracy? Well, the truth is that it isn't very different. Members of the aristocracy tend to be rich, but their money tends to be \"old money.\" In a pure plutocracy, even the overnight billionaire can be a ruler."

  "primal": {
    "short": "The adjective primal describes something that's essential or basic, like the primal urge to protect yourself and your family from harm.",

You can think of this as a first priority, just as the primal urges of all animals is survival. Primal can also describe something that's original, or at its earliest stage, like a primal or primeval forest, the most ancient example of that kind of terrain."

  "antiseptic": {
    "short": "If you are out to kill some microorganisms, an antiseptic will come in handy! If you go to a hospital for a cut on your arm, the nurse will apply an antiseptic to the wound because it will kill any bacteria, while not harming your healthy skin.",
    "long": "Antiseptic is also an adjective that describes the state of being clean and without disease-causing bacteria: \"The antiseptic wash the nurse splashed over your arm was bright blue and smelled funny, but it kept your wound free of infection.\" Antiseptic can also describe something that is clean in a different way — as in, free of any objectionable language. A comedian's jokes could be so antiseptic that even your grandmother would like them."

  "felicity": {
    "short": "Felicity is a state of happiness or the quality of joy. Sitting on the roof with a telescope and iced tea on a clear, starry night is one way to find perfect felicity — a happy place.",

  },
  "quisling": {
    "short": "A quisling is a traitor, especially one who collaborates with an enemy occupying force for personal gain.",
    "long": "The term arose because in World War II, Vidkun Quisling, a Norwegian politician, volunteered to help the occupying Nazis rule Norway for Germany. Quisling was tried for treason and executed at the end of the war, and his name became synonymous with traitor and collaborator. The word quisling is not commonly used in the United States, however, probably because the American term for a traitor is \"Benedict Arnold,\" the name of a Revolutionary War turncoat."

  "lyrical": {
    "short": "Something that's lyrical is beautifully full of emotion. Don't be surprised if a lyrical passage in the book you're reading makes you cry a little bit.",
    "long": "The word lyric, and its connection to the words of a song, provides one hint about the adjective lyrical, which can mean \"appropriate for singing.\" When a movie, book, dance, or work of art gives you the same feeling as the most beautiful music, you can also describe those things as lyrical. The musical connection goes all the way back to the Greek root word, lyra, or lyre."
  },
  "divergent": {
    "short": "Something divergent is moving away from what is expected. Two divergent paths are moving in opposite directions — away from each other.",
    "long": "Things that are divergent are diverging — moving away from a path or a standard. A teacher who comes to work in a clown outfit is being divergent; a clown who comes to work in a business suit is also being divergent. A stream is divergent if it is moving in the opposite direction of a river. A politician who is divergent might leave his political party. Divergent people and things are changing course — moving off the beaten path."

  "obloquy": {
    "short": "If you are on the receiving end of obloquy, then society has turned against you and you are in a state of disgrace. Poor Hester Prynne who was forced to wear a red \"A\" on her chest for \"adultery\" knows all about obloquy.",
    "long": "If you break the word obloquy into its two Latin roots, you have ob, meaning “against” and loqui, meaning \"to speak\" — so obloquy means “to speak against,\" in an especially mean way. Obloquy can also be the result of public shame, or criticism. Sometimes obloquy takes the form of offensive or rude language: \"It's not easy, but I've found it's best to ignore my sister's obloquy when I beat her in Monopoly.\""

Another way that scientists mutate organisms is in food production: often the genes in a plant are changed in a way that helps it resist insects or weeds, or makes it grow much larger than normal. The Latin root word of mutate is mutare, which simply means \"to change.\""

  "turpitude": {
    "short": "If you are guilty of turpitude, you should be ashamed of yourself. Turpitude is a word that represents depraved behavior. Prisons are filled with criminals who have engaged in acts of moral turpitude.",
    "long": "Turpitude comes from the Latin word turpitudo, which means \"repulsiveness.\"  Corrupt politicians get booted out of office for acts of turpitude, like taking bribes in exchange for lucrative government contracts. Turpitude often follows the word moral, and acts of moral turpitude are usually crimes that are unusually sick or corrupt."
  },
  "decipher": {
    "short": "Decipher means translate from code, or more generally, figure out. If you can’t decipher your teacher's writing, it means you can't read it. You might feel like you're being asked to decipher a code.",
    "long": "During World War II, the Nazis used a machine called the Enigma to encode secret messages. An operator would type the message with a keyboard, which would activate a set of rotors, giving each letter a different value. The code was difficult for the Allies to crack, but eventually the code was deciphered by the British, hastening the end of the war."
  },
  "prone": {
    "short": "If you're prone to doing something, it means you're likely to do it, have a habit of doing it, or are susceptible to it. People who are prone to getting the flu every winter should probably get a flu shot in the fall.",
    "long": "The second meaning of prone is \"lying face down,\" and the Latin root is pronare, \"to bend forward.\" This is a handy way to remember both meanings: if you tend to wait to start your term paper until the night before it's due, you are prone to procrastination — you bend toward it.  If you stay up so late you fall asleep face down in the book, you are now prone at your desk."

    "long": "In describing a place, stark means \"providing no shelter or sustenance.\" A barren desert or a room with no furniture or curtains is stark. It can also mean \"severe, stern, or austere,\" like the stark beauty of the rocky cliffs in the west of Ireland. Stark can also be used to mean \"totally.\" If you are called stark, raving mad, there's no question about it: you are acting completely crazy."
  },
  "discomfit": {
    "short": "To discomfit someone is to make them feel uncomfortable or upset. An easy way to discomfit another person is to use the age-old, childish trick of ignoring them. (Of course, we’re sure you would never do that, right? Right?)",
    "long": "If you make someone blush, sweat, and generally want to disappear, you’ve discomfited her. Centuries ago, discomfit was used to mean “destroy completely in battle” — an experience that surely left the defeated armies feeling something more than mere discomfort. Some scholars have suggested that the contemporary meaning of discomfit arose due to confusion with the word discomfort. Don’t be discomfited by choosing the wrong word; use this word to mean “embarrass.”"
  },
  "champion": {
    "short": "A champion is a winner, or someone who's really good at something. If you are a champion chess player, you are a superstar! When crowds sing Queen's \"We Are the Champions\" at football games, they are celebrating the fact that their team won.",
    "long": "Champion comes from the Latin word campionem for \"gladiator, fighter.\" Rarr! No need to grab your sword, but a champion is also a person who fights for a cause. If you are the champion of fundraising, you keep pushing to raise money. As a verb, to champion means to protect or fight for something. You champion your little brother by defending him against meanies — no matter what, you are always on his side."
  },
  "wanting": {
    "short": "If something's wanting, there's not enough of something necessary in it. If your essay is wanting, it's missing something important and won't get an A. Try adding body paragraphs.",
    "long": "If you forget the sugar in your chocolate chip cookies, you'll find them wanting when you taste them. Likewise, if your favorite team's defense is wanting, they're likely to lose the basketball game. Wanting, which was originally wantand, comes from the verb want, \"to be lacking.\" This definition pre-dated the now more common \"to wish for\" by 500 years."
  },
  "pellucid": {
    "short": "A sentence that teaches a new vocabulary word should always be pellucid, that is, its style and meaning should be easily understandable so that you can derive the definition from the sentence.",
    "long": "You may have heard the word lucid, which means clear. Both lucid and pellucid derive from a Latin word that means \"to shine through.\" Pellucid water is clear, a pellucid sky is a particularly intense shade of blue, pellucid prose is writing that's easy to understand, and pellucid singing is clear and light in tone."
  },
  "abyss": {
    "short": "The noun abyss refers to a deep void or chasm — either literal or figurative. Making a momentous life decision with great uncertainty, like enrolling in clown college, might feel like jumping into the abyss.",
    "long": "Traditionally, the abyss referred to the \"bottomless pit\" of Hell. Now it might refer to either a literal chasm or a figurative one: \"Thirty years ago, we peered into this abyss and pulled back just in time.\" The word is sometimes used to describe a wide difference between cultures or nations. Abyss comes from Greek: a- \"without\" + byssos, \"depth, bottom.\" You may know the related adjective abysmal, which means \"appallingly bad\" — or \"way down in the depths,\" as it were."
  },
  "amiable": {
    "short": "A friendly, pleasant person could be described as amiable. Airline flight attendants tend to be amiable. The people monitoring the school's cafeteria? Maybe not.",
    "long": "An amiable person is good-natured and easy to get along with. Add one letter and you get amicable, a word with a common ancestor (Latin amicabilis) and a similar meaning. But while amiable refers to friendly people, amicable refers to friendly relations between them; two amiable people who no longer want to be married to one another might have an amicable divorce."
  },
  "extraneous": {
    "short": "Extraneous means coming from the outside, like the extraneous noise you hear when you're in a theater and a train passes by. Extraneous can also mean not relevant or essential, like all the extraneous information in your long-winded science report.",
    "long": "In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary \"outside the ordinary,\" or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.' (Bonus points––ding! ding!––if you knew that terra is Latin for \"earth.\") The meaning of extraneous also extends to more abstract things that come from the outside: extraneous details are ones that don't matter."
  },
  "erudition": {
    "short": "If you've read shelves of thick books, people might describe you as a person of erudition.  You might find erudition to be its own reward, but if you can make a career of it, even better!",
    "long": "The Latin root of erudition is the verb erudire which means \"to teach or train.\"  By showing erudition, you show that you've learned a lot.  If you write with erudition, your readers will  know that you are a serious scholar, as long as you're not too far over their heads."

  "justify": {
    "short": "To justify is to make excuses for one's actions, like the dieter who has to justify the few tiny pieces of chocolate she's sneaked in between salads.",
    "long": "Anyone who has ever made excuses for his or her actions knows the meaning of justify, like the bank robber who justifies his latest heist by claiming he needs the bank's money to support his charitable foundation. He might think he's got a good reason for holding up the bank, but he's going to have a hard time convincing the bank's owner of his reason, or justification. To justify a line of text is to space it so that it lines up with the margin."
  },
  "commensurate": {
    "short": "The word commensurate has to do with things that are similar in size and therefore appropriate. Many people think the death penalty is a commensurate punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime.",
    "long": "When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison — that penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word commensurate is usually followed by with or to; one thing is commensurate with or to another."
  },
  "conservative": {
    "short": "If you are conservative, you aren’t necessarily a card-carrying member of the Republican party (though you might be); it means you resist change.",
    "long": "Conservative has the word conserve in it, which means \"to hold on to, or save.\" In a drought, you want to be conservative in your water use. If you don’t get paid that much and don’t want to use credit cards, you’d better be conservative with your money. And if you dress in a conservative way, you prefer traditional styles to new trends and fads."
  },
  "rape": {
    "short": "Rape is a word for sexual assault. This is one of the worst crimes there is. Rape can also mean to plunder or strip something of resources.",
    "long": "There are few words more powerful than rape, which is a horrifying crime. To rape someone is to force them to have sex with you. This word isn't an obscenity, but its meaning is. There are also some metaphorical meanings, like if a country is said to rape the land of a resource, like oil. Some countries might rape their rain forests by cutting them down. However it's used, rape is a violent and ugly word."
  },
  "augur": {
    "short": "To augur is to predict or indicate. A black cat passing in front of you is said to augur bad luck, but if you love cats you can choose to believe that it augurs good luck instead.",
    "long": "In the past, when you said you would augur the future it meant you would predict it. That form of augur is rarely used today, but the sense of prediction — connected to an object or event — remains. Dark clouds augur a rainstorm. If you skip a dress rehearsal before opening night of a show, it won’t augur well for your performance. The Latin root stems from an ancient Roman religious official who predicted the future from omens."
  },
  "schematic": {
    "short": "Use the adjective schematic to describe a drawing that's very simple and symbolic. That drawing your cousin made of a house with a pointy roof, smiling stick figures, and a round yellow sun? Very schematic.",
    "long": "The word schematic can apply to ideas as well as drawings. In this case, schematic describes an overly simple interpretation of something complex, like a work of literature or a detailed plan for social change. Think of it like the drawing of a boxy house and stick figures, only applied to ideas — it's an outline of something that may not capture all the important details."
  },
  "anguish": {
    "short": "The noun anguish refers to severe physical or emotional pain or distress. A trip to the dentist might cause a cavity-prone person a lot of anguish.",
    "long": "We get this word from a Latin word, angustus, which literally meant \"narrow\" but developed the figurative sense of \"distressed\" — think of being choked off or forced into a small space. In modern times anguish has been in the English with the parallel and related meanings of \"physical torment\" and \"emotional suffering.\" Both kinds might be experienced at the hands of a dentist who likes to make his patients squirm in agony."
  },
  "gratify": {
    "short": "To gratify is to satisfy. Bringing home an A in math would gratify your math tutor. \r\nGratify can also mean to give in. You probably shouldn't gratify your urge to scream in class.",
    "long": "Gratify comes from the Latin gratificari, \"oblige,\" and gratus, \"pleasing.\" The word still carries those meanings. Gratify always takes an object, so you have to gratify something or someone. Gratifying praise will make you feel good about all the work you put in on your science project. Gratify your thirst for vocabulary by using this word correctly!"
  },
  "lavish": {
    "short": "Lavish means \"generous and extravagant\" as an adjective and \"to give generously\" as a verb. If you don't like it when people lavish you with attention, you might appreciate a lavish spread of excellent food instead.",
    "long": "Lavish comes from the Old French lavache meaning \"deluge, torrent,\" referring to rain. When you see it, think of a shower of good things coming down on you as you never use lavish with something bad. Didn't your parents lavish you with praise and love when you were small? With lavish as an adjective, you can rephrase that question like this: Didn't your parents offer you lavish praise and love when you were little?"
  },
  "comity": {
    "short": "The noun comity means a state of civility or courtesy between people, organizations, and nations. It's a hoped-for mutual respect and friendliness, although too infrequently the case in politics and business.",
    "long": "Comity is one of those rare words that has retained its original meaning through the ages. The Latin adjective cōmis, \"courteous, friendly,\" developed into the noun cōmitātem, meaning \"courtesy or friendliness\" and ultimately into English comity in the 16th century. The phrase \"comity of nations,\" coined in 1862, refers to the mutual respect for each other's laws and institutions that encourages a friendly back-and-forth between nations."

  "slapdash": {
    "short": "If you just slapped something together and then dashed when you were done, it was slapdash. The paint job was slapdash: it looked like they did it in an hour, without brushes.",
    "long": "The meaning of the word slapdash is clear from its two parts, slap and dash. If you make something in a slapdash way, you slap it together and then dash away — probably so no one would notice. If you want something to look great and last for a long time, then take your time and do it right. If you do it in a slapdash way, you may save time in the short run. But in the long run, you'll lose much more time redoing your shoddy work."

  "apparition": {
    "short": "If you see something you think might be a ghost, you can call it an apparition to hedge your bets. Apparition doesn't commit you in the same way the word ghost does—and saying that you've seen one won't cause you to be committed.",
    "long": "Deriving from the Latin apparere \"appear,\" apparition was first used in 1520 in a religious context, referring to the moment when the three wise men appear before the infant Jesus in the Bible. Later, apparition came to include the appearance of ghosts, or ghostly figures. It can also mean a memory so vivid it's like seeing a ghost."

  "evolution": {
    "short": "Evolution means the process of developing by gradual changes. A rock star might discuss her evolution as a musician, for example. In biology, evolution refers to genetic change in species or populations over time.",
    "long": "Evolution usually refers to a process that produces a better or more complex form. In biology, it is the natural process by which animals and plants develop from their original or primitive state to their modern or specialized state. This noun is from Latin evolutio, \"an unrolling or opening,\" combined from the prefix e-, \"out,\" plus volvere, \"to roll.\""
  },
  "demeanor": {
    "short": "Your demeanor is defined as being either your facial appearance or your behavior. When playing poker, don't let your demeanor give away how good your cards are.",
    "long": "Demeanor in English today has evolved from Middle English and Old French to refer to the way one manages or presents oneself, and this definition applies to conduct as well as facial expressions. The way you present yourself often affects how others make judgments about you and therefore, you might want your demeanor to reflect the situation you're in. So, if you're at a birthday party, your demeanor should be happy and smiling!"
  },
  "stray": {
    "short": "Little Red Riding Hood strayed from the path and ended up getting eaten by the Big Bad Wolf. When you stray, you wander off without paying attention to where you're going, and sometimes you get in trouble.",
    "long": "Stray can be used as a verb or as a noun. Your attention may stray when you're tired and listening to a very boring lecture. You may be the kind of person who brings home strays, the dogs and cats that have wandered away from their homes and are lost and hungry. When you're organizing your sock drawer and you've got one sock without a mate, you might find the stray sock left behind in the dryer."
  },
  "reproof": {
    "short": "A reproof is a negative comment, reprimand, or rebuke. Even the nicest kindergarten teacher in the world will give his students a reproof if they won't stop laughing and running around the classroom.",
    "long": "An athlete's bad behavior on or off the field might result in a reproof by his coach. and a long-distance bus driver will offer at least a mild reproof if a passenger is continuously talking loudly into her cell phone. Kids with strict parents receive more reproofs than those who have fewer rules to follow. Reproof comes from the Late Latin reprobāre, which means \"disapprove, reject, or condemn.\""
  },
  "crabby": {
    "short": "If you're in a really bad or irritable mood, you can say you're crabby. Loud talking and laughing during a movie might make you crabby.",
    "long": "Some unpleasant, bad-tempered people seem to be crabby all the time, while others just become crabby when they're stuck in rush hour traffic. You might decide that the sound of kids yelling and laughing makes you too crabby to be a good elementary school teacher. The original, 16th century meaning of crabby was \"crooked\" or \"rough,\" with the \"cranky\" meaning arising in the United States around 1776."
  },
  "perquisite": {
    "short": "Perquisites are the benefits or \"perks\" that come along with a job. Free air travel for air hostesses? Free company car for corporate execs? Free pork for politicians? That's right, they're all perquisites.",
    "long": "Not to be confused with prerequisite, which happens about ninety-nine percent of the time. A prerequisite is something that must occur before something else can happen. A prerequisite of getting a job, for example, is passing the interview. Of course, for some people to take a particular job, a prerequisite is that there are suitable perquisites or privileges that come with a particular position."
  },
  "veneration": {
    "short": "Veneration is similar to worship or respect: we feel veneration for things and people we adore and are devoted to completely.",
    "long": "This is a strong word. The main meaning is for a type of religious zeal: if you unquestionably believe in your religion, then you feel and show veneration for your god and beliefs. Also, veneration can apply outside religion when you have enormous respect for something or someone. Great people like Martin Luther King or Mother Theresa inspire veneration. If you feel a combination of awe and love for someone, you are full of veneration."
  },
  "debase": {
    "short": "To debase something is to make it corrupt or impure. If your lemonade stand sells “pure lemonade,” you’d insist on using real lemons instead of a mix; using a mix would debase your product.",
    "long": "Debase is often used in the context of two things: coins and people. To debase a coin is to replace some of the precious metal in the coin with metal of lesser value. To debase a person is to corrupt them, often by driving them to perform an immoral act like (gasp!) using the lemonade mix. Just promise us you won’t do it."
  },
  "staid": {
    "short": "Something that is staid is dignified, respectable — possibly even boring, like a staid dinner party that is heavy on the important guests but light on the laughs.",
    "long": "Staid is pronounced just like \"stayed\" — in fact, it comes from  stay, meaning \"fixed\" or \"permanent.\" Something that is staid is sedate, slightly dull, and tends to stay the same. Whether it’s a middle-class lifestyle, a conservative law firm, your unadventurous aunt, or an old navy plaid sofa, the word staid can be used to describe anything that maintains a respectable self-restraint and takes no chances."

  "frugal": {
    "short": "A person who lives simply and economically can be called frugal. Buying clothes at a consignment shop would be considered frugal. Not getting your mom a gift for her birthday — that's just cheap.",
    "long": "Thrifty, spartan, and prudent are synonyms for frugal, a word that often has positive connotations when used to describe a person who lives a simple life. \"The question for retailers is whether shoppers will remain frugal or slowly resume their old spending habits whenever they get more money in their pockets,\" wrote The Wall Street Journal. You might also speak of \"a frugal meal\" —  a very plain, cheap one. The word is from Latin frux, meaning \"fruit\" (in the sense of \"profit\")."
  },
  "reticent": {
    "short": "Reticent means either quiet or restrained. If you're reticent about your feelings, you like to keep them to yourself, and you're probably quiet in rowdy groups where everyone is talking over each other.",
    "long": "The original meaning of reticent describes someone who doesn’t like to talk. Be careful in your context, however. Reticent can refer to someone who is restrained and formal, but it can also refer to someone who doesn’t want to draw attention to herself or who prefers seclusion to other people. Don’t confuse reticent with reluctant, which means unwilling."
  },
  "cacophony": {
    "short": "A cacophony is a mishmash of unpleasant sounds, often at loud volume. It's what you'd hear if you gave instruments to a group of four-year-olds and asked them to play one of Beethoven's symphonies.",
    "long": "A cacophony is a jarring, discordant mix of sounds that have no business being played together. When the orchestra tunes up before a show, it sounds like a cacophony because each musician is playing a completely different tune, at different times, and at different volumes. Once the show begins, that cacophony had better turn into a melody, or audiences will demand a refund. This allegedly occurred during the first time Igor Stravinsky's score for the ballet \"The Rite of Spring\" was performed because its difficult composition and discordant tone was shocking."
  },
  "prodigal": {
    "short": "Use the adjective prodigal to describe someone who spends too much money, or something very wasteful. Your prodigal spending on fancy coffee drinks might leave you with no money to buy lunch.",
    "long": "Prodigal usually applies to the spending of money. In the Bible, the Prodigal Son leaves home and wastes all his money. The noun forms of the word, meaning \"a wasteful person\" or \"one who returns home after a period of bad behavior,\" relate to this biblical story. You can also use prodigal to describe something that is very abundant or generous, such as prodigal praise. Prodigal comes from the Latin word prodigere, \"to drive away or waste.\""
  },
  "vehement": {
    "short": "You can use the adjective vehement  to describe an extremely strong, powerful, or intense emotion or force. The teenager argued for a much later curfew in a vehement speech to her parents; her parents responded with an equally vehement “No way!”",
    "long": "Vehement is from Latin and was originally applied to intense natural phenomena: pain, heat, wind, etc. It is now more commonly used for intense emotions or beliefs. With the adverb form, people can be vehemently in favor of something, but the more common usage is for people to be vehemently opposed to something. Many people, for example, are vehemently opposed to politicians they didn't vote for, other people spoiling the endings of movies or books, or someone else taking the last piece of chocolate. The stress is on the first syllable (VEE-uh-ment)."
  },
  "paleolithic": {
    "short": "When you're talking about the era when humans hunted and gathered, lived in bands, and made tools out of wood and bone, you can call it paleolithic.",
    "long": "The adjective paleolithic is usually capitalized, since it's the scientific term for a specific period of human history beginning more than two million years ago, up until around the year 10,000 BCE. People sometimes call something paleolithic when it's really, really old. However, when anthropologists talk about the Paleolithic era, they mean the stage when humans truly became human, building homes, tools, jewelry, art, and began to observe rituals and early religious beliefs."
  },
  "plasticity": {
    "short": "Plasticity means \"changeability\" or \"moldability\" — clay has a lot of plasticity, but a rock has almost none.",
    "long": "It helps to think of plastic when learning what plasticity means. See how plastic can be molded into all sorts of things, and even when it's in a totally solid form, it's not hard like stone? Plasticity refers to things that can still change their shape or function. The brain is something with high plasticity: if you have a brain injury, other parts of the brain can change to pick up the slack. Anything that is capable of evolving or being reshaped has plasticity."
  },
  "phony": {
    "short": "Whether you're talking about your attitude, a gigantic diamond, or that obnoxious guy's claims that he knows everything about quantum physics, you can use phony to say that something’s not real.",
    "long": "Use the adjective phony to describe anything that’s fake. If you’re making phony money in the basement, you’ll be in trouble if you get caught using it. Phony has a noun version with a similar meaning. If you say someone or something is a phony, then you’re saying it isn’t what it pretends to be. Someone who’s a phony isn’t sincere, like your classmate who pretended to be your best friend just to try to steal your boyfriend."
  },
  "celerity": {
    "short": "While it looks a lot like celery, celerity means something that vegetables are not — fast moving. Gossip often travels with celerity, as do children trying to get to a big plate of cookies.",
    "long": "When you see the word celerity, think accelerate, like a car when you step on the gas. Both words share the Latin root celer which means swift. You may want to study for exams with celerity, but using a slower, more methodical approach will often yield better results."
  },
  "deference": {
    "short": "Sure you wear ripped jeans to school every day, but you don't wear them to your grandmother's house out of deference to her. When you show deference to someone, you make a gesture of respect.",
    "long": "The noun deference goes with the verb defer, which means \"to yield to someone's opinions or wishes out of respect for that person.\" If you and your dad disagree about the best route to the grocery store, you might defer to him, and take his route. You're taking his route out of deference to his opinion and greater experience."
  },
  "industrious": {
    "short": "If someone comments that you are very industrious, they are complimenting you for working hard and tirelessly. You can have the evening to yourself if you're industrious enough during the afternoon to get your homework and chores done.",
    "long": "The word industrious is closely related to the word industry, used for both the quality of being hardworking, “He is a model of industry,” as well as a field of business, \"the construction industry.\" It might help to remember the Industrial Revolution, the time when machinery was introduced to the manufacturing world. If you're industrious, you work as hard as machines do!"
  },
  "commemorate": {
    "short": "To commemorate something means to remember something and by doing so to honor it, as in “We would like to commemorate his many years of past service by presenting him with this lovely gold watch.”",
    "long": "The word commemorate has a pretty clear echo of memory in it, so it can help to keep it in your mind just by noticing that. You might also notice that you’ve seen the word before, either in late-night infomercials or in various advertisements in magazines, when they talk about commemorative plates, or stamps, or coins: little things that are supposed to honor events or people by recalling them to our collective memory."
  },
  "insinuate": {
    "short": "Insinuate means you imply or suggest something that may or may not be true. If you say things seemed to go wrong about the time your brother took over, you insinuate that he had something to do with the decline.",
    "long": "There's another way to insinuate. Suppose you're in line to get into a popular dance club when a celebrity appears, surrounded by a big entourage. If you strike up a conversation with one of the entourage, you may be able to insinuate that you're part of the group and go in with them. Don't feel bad — people have been doing it at least since the 1520s, when insinuate evolved from the Latin word insinuare, meaning \"wind one's way into.\""
  },
  "egocentric": {
    "short": "If you are egocentric, the whole world centers on you and you don't pay much attention to other people.  Are you even listening to me?",
    "long": "Egocentric is a pretty recent word (from the early 20th century) and it quite literally means \"self-centered.\"  Does its recent invention mean that the human race is becoming more egocentric?  If you're concerned about that possibility, maybe you're not as egocentric as I thought."
  },
  "recompense": {
    "short": "Say you loan a few bucks to a friend who is short on cash, and he wins the lottery. Presumably, he'll be able to recompense you, or pay you back what he owes.",
    "long": "If you look closely at recompense, you'll see how similar it is to compensate, which means to make amends for something or to pay. Add the prefix re-, which suggests returning or repeating, and you get the meaning of recompense — paying back or reimbursing financially or otherwise. Recompense is most often used as a verb, but it works as a noun, too. In recompense for throwing peas and screaming, a mother might send a toddler to her room for a time-out."
  },
  "elicit": {
    "short": "When you elicit, you're bringing out a response of some sort. A good comedian elicits a lot of laughs.",
    "long": "Elicit has to do with creating or provoking a response. A great speech will elicit cheers — a bad speech will elicit boos. Teachers try to elicit responses from students. If a friend smiles at you, it will probably elicit a smile of your own. In court, a lawyer might try to elicit mistakes and inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness. In all cases, whatever is elicited is some kind of response."
  },
  "ossify": {
    "short": "Ossify means to become bony. When a baby is born, some of their \"bones\" are actually soft cartilage, which allows for growth. As the child grows, these soft areas ossify into actual bone. The knee cap, for example, begins to ossify between ages 3 and 6.",
    "long": "From the literal \"to become bony\" meaning of ossify, we get the more figurative meaning: to become rigid or hardened. Although you and other young people may be willing to effect social changes, many older voters have ossified in their opinions. Convincing these rigid thinkers that these changes are good for the country will be quite the challenge. If your kids sneak food to their rooms, you may find ossified cheese under the beds. Even mice won't touch that!"
  },
  "onslaught": {
    "short": "Onslaught is a military term that refers to an attack against an enemy. It's safe to say that no one wants to be caught on the receiving end of an onslaught, because there will be lots of danger, destruction and probably death.",
    "long": "One way to help you remember the brutal meaning of onslaught is through the word's English origin, slaught, meaning \"slaughter.\" But onslaught can be used in non-military ways, too. It can mean a barrage of written or spoken communication, like an onslaught of emailed birthday wishes. Taken individually, the birthday wishes are nice but an onslaught is too many, too fast, all at once. Onslaught can also mean a sudden and severe start of trouble. For example, if your office is unprepared for the onslaught of flu season, the entire sales force will be home sick at the same time."
  },
  "inflammable": {
    "short": "Something that is inflammable can be set on fire easily. You dared not light a match after you accidentally spilled gasoline on yourself because you knew you were inflammable.",
    "long": "Inflammable can be a tricky word, since the in- prefix often means \"not.\" But in this case, the in- isn't really a prefix, because the word is built from the verb inflame which means \"to set on fire.\" Some inflammable things might literally go up in flames, but we also use it metaphorically. Someone with a quick temper could be described as \"inflammable,\" and if you fall in love easily, then you have an inflammable heart."
  },
  "wile": {
    "short": "The noun wile is good for describing a particular kind of deviousness, but its plural form is most commonly used.",
    "long": "Your charming brother might use his wiles to talk your parents into loaning him money again and again. You can describe your cousin's knack for getting exactly what he wants through slyness and trickery as his wile. Language experts can only guess about the origin of wile, though many believe it's related to the Old Norse vél, or \"craft.\" Others think there may be a connection with the Old English word for \"wizard,\" wicca."
  },
  "dovetail": {
    "short": "A dovetail is a joint in woodworking where two sides are fitted together with interlocking pieces. You can also use the word dovetail to show how other things fit well together — like how your picnic plans nicely dovetail with the sunny forecast.",
    "long": "A well-made dovetail is a beautiful thing, with wooden projections that slide into notches perfectly, the two sides forming a corner. When things fit this way, you can say they dovetail — they fit easily and work well together. Your plan to dress up as a Jedi knight dovetails well with your brother's Darth Vader costume, for example. Dovetails got their name from the tail feather-like shape of the joint's pieces."
  },
  "myopia": {
    "short": "Myopia is nearsightedness, which means you see things more clearly that are closer to your eye.",
    "long": "You probably suffer from myopia if you walk into the living room and notice the chair in front of you but not the chair ten feet away. If you have myopia, things farther away look out of focus. Also, this can mean narrow-mindedness and intolerance. Due to the first kind of myopia, someone might always hold the menu two centimeters from their eyeballs at restaurants. Due to the second kind, someone might avoid people with different opinions from their own."
  },
  "arrant": {
    "short": "The word arrant intensifies. An arrant criminal is one heck of a criminal. Arrant nonsense is total nonsense.",
    "long": "Do you struggle for adequate superlatives? If so, you might want to add arrant to your arsenal. It can be used to add emphasis to other words, most often negative words. Arrant rudeness is extreme rudeness. Arrant hypocrisy is very hypocritical. An arrant liar is a world-class liar. Arrant has a meaning similar to complete or utter. Like other intensifiers, arrant turns up the volume on another word."
  },
  "pediatrics": {
    "short": "If you're taking a little kid to the doctor, look for a sign that says pediatrics. Physicians who treat children and babies specialize in pediatrics.",
    "long": "Different branches of medicine focus on different groups of people or specific illnesses. While pediatrics is all about young people from birth to their teens, geriatrics, for example, focuses on elderly people. A medical student who specializes in pediatrics will eventually be a pediatrician, or children's doctor. The root of pediatrics is the Greek word for \"child,\" pais."
  },
  "despicable": {
    "short": "Stealing the last piece of food from a starving child goes way beyond mean. It's despicable — a vile and harmful act.",
    "long": "Mean, nasty, and scummy are synonyms of despicable, but they don't fully convey the awfulness of despicable. A man who lies to get a promotion meant for his co-worker would be considered mean. But the despicable man — the one who is so awful and worthless that he deserves to be despised — is the one who burns down the office building and frames his co-worker for it."
  },
  "blasphemy": {
    "short": "Saying offensive things about God or religion is blasphemy. Blasphemy can be used for offensive ideas in other areas too.",
    "long": "If you're saying something bad about a god, or taking the Lord's name in vain, or questioning a religious institution in any way, you could be accused of blasphemy — insulting something sacred. You can use this word in a lot of other ways too. At a meeting of conservatives, a liberal idea could be considered blasphemy (and vice versa). You might even jokingly cry \"Blasphemy!\" if a friend said your favorite ice cream flavor stinks."
  },
  "discursive": {
    "short": "If people accuse you of rambling from topic to topic in your speech or writing, they may say you have a discursive style — with changes in subject that are hard to follow. But it's okay because unicorns are shiny.",
    "long": "The adjective discursive is often used to describe speech or writing that tends to stray from the main point, but the word can also have almost the opposite meaning. Discursive can also be used to describe an argument based on reason instead of intuition: \"Her discursive dissertation on Colonial American women was well-argued and well-reasoned. Her professors were most impressed with her work.\""
  },
  "internecine": {
    "short": "Prepare yourself, because internecine is a gloomy word.  It’s an adjective you’d use to describe a bloody battle where both sides are badly hurt.  On a lighter note, it can also mean a conflict that tears an organization apart.",
    "long": "A combination of the Latin inter- (“among”) and necare (“to kill”), internecine conflicts are full of blood and death, and they end up destroying everyone involved, which sounds fair but also awful.  Many wars are internecine, as are most Shakespearean tragedies and Hollywood action films.  An internecine meeting would be one where everyone gets mad, says really horrible things, and then suddenly leaves, plotting revenge.  It’s probably the last meeting for that group, which might be a good thing."
  },
  "dire": {
    "short": "Dire refers to situations or events that cause great fear and worry. A dire calamity causes much suffering.",
    "long": "If a family is in dire need, they need immediate help. Dire predictions or warnings tell us that a disaster may happen in the future. If you are trapped between the burning building behind you and the high cliffs in front of you, you might describe yourself as being in dire straits."
  },
  "nascent": {
    "short": "The adjective nascent describes the birth or beginning of something, like a civilization, a trend, an idea, or an action. If your idea for a time machine is nascent, it needs a lot more work before you'll be ready to travel to ancient Egypt.",
    "long": "Imagine you’re in the future looking back at the first time you learned the definition of the word nascent. Your nascent efforts to use the word felt awkward, but you quickly felt comfortable with it, especially after you learned how to pronounce it: “NAY-sent.”  Now you use the word all the time!"
  },
  "rejuvenate": {
    "short": "When you make something young again or give it more life and energy, you rejuvenate it. For example, you can often rejuvenate a not-quite-dead plant, bringing it back to health with some water and some TLC.",
    "long": "One way to remember the word rejuvenate is to pick it apart to its heart, the juve. This juve sounds like juvenile — which refers to youth. Add the prefix re, which means \"again,\" and the \"ate\" suffix, which stands for \"do or make.\" Put them all together and you get \"make young again\" — the meaning of rejuvenate. We all want to be younger, as witnessed by all the ads for products that promise to rejuvenate us through special cosmetics or foods or exercise equipment."
  },
  "counterfeit": {
    "short": "A counterfeit is a fake or a forgery. If you painted an uncanny copy of the \"Mona Lisa\" and tried to pass it off as the original, you'd have a counterfeit on your hands.",
    "long": "An exact imitation of anything — a work of art, a ten dollar bill — is a counterfeit, and the act of creating the fake copy is the verb to counterfeit.  You can also describe the forgery using the adjective form of counterfeit: a counterfeit Rolex watch. In Old French, the word contre, \"counter or against\",  together with the word faire, \"to make,\" joined together to mean \"to make in imitation,\" which led to our counterfeit."
  },
  "cubicle": {
    "short": "A cubicle is a small space partitioned off within a larger space for a particular purpose — usually reading or studying. Or just surfing the Internet.",
    "long": "Cubicle comes from the Latin term for a monk's bedroom, cubiculum, which itself is from the word cubare, \"to lie down.\" Back then a monk would probably share it with an illuminated manuscript and a Bible; nowadays the average worker drone has a computer and a bunch of Post-it notes. Still great for sleeping in, though, as long as you don't get caught."
  },
  "volatile": {
    "short": "Watch out when a situation becomes volatile — it is likely to change for the worse suddenly. If you and your best friend have a volatile relationship, you frequently fight and make up.",
    "long": "Volatile from Latin volatilis, \"fleeting, transitory,\" always gives the sense of sudden, radical change. Think of it as the opposite of stable. A person who is volatile loses his or her temper suddenly and violently. A volatile political situation could erupt into civil war. When the stock market is volatile, it fluctuates greatly.  And in scientific language, a volatile oil evaporates quickly."
  },
  "quiescent": {
    "short": "The adjective quiescent means \"being quiet and still,\" like the quiescent moments lying in a hammock on a beautiful summer Sunday.",
    "long": "To be quiescent, pronounced \"qwhy-ESS-ent,\" is to be quiet, resting, which is exactly what its Latin origin quiescens means: In our busy world, it is hard to find a place to be quiescent. It has a second meaning: \"causing no symptoms.\" For example, if a disease is quiescent, you probably won't know you have it. And finally, quiescent can mean \"not activated,\" like quiescent cleaning products that don't get the stains out."
  },
  "avid": {
    "short": "Avid usually means very eager or enthusiastic. If you're an avid reader, it means you read as much as you can, whenever you can.",
    "long": "But this adjective can also mean wanting something so much that you can be thought of as greedy. For example, a person can be avid for success or power. Avid is from French avide, from Latin avidus, from avere \"to desire, crave.\""
  },
  "municipal": {
    "short": "A municipality refers to a village, town, or city that's usually governed by a mayor and council. From this noun, we get the adjective municipal, which you can use to describe something that relates to a town or its government.",
    "long": "Your town's city council may have offices in the municipal building downtown. If you want to fight city hall, that would be the place to go. Municipal also more generally describes anything related to the town or city itself. If you live within the city limits, for example, your house may be hooked into the municipal water supply, but if you live outside the city limits you may have to have your own well."
  },
  "supine": {
    "short": "You can be described as supine when you're lying face up — for example, your favorite yoga poses might be the supine ones. Someone who is very passive or lethargic could also be called supine — for instance, someone might be supine in the face of continuous threats and insults.",
    "long": "The adjective supine comes from a Latin word, supinus, which means “thrown backwards” or “inactive.”  Whenever a person or animal is lying on its back, belly-up, it is supine.  When your hand is open, palm-up, it is also supine.  Supine can even describe a person who gives insufficient resistance, or who is lazy and ineffectual. \"When Jack refused to object to the landlord’s repeated — and gouging — rent increases, he was supine.\""
  },
  "vacillate": {
    "short": "Vacillate means to waver back and forth, unable to decide. You might vacillate between ordering waffles and pancakes at your favorite diner — it’s hard to pick just one when both are so tasty!",
    "long": "Something that vacillates sways or fluctuates, often quite unsteadily. So use this verb to describe the staggering motions of a person who has had too much to drink, as well as the opinions of someone who can’t make up her mind. Synonyms include vibrate, hesitate, and waver. A wise Ethiopian proverb advises, \"Do not vacillate or you will be left in between doing something, having something, and being nothing.”"

    "short": "To exorcise is to cast out a devil or evil spirit, using prayer and other religious tools. You're probably familiar with the name of the person who does this: an exorcist. Don't try to exorcise a demon yourself. Call an exorcist.",
    "long": "One way to remember the word exorcise is that it sounds like \"exercise,\" which means to work out or train your body or mind. Casting out devils is hard work, so be sure to exercise before you exorcise. A boxer doesn't box without exercising first. And an exorcist doesn't exorcise without getting ready first either. The devil is a tough opponent, so you'd better get warmed up before you try to exorcise him from that little girl."

  "impassioned": {
    "short": "If something is impassioned it's filled with or demonstrating intense emotion. Anything can be impassioned — speech, a play, a conversation, a novel, or even you.",
    "long": "Impassioned comes from the Latin word passionem, meaning \"suffering or enduring,\" and originally referred to the suffering of Christ on the cross, known as \"The Passion.\" In other words, impassioned had a sense of trauma and anguish associated with it and only later did it come to describe happier feelings as well. Whatever the emotional feeling behind impassioned, it's still a word that suggests profound feeling and sincerity on behalf of the user."

  "bristly": {
    "short": "Bristly things are spiky or barbed, like a porcupine. When you get an old-fashioned shoe shine, your shoes will be cleaned with a bristly brush.",
    "long": "You can describe a certain type of hair as bristly — if it sticks up in tufts and spikes like a hedgehog's quills. A man's beard stubble is bristly too, and so are spiky bushes and scruffy dogs. Figuratively, if you're bristly, you're cranky and easily irritated: \"He spoke carefully, trying not to upset his bristly grandfather.\""

  "flout": {
    "short": "To flout is to scorn or show contempt for. \"I flout the law and the concept of civilian safety by making a concerted effort to jaywalk every time I cross a street.\"",
    "long": "Oddly enough, when flout came into existence in the 1550s, it had a much different sense to it than it does now; it's believed that it evolved from the Middle English flowten, “to play the flute.\" These days, the verb flout means \"to scorn,\" as in to scorn a law, person, or social norm by defying it. As a noun, it is a contemptuous remark or insult. Wrote William Shakespeare, “Flout 'em, and scout 'em; and scout 'em and flout 'em; Thought is free.”"

  "abash": {
    "short": "Although abash sounds like a big party or what firefighters do to get through a locked door, abash is, in fact, a verb that means you have caused another person to feel awkward, bashful, embarrassed, or ashamed.",
    "long": "To make your best friend feel abashed, you might tell her new boyfriend about the time she... but why would you want to embarrass her? Typically abash is used when something has a shaming effect. You might find yourself saying: “I was abashed by the magnitude of the others’ generosity so I donated twenty thousand more,” but you wouldn’t just use abash in place of embarrass. It would sound strange to warn, “Don’t do that, you’re going to abash yourself!”"
  },
  "apocryphal": {
    "short": "Urban legends — stories about phantom hitchhikers, deep-fried rats, and spider eggs in bubblegum — are classic examples of apocryphal tales. They're told as if they're true, but no one can ever verify their origins or authenticity.",
    "long": "Today, any dubious or unverifiable story may be dismissed as apocryphal. Originally, however, apocryphal was reserved for religious writings that were not included in the Torah or the New Testament of the Bible because the divinity of the texts was not certain. These texts are known as the Apocrypha and are included in the Septuagint (a Greek version of the Hebrew Bible) and the Vulgate (a Latin Bible edited in the 4th century)."

You could include famous authors, editors, poets, critics, and scholars of literature among the collective group known as the literati.

  "aberration": {
    "short": "An aberration is something strange that rarely occurs. An example of an aberration is when the temperature in Minnesota hits 90 degrees in January — it's nice and warm, but it's really strange.",
    "long": "The noun aberration often refers to something that doesn't fit with current moral standards, or is something that shows a mental lack of control. Aberration comes from the Latin word that means \"to wander, go astray.\" Today, you'd say it was an aberration to send little children to work in coal mines and factories and not to school, which was common in the nineteenth century. There's a very old poem called \"The Chimney Sweep\" about a boy who cleans chimneys and is only about five years old!"

  "hilarious": {
    "short": "One person can find a joke a little funny, while someone else might find it downright hilarious. When something is super-funny, it's hilarious.",
    "long": "Hilarious is an adjective that describes a high degree of humor. Things that are funny can cause you to smile or giggle, but when something is hilarious, it causes you to laugh out loud. Of course, what's hilarious to me might not be to you. When I scribbled obscenities on your face while you were asleep? I found that totally hilarious. You? Not so much. Hilarious is also used sarcastically, when something isn't funny at all. Like when you woke up: you glared at me and said \"Hilarious.\""

  "mendacious": {
    "short": "A mendacious person is one who tells lies habitually and intentionally. Don't get stuck at the water cooler or bus stop next to someone you consider mendacious!",
    "long": "People may tell \"white lies\" if they forgot your birthday or really don't like your new haircut, but if you catch someone intentionally manipulating you with a falsehood, that person is just plain mendacious. So think of the most deceptive, insincere, perfidious, duplicitous, false person you've ever met, and then add the word mendacious to that list."

  "annex": {
    "short": "An annex is an extension of or an addition to a building. A small room off of a main room is an annex, and attics are another type of annex.",
    "long": "As a noun, an annex is part of a building or an addition to a main structure, or it can be an attachment, as in \"an annex to the current plans.\" When used as a verb, the word means something a little different. Sometimes annex is used as a nice word for \"take\" or \"grab,\" as when Nazi Germany took the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and added it to their own territory. In order to annex something to what is yours, you have to take it away from someone else."
  },
  "dispense": {
    "short": "To dispense means to give out or distribute something. A school nurse can dispense students' medication and we all can dispense advice.",
    "long": "The word dispense comes from the Old French word dispenser, meaning \"give out.\" You can dispense anything from hand sanitizer to dating advice. When dispense is paired with with it means \"get rid of it\" or \"skip.\" If you dispense with traditional Thanksgiving dishes, you might instead celebrate with pizza, pancakes, tacos — anything but turkey and all the fixings."

  "engrossed": {
    "short": "When you’re engrossed in something, you’re so consumed by it that you don’t notice anything else, like when you’re engrossed in a conversation with that cute girl from your math class.",
    "long": "Use the adjective engrossed to describe someone who is completely absorbed in something, whether it’s a task, a person, or an object. You might be engrossed in a movie that’s so good you just can’t look away, or you can be engrossed in talking to someone — like the girl from math class. Engrossed is often used with “in” — so you’d say you were “engrossed in” a book or “engrossed in” your homework."
  },
  "polemical": {
    "short": "The adjective polemical describes something related to an argument or controversy. To keep the peace, avoid discussing politics at Thanksgiving, which usually deteriorates into a polemical argument with Uncle Bob. Better stick to football or apple versus pumpkin pie.",
    "long": "Polemical is the adjective form of the noun polemic, which itself comes from the Greek word, polemos, meaning \"war.\" Use polemical to describe a controversy or argument that could end up as a huge conflict, because polemical refers to a major disagreement. The word is often used to describe speech and writing — a polemical discussion or a polemical essay — that usually starts a war of words."

  "recalcitrant": {
    "short": "If someone is so pig-headed that he won't budge on an issue, call him recalcitrant. Not that it will make a difference...",
    "long": "Recalcitrant is from Latin calcitrare, meaning \"to kick,\" so someone who is recalcitrant is kicking back against what's wanted of them. Synonyms are unruly, intractable, and refractory, all referring to what is difficult to manage or control. Writers are frequently referring to recalcitrant Democrats and Republicans, since many people are stubbornly loyal to their political parties and unwilling to change."

  "disinterested": {
    "short": "If you can't decide whether to purchase the shirt with orange polka dots or the purple paisley-patterned one, you might seek input from a disinterested, or unbiased, party (who will probably tell you not to buy either one).",
    "long": "Depending on whom you ask, disinterested is either one of the most commonly misused words in the English language, or a perfect example of usage experts and English teachers being way too uptight. While everyone agrees that disinterested can mean “unbiased,” the debate rages on as to whether it can also mean “uninterested” or “indifferent.” Sticklers are vehemently opposed to this secondary meaning. (Of course, you’ll also find the disinterested — or uninterested? — folks who couldn’t care less.)"

  "grain": {
    "short": "When carpenters sand a piece of wood, they \"go with the grain.\" Grain is the texture on piece of wood, which often forms long patterns that show the direction in which the tree grew.",
    "long": "You may have heard someone say \"there's a grain of truth to that\" when referring to an outrageous story that has a tiny bit of truth to it. A grain can also be a speck or a particle — the tiniest bit of something. Don't confuse this with another definition of grain, the kind you find in your bread — wheat, oats, alfalfa, and so on. Check out all the grains in the ten-grain bread next time you're in the bakery!"

  "imbecile": {

Its origins are in the Latin word imbecille, \"weak or feeble,\" and it was an official medical term for people with a specific (and low) I.Q. in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Patients who were classified as imbeciles were said to have no more intelligence than a seven year-old child."
  },
  "choleric": {
    "short": "Are you easy to tick off? Known to have a short fuse? Then, you could be described as choleric. Don't worry; it's not a disease related to cholera. Choleric just means you're testy and irritable.",
    "long": "Before the advent of modern medicine, most folks believed that health and disease were the result of the balance of \"humors\" in the body. If you were quick to anger, you were thought to have too much choler in your system. You were called choleric. W. C. Fields, Richard Nixon, and Ebenezer Scrooge are just a few people famous for being choleric, easy to tick off."
  },
  "epicurean": {
    "short": "Used as a noun or adjective, epicurean refers to a devotion to pleasure or refined, sensuous enjoyment, especially of good food and drink.",
    "long": "Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher this word was named after, taught his students that pleasure was a sign of the good, and pain a sign of evil. Thus the \"good life\" was one filled with pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Over the centuries, epicurean has come to refer to the pursuit of the finer things in life, and the word has a whole host of great synonyms, including luxurious, voluptuous, hedonistic, and, as a noun, bon vivant."

  "chronicle": {
    "short": "To chronicle an event is to record it as it happens, and a chronicle is a record of those events.  If your grandmother took the time to chronicle the details of her 1910 journey to Japan, you can read her chronicle today.",
    "long": "To chronicle something is to describe past or current events.  Chronicle is related to chronological and comes from the Greek ta khronika, which means “annals of time.”  Events are usually chronicled in the order in which they occurred. The noun chronicle is a record of things that happened — told in chronological order, like the diary you kept in elementary school. It is a chronicle of those years."

  "derogate": {
    "short": "When you derogate someone, you belittle them or put them down. If you tend to derogate everyone around you, it's unlikely you'll win the election for class president.",
    "long": "It's extremely common in politics to hear a candidate derogate their opponent, or for one political party to derogate another. When they do this, they are focusing on their adversary's weaknesses and faults in an attempt to harm their reputation. This sense of weakening someone's reputation dates from the 15th century, and it stems from the Latin derogare, \"take away,\" a root derogate shares with derogatory."
  },
  "palatable": {
    "short": "Something that is palatable is acceptable to one’s sense of taste—literally or figuratively. If it's palatable, then you can put up with it — whether it's leftovers or a mediocre made-for-TV movie.",
    "long": "The palate is the roof of the mouth, the combination of structures that separates the mouth from the nose. Early anatomists believed that the sense of taste was located in the palate, and, just as taste is metaphorically expanded to include sensibilities beyond the experience of food and drink, so palatable can be used to describe phenomena beyond the culinary. And, while palatable can mean pleasing or agreeable, it generally means merely tolerable—edible, rather than delicious."
  },
  "conversant": {
    "short": "If you know a lot about computer programming, then you could describe yourself as conversant with the latest updates in coding languages. This means you have current working knowledge of the topic.",
    "long": "The word conversant can be traced back to the Latin word conversari, meaning to “keep company with.” If you’re conversant with something, then you’re familiar with it — as if you have been keeping company with it. The word is often paired with the prepositions with, as in \"being conversant with the Detroit area, or in, as in \"if you speak French, you’re conversant in French.\""
  },
  "pedant": {
    "short": "A pedant is an annoying person who is focused on minor details and book knowledge rather than ordinary common sense. In war, it can be dangerous to have a pedant as commander — he'll insist on textbook maneuvers instead of adapting to circumstances on the ground.",
    "long": "This word was borrowed from French pédant or Italian pedante \"teacher, schoolmaster,\" but its ultimate origin is unknown. One theory is that the original meaning of Italian pedante was \"foot soldier,\" associated with the Italian word pedagogo \"teacher\" because teachers are always on their feet. Another theory is that Italian pedante was formed from the root of Greek paideuein \"to teach,\" which happens to be the source of English pedagogue \"teacher.\" In fact, a pedagogue is a pedantic teacher."
  },
  "whimsical": {
    "short": "Whimsical means full of or characterized by whims, which are odd ideas that usually occur to you very suddenly. If you decide at the last minute to fly to Europe, you could say you went there on a whim.",
    "long": "Whimsical can also mean tending toward odd or unpredictable behavior. Both whimsical and whim are derived from an earlier English word whim-wham, which is of unknown origin. Whim-wham had about the same meaning as whim, but could also refer to an odd object or piece of clothing."
  },
  "symmetry": {
    "short": "Things that have symmetry are balanced, with each side reflecting the other. A human body has such complex symmetry, from eyes, ears, and nostrils to arms, legs, and feet, that even a minor injury can make a body look unbalanced.",
    "long": "Snowflakes and butterflies often have a remarkable natural symmetry, with patterns on one side matched by those on the other. Objects that have identical or very similar parts lying at equal distances from a central point or line or plane — that is, objects that have symmetry — often work better. Symmetry helps boats stay upright in water. In design, symmetry is a balancing of objects, as when two candlesticks on a fireplace mantel are at equal distances from the center of the mantel. A lack of symmetry — i.e., asymmetry — might mean putting both candlesticks together at one end of the mantel."
  },
  "cadge": {
    "short": "To cadge is to plead or beg for something. A hungry child might cadge an extra cookie from her dad while he's baking.",
    "long": "When you cadge something, you wheedle or plead for it, manipulating someone into giving it to you. If you forget your lunch, you might have to cadge parts of your friend's meal, and if you don't have change for a parking meter, you might try to cadge some from a person walking by. Since the early 1800s, to cadge has meant \"to beg,\" and while its origin is uncertain, it may come from cadger, \"itinerant dealer\" or \"peddler.\""
  },
  "confuse": {
    "short": "If you confuse two things, you are not correctly identifying them. If you confuse heartburn with a heart attack, you might end up at the emergency room instead of in the antacid aisle of the drugstore.",
    "long": "To confuse can also mean to bewilder. If you tell a teacher that she's confusing you, you probably mean that she's being more complex than you can handle. A lot of people get confused by the differences among \"their,\" \"they're,\" and \"there.\" To confuse the situation even further, there's \"theirs\" and \"there's.\""

  "efficacious": {
    "short": "When you really want to do something right, really nail it, really get at what you were going for — you're trying to be efficacious, or produce the effect you intended.",
    "long": "The word efficacious is made up of the Latin efficere meaning \"accomplish\" and the suffix -ious meaning \"full of.\" Something that's efficacious is full of accomplishment. An efficacious medicine is one that cures you of the ailment you had. An efficacious recipe is one that comes out the way you intended it to taste. Remember that efficacious has two fs and two cs in it and you'll be efficacious in your spelling of the word."
  },
  "flimsy": {
    "short": "You can describe weak, thin, and fragile things as flimsy. Onion smells are strong, onion skins are flimsy. Blaming onions for making you cry during a sad movie, that's a flimsy excuse, when there are no onions in the theater.",
    "long": "A flimsy object and a flimsy objection or excuse are both without weight and are easy to knock down. You can see right through a flimsy curtain, and you can see right through a flimsy lie. If a tent or house of cards is flimsy, it will fall down with a slight breeze, and if your story isn't convincing anyone, it's probably weak and flimsy enough to flatten, too."
  },
  "casualty": {
    "short": "In wartime, you'll hear the word casualty used often for someone killed or injured. But casualty can also refer to deaths or injuries suffered in an accident or some other unfortunate event.",
    "long": "The term \"casualties of war\" has been around for a while and refers to the ugly downside of military victory. Anyone who loses life or limb, either in the fighting or as a civilian, is called a casualty. You can also use this word figuratively: if a local elementary school loses funding for their art classes and after-school activities, you can say that the students are casualties of budget cuts."
  },
  "concede": {
    "short": "If you concede something, you admit that it is true, proper, or certain — usually in an unwilling way and often in the context of a competition, as in \"At midnight, the candidate finally conceded defeat.\"",
    "long": "In its most common senses, a near synonym of concede is acknowledge — if your mom is pointing out that you need sleep before the test, you should concede the truth of what she's saying. But another meaning of concede is to give away or grant something, as when an unpopular leader is unwilling to concede power. Concede is from Latin concēdere, from the prefix com-, \"completely,\" plus cēdere, \"to go along, grant, yield.\" The corresponding noun is concession."

  "fluctuate": {
    "short": "Something that fluctuates varies or changes — it's the opposite of steady. Like the ups and downs of the stock market or the relationship status of a Hollywood starlet.",
    "long": "Fluctuate is a verb that describes movement, sometimes irregular, but often rising and falling in a wave-like pattern. The tides fluctuate according to the weather and season, for example. Your emotions fluctuate depending on what happens throughout the day, and so does your weight. In fact, you usually weigh less in the morning, before you've eaten. You're also taller, since your spine compresses as you walk around. So your height fluctuates, too."

    "long": "If your teacher comments on the obliquity of your poem, it may be a compliment, or it may mean your writing is just hard to understand. And while obliquity isn't a bad quality in a poet, it's less desirable in a math tutor, or anyone who needs to be straightforward and clear. We can trace the origin of obliquity back to the Latin obliquus, \"slanting, sidelong, or indirect.\""

  "transaction": {
    "short": "A transaction is any kind of action involved in conducting business, or an interaction between people. When you go to the bank, fill out a form, and deposit your paycheck, you make a transaction.",
    "long": "An important business deal can be called a transaction, particularly the buying or selling of goods, but you can call any exchange with another person a transaction. There are transactions involving money, ideas, and even e-mail. The Latin root transactionem describes an agreement or accomplishment. This led to a mid-15th century version of transaction that described the adjustment of a dispute."

  "refugee": {
    "short": "A refugee is someone who has left a dangerous place for a less dangerous place. You could help refugees from a hurricane by bringing them food and blankets.",
    "long": "Refuge means shelter. So a refugee is a person that seeks shelter, usually from war, natural disaster, or some other harmful situation. If you see the conditions inside a refugee camp, you will realize how hard the lives of the refugees must have been before leaving home."
  },
  "medium": {
    "short": "Think of the word medium as something in between. In clothing, we have small, medium, and large; in communications, it's what signals travel through from broadcast to receiver; and in spiritual terms, it’s a person who converses with the dead.",
    "long": "The word medium — from the Latin adjective medius, \"middle\" — has several meanings that all center on the idea of being in between. From the air that carries the broadcast signal, to the person who transmits messages from the dead, to the measurement of the \"doneness\" of your steak, medium means something that lies between two other points, people, or levels."

  "dogma": {
    "short": "Dogma means the doctrine of belief in a religion or a political system.",
    "long": "The literal meaning of dogma in ancient Greek was \"something that seems true.\" These days, in English, dogma is more absolute. If you believe in a certain religion or philosophy, you believe in its dogma, or core assumptions. If you belong to a cult that believes that cupcake consumption is the only true path, then you follow the cupcake dogma. Dogma, once adopted, is accepted without question. Go eat cupcakes!"

    "short": "A parody is a humorous or mocking imitation of something, using the same form as the original. To parody a poem, you have to write another poem.",
    "long": "A parody is a form of humor that spoofs — or satirizes — something using the same form. For example, shows like \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Daily Show\" parody newscasts by doing fake newscasts that look like the real thing. Comedians and comedy writers love to parody the President. Anything in the public eye could be the object of a parody."

    "long": "Although apathy is a lazy-sounding word indicating a lack of interest, action, or emotion, it has traveled through many languages to arrive in English. From the Greek apatheia, \"freedom from suffering\" or \"impassibility,\" apathy has existed in English since the 17th century. Not just one person, but a whole segment of the population can be accused of inaction or emotional detachment: the expressions voter apathy, student apathy, and consumer apathy show just how unenthusiastic groups of people can be."

  "replete": {
    "short": "Replete means full, often in a satisfying way. \"The library was replete with bound first editions, and Lucy, a bookworm, was happier there than any place else.\"",

When your cabinets are bare, you go to the store to replenish them. When you unpack your groceries, your pantry is replete with essentials."
  },
  "contention": {
    "short": "There is nothing \"content,\" or satisfying, about being in contention, and that's probably because the word contention means being in a competition that only one side can win.",
    "long": "\"And in this corner, the contender\" is heard at most boxing matches to describe each of the fighters about to go into contention in the ring. Sometimes, though, a contention can be a battle of words or a struggle between two parties over a single point. The expression \"bone of contention\" describes a narrow object of disagreement that reaches the level of strife, or contention. For two hungry dogs, though, the bone of contention might be a serious matter."

  "mute": {
    "short": "Mute means “silent.” No matter how much you talk to your houseplants, they’ll never talk back; they'll remain mute.",
    "long": "When used as a noun, mute can mean “someone who isn't capable of speech\" or “a device that deadens the sound of an instrument.” Mute can also be used as a verb meaning \"to make silent.” One might mute the television by pressing a button on the remote, or one might try to mute a loquacious individual.

Figuratively, it means an act of respect though sometimes with the negative connotation of slavishly doing as expected.

  "condescend": {
    "short": "A snooty waiter might condescend to serve you dinner at a fancy restaurant, meaning that he'd consider himself far too important to carry out the mundane task of delivering your hamburger and fries.",
    "long": "You might have noticed that condescend contains the word descend, meaning to move down from a higher place. You can think of condescend as lowering yourself to do a task that you feel is far beneath you. Kings and queens would never condescend to do their own laundry at the palace, for example. If they even knew how to do the laundry, you can be sure they'd do it in a condescending, or superior, way to let everyone know that housework is no task for a monarch."

  "sagacious": {
    "short": "Use the formal adjective sagacious to describe someone who is wise and insightful like an advisor to the president or a Supreme Court justice.",
    "long": "Someone like an inspirational leader or an expert in a field who seeks knowledge and has foresight can be described as sagacious. If you comment on something at a deeper level, you are making a sagacious observation. The word is a descendent of Latin sagus \"prophetic\" and is related to the Old English word seek. Synonyms include discerning, insightful and another formal word perspicacious."
  },
  "leery": {
    "short": "You can use the adjective leery to describe someone who's suspicious of a person or situation. After his brother came out with bald spots and uneven patches of buzz-cut hair, he was leery of having the same barber get near his own head.",
    "long": "Being leery is being distrustful. If you're leery, it will probably show on your face and in your posture. You may squint and wrinkle your brows or take a few steps back. If you're leery that someone won't keep a secret, you won't confide in them, and if you're leery about whether they'll keep a promise to you, you won't count on them. Sometimes people are leery because of some proof, but often, just having a bad feeling or instinct is enough to make a person leery."
  },
  "deduce": {
    "short": "To deduce is to figure something out based on what you already know. When you see a person crying, it's easy to deduce that the person is sad. Unless they're happy, of course. Sometimes happy people cry.",
    "long": "Derived from the Latin ducere, meaning \"to lead,\" a person who deduces something is \"leading\" their mind from one idea to the next. Deduction is a noun from the verb deduce: it's what we call something that we learn when we deduce. Sherlock Holmes, the famous investigator created by Arthur Conan Doyle, was a master of deduction. He could deduce from a few small clues all of the facts of a murder case."
  },
  "token": {
    "short": "When you give someone a flower or a friendship bracelet or something symbolic of the way you feel about them, you're giving them a token of your affection.",
    "long": "A token is not only something sentimental (like a keepsake) or symbolic (like your friendship bracelet). You, yourself, can also be a token: If you're the only female in your office, for instance, and you were hired just so there'd be at least one woman, then you're the \"token female.\" Tokens can also be a kind of special currency, like the coins you use in slot machines. Before the Metro Card, New York City subway riders paid their fares with tokens."

  },
  "resolve": {
    "short": "To resolve is to settle or make a decision about something — often formal. A college's board of directors  might resolve to recruit more minority students. As a noun, resolve refers to a strong determination to do something.",
    "long": "If you make a New Year's resolution to exercise every day, you'll need plenty of resolve to stick with your program. The verb descends from Middle English resolven \"to dissolve,\" from Latin resolvere \"to untie.\" In English, the obsolete sense of \"to dissolve\" can be seen in this line from Shakespeare: \"O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew.\""
  },
  "onus": {
    "short": "Take the noun, onus, as a formal word for responsibility or obligation. If your teacher assigns onus as a vocabulary word, it puts the onus on you to find out what it means.",
    "long": "Onus is a formal or sophisticated way to say \"responsibility\" or \"duty.\" It sounds a little like the unrelated word owner, so think about the person with onus as owner of the responsibility. If the onus is on you to organize a fund raiser, you have to set the whole thing up. Have you ever heard the legal term onus probandi? It means the burden of proof, which requires the accuser to prove the case against the accused."
  },
  "prosaic": {
    "short": "Prosaic means ordinary or dull. Most of us lead a prosaic everyday life, sometimes interrupted by some drama or crisis.",
    "long": "This adjective is from Latin prosa, \"prose,\" which is ordinary writing intended to communicate ideas and information. Prose is often contrasted with poetry, which usually has a more imaginative and original style."
  },
  "calumnious": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "numinous": {
    "short": "Something numinous has a strong religious quality, suggesting the presence of a divine power. When you enter a temple, church, or mosque, you might feel as though you've entered a numinous space.",
    "long": "Numinous comes from the Latin numin- meaning \"divine power.\"  This word also comes from numen, a word used to describe the spirit or divine power characteristic of a thing or place. However, you don't have to be in a strictly religious environment to experience something numinous; you might see the beauty of a painting or the melody of a song as numinous — if they communicate a spiritual vibe."
  },
  "shirk": {
    "short": "To shirk your responsibilities is to avoid dealing with them — like when you watch four consecutive hours of infomercials instead of facing your homework.",
    "long": "A verb is an action word, so it's ironic that the verb shirk suggests inaction in the avoidance of work. To shirk carries with it a negative connotation of laziness. When Eleanor Roosevelt was asked how she conquered her shyness to become a powerful public figure, she responded, \"I faced each problem as it came along. . . . I never tried to shirk. I tried never to evade an issue. When I found I had something to do — I just did it.\" Ah, Eleanor, why can't we all be a bit more like you?"
  },
  "forswear": {
    "short": "To forswear is to give up an idea, belief, or habit that you’ve had previously. New Year’s is a popular time to forswear anything from sweets to bad relationships.",
    "long": "When you forswear, you abandon something completely. In Romeo and Juliet, Romeo is at first smitten by the maiden Rosaline, but once he lays eyes on Juliet, Rosaline is history. He says of Juliet, “Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight, for I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.”"
  },
  "entreat": {
    "short": "To entreat is to ask for something that is really important, like when you entreat the jury to spare your life.",
    "long": "The verb entreat implies that the person doing the entreating is really serious about what has to happen. Maybe it's even a matter of life and death, like when parents entreat their children to never drive drunk. Synonyms for entreat are plead, beg, beseech, and implore — all of these are words not to be used lightly. They carry more weight than ask and request."
  },
  "expend": {
    "short": "The verb expend means to use. If you expend all your energy raking the leaves, you may be too tired to play hockey afterwards. Better pace yourself — you'll never get all of the leaves on the ground, after all.",
    "long": "The verb expend means to spend or pay out. You can expend money, but you can also expend things like good will and time. As a voter, you can vote for or against the city's plan to expend money on a new library building, but the city may be expending voter willingness to support the plan if the building goes over the budget. There is no point in building a library if they can't afford to buy books!"
  },
  "precipice": {
    "short": "Cartoon characters often end up on a precipice, the edge of a steep cliff, where their chubby toes curl and cling as they totter and eventually fall, making a hole in the ground below and getting up again. Most real people avoid precipices.",
    "long": "Unless you're a skilled climber or mountain-sport enthusiast, a precipice is a scary thing. Some imagine falling off and making the sharp drop, while others get dizzy just thinking about looking down. This makes sense, considering that the 17th-century English word precipice comes, through French, from Latin words meaning \"headlong\" and \"abrupt descent.\" In modern use, precipice also describes how it feels to fall, or fail, in areas of life that don't involve mountains, such as being \"on the precipice of losing everything.\""
  },
  "exiguous": {
    "short": "If I had more than an exiguous amount of space here, I'd be able to tell you more about the fact that exiguous means a tiny amount.",
    "long": "Exiguous is one of those words that comes in handy when you're really trying to draw attention to the fact that there's very little of something. Otherwise you could just say \"tiny,\" \"small,\" \"niggling,\" or even \"scanty.\" Without more than the exiguous scraps of information currently available, there's simply no way to know who left the offending pile in the hallway, let alone when. If you expect more than just exiguous payment in return, you're going to have to do more than an exiguous amount of work."
  },
  "phlegmatic": {
    "short": "Yes, phlegmatic has roots in that colorless, mucousy stuff called phlegm, but people who are phlegmatic aren't called that because they have lots of mucus. They are just a little dull in expressing feelings or showing emotion.",
    "long": "It may be their training more than their natural behavior, but those palace guards who wear the red coats and big hats and show absolutely no expression on their faces are phlegmatic. Attempts to make them laugh, smile, or twist their faces in irritation won’t work, because being phlegmatic is important to their role as stone-faced keepers of the palace. Phlegmatic people show less emotion on the outside — but who knows, they may be jumping up and down on the inside."
  },
  "celibacy": {
    "short": "When you abstain from sex, you're practicing celibacy.",
    "long": "Roman Catholic priests and nuns take a vow of celibacy, and the practice is not uncommon in other religions, too. The idea is often that sexual relations, marriage, and children are a distraction that keep you from fully devoting yourself to the spiritual life. You can also use celibacy more generally to refer to the state of being single or unmarried."
  },
  "defiant": {
    "short": "Have you ever seen a picture of a protester who is about to be carried off by police but is still shouting or resisting, fighting to the bitter end? That person is defiant.",
    "long": "Someone who is defiant is bold, even in the face of defeat. A defiant person is usually fighting a powerful enemy. People who protest in countries controlled by dictators are defiant. Rosa Parks was defiant when she refused to give up her seat on the bus, even though the law at that time dictated that black people had to stand when whites needed a seat. Small children are defiant too, sometimes over nothing more than a request to share their toys."
  },
  "ornithologist": {
    "short": "An ornithologist is a type of zoologist who focuses on birds. If you want to know anything about our fine feathered friends, consult an ornithologist.",
    "long": "Having a birdbath in your backyard doesn't make you an ornithologist. An ornithologist is someone who studies ornithology — the branch of science devoted to birds. Ornithologists study every aspect of birds, including bird songs, flight patterns, physical appearance, and migration patterns. Birds are genetically related to dinosaurs, which is something else an ornithologist might study."
  },
  "venal": {
    "short": "Someone with venal motives is corrupt and maybe a little evil. Nobody wants to be thought of as venal.",
    "long": "Venal actions include taking bribes, giving jobs to your friends, and cheating. Venal means about the same thing as \"corrupt\" or \"corruptible.\" Venal people are considered sleazy and untrustworthy. They're often criminals. No one is perfect, and most of us have venal motives at some point."
  },
  "obdurate": {
    "short": "Obdurate is a formal word meaning stubborn. If you want to major in English, but your parents are obdurate that you should go premed, they might go so far as to threaten not to pay your tuition.",
    "long": "This adjective descends from Latin obdurare, \"to harden.\" A near synonym is adamant, from Latin adamas, \"hard metal, diamond.\" So both of these synonyms derive from the quality of hardness being associated with a stubborn personality."
  },
  "propitious": {
    "short": "When the timing of something is propitious, it's likely to turn out well. A propitious time for taking a big test is when you've studied hard and had a good night's sleep.",
    "long": "If you believe in astrology, you might check your horoscope to settle on a propitious day for your wedding. A propitious moment to ask your parents about that spring break trip to Cancun might be when you've just unveiled your straight-A report card."
  },
  "temerity": {
    "short": "Use the noun temerity to mean the quality of being unafraid of danger or punishment. If you have the temerity to jump off the bridge even after hearing about the risk of instant death, you truly are a nutcase.",
    "long": "Someone who has the temerity to do something is usually considered to be bold in a foolish way. Near synonyms are audacity and recklessness. Temerity is from Middle English temeryte, from Latin temeritas, from temere \"by chance, rashly.\""
  },
  "apparel": {
    "short": "Apparel is just another word for what you wear. Hopefully the apparel you wear to work — suits and heels — is very different from the apparel you wear on the weekends — pajama pants and bunny slippers.",
    "long": "The noun apparel got its start from the Latin apparare, meaning to “prepare, make ready,” or ad-particulare, meaning “to put things together.” In the mid 13th century it evolved into a verb meaning “to equip.” It wasn’t until the next century that people began to use apparel as both a verb meaning “to attire” and as a noun meaning garments or clothing. Said 17th century British writer Thomas Fuller, “…Apparel shapes: but it's money that finishes the man.”"
  },
  "fraternal": {
    "short": "Use the adjective fraternal to mean \"brotherly,\" the way you'd describe your fraternal relationship with your oldest friend who is like a brother to you.",
    "long": "A fight between brothers? You could chalk it up to fraternal rivalry. Fraternal describes the relationship between brothers, but it is also used is to describe a club, society or fraternity, some brotherly group of people — usually men — with common interests. Fraternal twins, unlike identical twins, are formed from separate ova. That's why they don't look exactly alike and can be a girl and a boy, instead of two girls or two boys."
  },
  "finesse": {
    "short": "Having finesse means you can handle difficult situations with diplomacy and tact, like the finesse it takes to help two friends work out their differences — without taking sides or alienating either one.",
    "long": "Finesse is having grace under pressure. It's handling the rantings of an angry customer with a smile and a calm tone. Someone who has finesse says the right thing at the right time — or knows when to say nothing at all. Finesse looks like fineness and in fact comes from the Middle French word that means exactly that — delicate in nature. People with finesse can handle anything — with a delicate approach that really works."
  },
  "innocence": {
    "short": "Innocence means you’ve done nothing wrong.  You’ve broken no laws, committed no sins, and are not guilty of any morally evil act.  Well done.",
    "long": "In a courtroom, a defendant might announce their innocence, claiming they did not commit whatever crime they’re accused of.  Innocence is very important in many religions, where your moral purity decides what happens to your soul after you die.  The word comes from the Latin innocentia, which means “not harming” and someone with innocence will not harm themselves or others, at least not on purpose.  Remember that there are no ss in innocence, so spell it with two cs."
  },
  "static": {
    "short": "Static means not moving or changing––it's often used to describe abstract ideas that can't be seen. \"The troops were moving all over the country, engaged in skirmishes, but the army's overall position remained static.\"",
    "long": "Static is easier to remember if you think of the sta- in \"standing still\" and stationary. Remember what happens when you rub a balloon against your head? That's producing a stationary electric charge, otherwise known as static electricity."
  },
  "dolorous": {
    "short": "Dolorous is not a woman's name (that's Dolores), it is an adjective that describes someone showing great sadness. If your friend Dolores is crying about a lost puppy, you could call her dolorous Dolores.",
    "long": "Music written in a minor key can have a dolorous effect. It sounds really sad, and can make you feel the same way. Dolorous shares the same root with the word, condolence, an expression of sympathy with someone's sadness. Both of these words come from the Latin word for grief, dolor, which in current Spanish happens to mean pain."
  },
  "inchoate": {
    "short": "Inchoate means just beginning to form. You can have an inchoate idea, like the earliest flickers of images for your masterpiece, or an inchoate feeling, like your inchoate sense of annoyance toward your sister's new talking parrot.",
    "long": "Inchoate comes from a Latin word for beginning. When something is inchoate, although you don’t yet understand what it is fully, you have a strong sense that it is indeed coming. It’s stronger than the wisp of an idea that never turns into anything. But it’s hard to really find the language to describe an inchoate idea. That’s the whole point: you don’t have the words for it yet!"

  "hodgepodge": {
    "short": "A hodgepodge is a random assortment of things. A dorm room might be furnished with a hodgepodge of milk crates, antique mirrors, and a poster of a kitten hanging on a branch with one paw.",
    "long": "Hodgepodge is a funny-sounding word for a somewhat funny occurrence — a grouping of things or people that don't fit together. If you made a stew with bacon, oatmeal, and chocolate cake, you’ve made a hodgepodge (and a bellyache waiting to happen). The piles of stuff stacked in attics tend to be a hodgepodge. British people call it a hotchpotch. A hodgepodge can also be called a mishmash."

  "auction": {
    "short": "In an auction, items are sold without price tags — whoever bids the highest gets to buy it, whether it’s a painting, a car, or a set of old dishes.",
    "long": "You can hold an auction, or auction something. You might have seen auction scenes in classy old movies where the characters bid on paintings by politely raising their hands as the auctioneer calls out a price. Auctions aren’t always high-fallutin’, though — many cities auction off cars they’ve confiscated from criminals."
  },
  "epicure": {
    "short": "We call a person who truly loves food — food at the highest levels — an epicure. Occasionally, you might find the word epicure used for a person who loves something else, but an epicure is usually someone who delights in fine food.",
    "long": "Epicurus was the Greek philosopher whom we credit with thinking the most about cooking and food. So any time you see the word epicure, remember that that person follows the philosopher Epicurus and therefore loves food.  Being an epicure ain't cheap. Most fine restaurants these days will charge you an arm and a leg for a meal good enough to satisfy a real epicure."
  },
  "disparage": {
    "short": "If you haven't got anything nice to say, then it's time to disparage someone. It means to belittle or degrade a person or idea.",
    "long": "Disparage is a specific way to describe a certain kind of insult, the kind that secures the insulter's place as superior. It often refers to an opinion or criticism lobbed in print or via word of mouth, not necessarily an act done to someone's face. If someone or something is being disparaged, you will often find a competing interest in the wings."

  "dazzle": {
    "short": "To dazzle is to blind someone for a moment with light, like a deer in the headlights. You can also dazzle by impressing people, and not just by wearing a sparkly sequined shirt.",
    "long": "Have you ever had a light shine in your face so you couldn't see for a second? You were dazzled. To dazzle is to blind someone in this way. A car's high-beam lights can dazzle other drivers. Looking directly at the sun is a way to dazzle yourself. Dazzling puts you in a daze for a second. Also, anything impressive can dazzle. A great writer dazzles readers. An impressive speaker dazzles listeners. It's like you're blinded by their brilliance."
  },
  "gregarious": {
    "short": "If you know someone who's outgoing, sociable, and fond of the company of others, you might want to call her gregarious.",
    "long": "The word was originally used to describe animals that live in flocks — it's from the Latin word grex, meaning \"herd.\" Not surprisingly, people began using it to describe humans who liked being in groups. Today biologists still speak of gregarious species, but you're more likely to hear it in reference to people. Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name Gregory — but if you know an outgoing fellow with that name, you could call him Greg-arious."

  "cordial": {
    "short": "Use cordial to describe a relationship that is friendly and sincere but not overly close. A cordial greeting is perfectly pleasant but doesn't involve lots of hugging or excessive emotion.",
    "long": "You might have cordial relationships with most of the kids in your close, but only confide in your closest friends. In Middle English, this adjective meant \"of the heart,\" borrowed from medieval Latin cordiālis, from Latin cor, \"heart.\" This core sense of \"heart\" can be seen in the synonyms heartfelt and hearty. The noun cordial originally referred to a medicine or drink that stimulates the heart, but its current sense is \"a liqueur.\""
  },
  "flounder": {
    "short": "A flounder is a flat fish with both eyes on one side of its head; and, as a verb, to flounder is to wobble around like a fish out of water.",
    "long": "To flounder is to be unsteady or uncertain. It's probably from the Dutch word flodderen, \"to flop about,\" or it's a mix of founder (\"to fail\") and blunder (\"do something clumsy\"). If you flounder in the ocean, you need a surfer dude to scoop you up. You don't have to be in water, though; you can flounder any time you're a little wobbly — like after a long hike or during the last hour of the SATs. Either way, when you flounder, you wish you were a flat fish at the bottom of the sea."
  },
  "error": {
    "short": "\"I'm sorry, sir, there's been some sort of error in the kitchen,\" is what a restaurant waiter might say to a patron who ordered the fish but was mistakenly served a plateful of worms instead.",
    "long": "Simply put, an error is a mistake. However, that mistake is more likely due to a lapse in judgment or skill than to an accident. A plane crash that occurs after the pilot mistakenly presses the \"pilot eject\" button is said to be caused by \"human error.\" A baseball play in which the pitcher throws the ball to second base instead of first because he was distracted by a pretty girl in the stands is an error — one that might cost his team the game."
  },
  "semantic": {
    "short": "If something is semantic, it has to do with the meaning of a word. If you're spending all this time reading the dictionary, you must be interested in semantic questions — or you just want better grades on your vocabulary quizzes.",
    "long": "Semantic comes from the Greek word for \"significant,\" and has to do with how, say, the word dog actually means that furry friend of yours, and all the others like him. If you're really into the philosophy of language and how words come to have particular meanings, then you like semantics. It can be an adjective, as in a semantic argument with your mom over the meaning of \"grounded,\" or a noun, meaning \"the study of signs and meaning.\""
  },
  "shrill": {
    "short": "A shrill sound is high pitched and sharp, like the squeak of the mouse in your cupboard or the sound of your “eek” when you hear it.",
    "long": "Closer to a shriek than a trill, a shrill tone is one that might make you cover your ears, usually because the tone is so high and sharp. A high pitched voice, a classroom of excited first graders, or the sound of chalk scraping the board can all be shrill, as can a color or light that looks as sharp and intense as a shrill tone sounds."
  },
  "demography": {
    "short": "Do you know the population growth rate of your city? The education levels of everyone on your block? Then you're a fan of demography, the branch of sociology that studies human behavior by analyzing statistical information.",
    "long": "The word demography comes from two ancient Greek words, demos, meaning \"the people,\" and graphy, meaning \"writing about or recording something\" — so literally demography means \"writing about the people.\" Like many branches of the sciences, demography began in the 19th century, when the general craze for cataloging information about the world really took off (think Darwin.) A common related word is demographics, referring to the raw statistical data that's used for analysis."
  },
  "factious": {
    "short": "A factious group is one that breaks away, or wants to. It’s often used in politics, where people separate into smaller like-minded groups. The Confederacy was factious — they wanted out of the Union, but we know how that turned out.",
    "long": "The word factious looks a lot like its cousin faction, which is a small, sometimes rebellious group. Factious, then, is easy to remember, as the adjectival form of the noun faction. To be factious is to act like a faction. Among bakers, almost all agree that you have to be precise when measuring ingredients. The Brooklyn Faction, though, disagrees. This factious bunch never uses measuring cups or spoons and has called for them to be abolished."
  },
  "inure": {
    "short": "To inure is to get used to something difficult or unpleasant. If after spending an hour in your brother's room, you stop noticing the stinky-sock smell, you have become inured to the odor.",
    "long": "Although the Latin roots of inure mean \"in work,\" it may be easier to think of  \"in use\" when you see inure. Got new shoes that give you blisters? When they are \"in use\" long enough, your feet will become inured to the spots that rub, and while you may have calluses, you will not be in pain. You can be inured to more abstract things too. When weathermen constantly play up the next big snowstorm or blizzard, you become inured to it and stop paying attention to them."
  },
  "splendid": {
    "short": "Looking truly magnificent today? Then someone (probably British) might stop you to say \"Wow! You look splendid, darling!\" Thanks the person, because splendid means glorious, fabulous, wonderful, and/or splendiferous.",
    "long": "Use the adjective splendid to describe something of the highest quality. If you're so lucky as to have someone buy you, say, a Harry Winston diamond, splendid! But splendid doesn't apply only to expensive items such as jewelry, clothing, or art. You can also have a splendid idea, morning walk, or encounter with an old friend. For some, using Splenda in their coffee instead of sugar is, for them, well, splendid!"

  "craven": {
    "short": "A craven man is no Superman or Spiderman, nor is he a firefighter or a soldier. A craven man is the opposite of those guys: he has not an ounce of courage.",
    "long": "In \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Cowardly Lion could have been called the Cravenly Lion, but that didn't sound quite right. Use craven as you would cowardly. A craven leader is scared to lead, while a craven gymnast stays on the mat and avoids the balance beam. You can also use the word to describe other things, besides humans. Craven policies, for example, are probably weak and do not take bold measures."
  },
  "prodigality": {
    "short": "Prodigality is excessive or extravagant spending. Your friend may feel he needs those gold chairs for his living room, but to everyone else it’s another example of his prodigality.",
    "long": "“Idleness is the greatest prodigality,” said Ben Franklin. He was probably right, but today prodigality is more often used to talk about spending monetary resources, as opposed to other kinds of resources. Prodigality does not merely refer to spending above your means. It’s excessive or wasteful spending, often with an eye toward the luxurious. Think of the Palace of Versailles, or that film star who owns ten expensive cars but doesn’t drive. Synonyms for prodigality include extravagance, profligacy, and lavishness."

  "hydrate": {
    "short": "To hydrate is to add or absorb water. It's hot outside — don't forget to hydrate by drinking plenty of water!",
    "long": "If you want to sound fancy, you can use the word hydrate every time you get a drink of water. Along with most organisms, we need to hydrate, or ingest water, to stay alive. This verb is also commonly used to mean \"moisturize,\" as in \"this magic cream will hydrate your skin like you won't believe!\" As a noun, hydrate refers to a chemical compound that includes water molecules. A French chemist coined the noun in 1800 from the Greek hydor, \"water.\""
  },
  "describe": {
    "short": "To describe is to report details about something either out loud or in writing. \"Since we can't come to Paris with you, please describe it in your letter!\"",
    "long": "Describe is from the Latin word describere which means  \"to write down.\" When you describe something, you're \"da\" scribe, the person writing things down! Writing teachers love to have students describe, using lots of details using the five senses and figurative language. It doesn't have to be written down, though — you can also describe that gold dress you saw to your friend on the phone. Or you can describe a circle, by sketching it out with a stick in the sand."
  },
  "intangible": {
    "short": "You can't touch this word — it is intangible. You can grasp the meaning of the word in your head, but you can't close your hands around it; you'll just put fingerprints on your monitor.",
    "long": "The Latin verb tangere means \"to touch,\" and the 16th-century English word tangible comes from it. Something intangible can't be touched physically, but most of the time it is understandable or even felt in the heart. Sadness can't be picked up and thrown in the garbage can because it is intangible, but you can throw away the tissues wet with tears. Laughing is intangible too, but you can hold onto movies, pets, and friends that make you laugh."

    "short": "Mercurial describes someone whose mood or behavior is changeable and unpredictable, or someone who is clever, lively, and quick. With a mercurial teacher, you never know where you stand.",
    "long": "Mercury was the ancient Roman god of commerce and messenger of the gods, and the planet Mercury was named after the Roman god. In Middle English, this adjective meant \"relating to the planet or god Mercury\" and derives from Latin mercuriālis, from Mercurius \"Mercury.\"  A mercurial personality has the unpredictability associated with the god Mercury or, in astrology, is supposedly influenced by the planet."

  "decapitate": {
    "short": "When the bad-tempered Queen of Hearts cried “off with their heads!” in Alice in Wonderland, she was ordering her henchmen to decapitate those who had offended her.",
    "long": "The verb decapitate comes from Latin de ”away” or “down” and caput “head.” Don’t confuse it with kaput, a German word that means “broken” or destroyed.” Of course, if someone were to decapitate you, you’d be pretty well kaput."
  },
  "enervate": {
    "short": "To enervate is to weaken, wear down, or even bum out. Although a three-hour lecture on the history of socks might thrill someone, it would enervate most people. So would a too-long soak in a hot tub. With your parents.",
    "long": "Trace enervate back far enough and you'll discover that it comes from the Latin enervare which means basically “to cut the sinew” or “to cause to be cut from the muscle.” That would certainly weaken someone. These days, there’s no need for violence. To enervate someone is to sap their energy, like by reading your ex all the love letters your new sweetheart wrote you. When something enervates you, it does more than get on your nerves; it brings you down."
  },
  "maintain": {
    "short": "Maintain means to keep the same––keep steady, keep up, or keep going. Sure, you can ride your bike super fast on a flat surface, but it can be hard to maintain that speed, or keep the same speed, going up a hill.",
    "long": "When you maintain a strict study schedule, you stick to it. When you maintain your car in good working order, you take good care of it. If you maintain records of your business activity, it means you make notes of your sales and expenses. If a teacher maintains order in the classroom, she never lets disruptions get out of hand. If you maintain your family, you keep them in food, shelter and clothing. If you maintain that eating animals is cruel, you keep that position."

  "terminate": {
    "short": "To terminate something is to bring it to an end. Period. Full stop.",
    "long": "In ancient Rome, Terminus was the God of landmarks, boundaries, and endings. That’s why his annual party took place at the end of the year.  You can imagine the guests walking around in their togas, going, “This party is so great, I wish it would never terminate.” Nowadays, terminate can be used to refer to bringing anything to an end — including one's job or a product line: \"When the Weird Food Company announces plans to terminate production of its deep-fried chocolate-covered pickle line, it will be a sad day for lovers of strange snacks.\""
  },
  "diurnal": {
    "short": "If it’s 9:00 at night and your mom wants you to do the dishes, you could try to put it off until the next day by politely pointing out that you are a diurnal animal. That means you get most of your activities done during the day.",
    "long": "The adjective diurnal can be used to describe anything that takes place in the daytime, but it is most often used in the field of biology to describe animals that are active during the day and then sleep at night. Animals with the opposite schedule are said to be nocturnal, which means they’re active at night and sleep in the daytime. Diurnal can also be used to describe something that has a daily cycle, such as a diurnal tide that occurs once each day."
  },
  "piety": {
    "short": "Piety is devotion to God or to religious practices. Nuns who pray all day long are famous for their piety. If you have filial piety it means you're devoted to your parents.",
    "long": "Piety is sometimes used in a disapproving way to mean that the person is only pretending to be devoted or good.  It was borrowed from the French word pieté, meaning \"piety or pity,\" ultimately from the Latin pius, \"devoted, kind.\" This Latin adjective is also the source of our English adjective pious."
  },
  "slur": {
    "short": "A slur is an insulting remark. In a political campaign, it’s not unheard of for a candidate to launch a slur at her opponent, though doing so is usually frowned upon.",
    "long": "Slur can also be used as a verb meaning “to insult,” and it has a number of additional meanings as well. To slur one’s speech is to pronounce words in a clumsy, lazy way. In the context of music, to slur is to slide smoothly from one note to another. The word history of slur is hazy, but some scholars have suggested a relationship with a Dutch word meaning \"to drag.\""
  },
  "scrutinize": {
    "short": "If you want to examine something closely and go over every single detail, then you should scrutinize it. Like the way your mom probably assesses your outfit before you leave the house for school.",
    "long": "Scrutinizing is very different from glancing or gazing. It's even more than a long, hard look. To scrutinize something, you have to look at it really critically, investigating every nook and cranny. Often things are scrutinized to verify if they're correct or authentic. So it makes perfect sense that this verb is rooted in the Latin word scrutari, which means “to search.”"
  },
  "synthesize": {
    "short": "When you synthesize, you combine two or more things to create something more complex. It's becoming more common for doctors these days to synthesize Eastern and Western approaches to medicine.",
    "long": "While synthesize was first used in 1830, scientists and inventors were doing what it means long before that, mixing stuff together to create new materials and products. Medical researchers chemically synthesize chemicals every day in the lab, hoping to create the next wonder drug. When you write a research paper on a given topic, you must find and synthesize information related to that topic, so you can understand what it means and structure an argument in support of your thesis."
  },
  "posit": {
    "short": "To posit something is to assume or suggest that it is true. You can posit an idea or opinion.",
    "long": "When you posit, you submit an idea or give an opinion. Scientists posit many ideas — called hypotheses — that they then try to prove or disprove through experimentation and research. In science, you hear about positing a lot, and the same is true in math and logic. When you say \"If X, then Y\" you're positing a proposition. Positing can also mean to put something somewhere firmly — this means to deposit, fix, or situate."
  },
  "epitaph": {
    "short": "An epitaph is an inscription on a gravestone. Famous for his comedic jabs at the City of Brotherly Love, writer W.C. Fields once said he wanted \"I'd rather be living in Philadelphia\" as the epitaph on his tombstone.",
    "long": "Once you trace this word back to its origins, you'll never forget its meaning. Forms of it show up in Middle English, Old French, Latin, and, before that, Greek: epi- \"upon\" and taphos \"tomb.\" This gives us a mini history lesson on burial traditions. For thousands of years various societies have carved poetic, weepy, and witty words onto the monuments marking the final resting places of famous and infamous citizens."
  },
  "luminary": {
    "short": "In scientific writing, Stephen J. Hawking is a luminary. People look up to this well-known scientist and author for his knowledge and insight.",
    "long": "Although luminary can mean an object or celestial body that gives off light, you'll often hear people talk about parties at which there were many luminaries in attendance. In this case, luminary means celebrity or well-known person in sports or politics, science or the arts. Think of them as being bright lights that make a party sparkle."
  },
  "compromise": {
    "short": "A compromise is a way of settling differences by everybody making concessions. If you want to stay out until 10 and your friend wants to stay out until midnight, 11 is a good compromise.",
    "long": "Compromise comes from the Latin compromissum, which means \"mutual promise.\"  It can be a noun or a verb. If you compromise with your lab partner over how to analyze the experimental data, you find the middle ground between your two ideas. Compromise can also mean to erode or diminish. If you never repair your brakes, you will compromise the safety of the car.  If you cheat, you compromise your integrity."
  },
  "moiety": {
    "short": "A moiety is one of two equal parts. If you cut a sandwich in half, you can have one moiety for lunch and give the other moiety to a pigeon.",
    "long": "One moiety plus one moiety equals a whole. Moiety is a synonym for the noun half; a semicircle or your better half can be referred to as a moiety. In anthropology, moiety is used to describe one of two distinct groups of a tribe. Moiety can also mean \"a part\" in general, as Shakespeare used it in Antony and Cleopatra: \"The death of Antony / Is not a single doom; in the name lay / A moiety of the world.\""
  },
  "moribund": {
    "short": "Something that is moribund is almost dead, like a moribund economy that has been stuck in a recession for years.",
    "long": "In Latin, mori means \"to die.\" You probably recognize this root in words like mortal, mortician, and mortuary. Moribund means \"near death,\" but it can also mean something that is coming to an end, nearly obsolete, or stagnant. For example, as streaming videos over the Internet becomes a more and more popular way to watch movies and television shows, the DVD has become a moribund medium."
  },
  "propitiate": {
    "short": "If you forgot flowers on your grandma's birthday, you can still propitiate her by sending a bouquet the next day. Propitiate means to appease someone or make them happy by doing a particular thing. Handy strategy for lovers, too.",
    "long": "One of the most common uses of propitiate historically was in the sense of appeasing the gods, often  with a gift in the form of an animal or human sacrifice. Fortunately, for most people today flowers and candy will do the trick. But then again, some Moms can be tough to appease."
  },
  "filibuster": {
    "short": "As a verb, filibuster means \"to obstruct legislation by talking at great length.\" As a noun, it can refer to that oppositional speech. \"The Senator prevented a vote on the bill by reading the dictionary from aardvark to zyzzyva.\"",
    "long": "As a parliamentary tactic, the filibuster dates back to at least the first century B.C.E. The rules of the Roman Senate required that all business must be completed by nightfall, and, on more than one occasion, the senator Cato the Younger spoke until dark to delay a vote. In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a minister may \"talk out\" a bill, but his speech must pertain to the bill. In the United States, by contrast, a Senator may forestall action on a bill by speaking on any topic."
  },
  "refurbish": {
    "short": "Whether it’s a bike, an old computer, or a tennis stadium, when you refurbish something you clean it up and make it look or perform better.",
    "long": "When you refurbish something, you generally keep the structure the same but improve its looks and possibly its functionality. For example, if you renovate a room you may make it \"new again\" with structural changes, such as tearing down walls and altering its original design. If you refurbish it, however, you will most likely focus on making it look better with cosmetic changes, such as painting it. The word refurbish is also often used to describe secondhand technology that has been rebuilt to restore function by replacing a component that has failed."
  },
  "locus": {
    "short": "The center or source of something is known as the locus. A shopping mall is usually a locus for teenagers.",
    "long": "In addition to being a hub or hotspot, locus has specific meanings when used in math or science. In math, a locus is when a set of points all meet at a designated location: a circle is the locus of points equal in length from one given point. In genetics, the locus is the location of a certain gene on a chromosome. A locus is where things are happening. Washington, DC is the locus for politics in the U.S."
  },
  "clarion": {
    "short": "If you hear the clarion call of the stage, it means you want to be an actor. Clarion means loud and clear, and a clarion call is a call to something that is hard to ignore.",
    "long": "A clarion is a medieval horn with a clear sound. Hard to ignore, but also pure and clear in tone. There's nothing shrill about a \"clarion call.\" Martin Luther King Jr.'s clarion call for all races in the U.S. to live together in peace and harmony has lived on after his death."
  },
  "sage": {
    "short": "Use the word sage for someone or something wise and judicious. Thanks to the sage advice of your friend, you didn't write your teacher an angry e-mail!",
    "long": "Although you might think of a wizard when you hear the word sage, really it means a wise man. Today you see it used to refer to someone who has insight in a particular field. If someone is a policy sage, he knows just what advice to give politicians to make them understand the issue and respond successfully to it. In a totally unrelated use, there is also a plant called sage that is useful in home remedies and cooking."
  },
  "feckless": {
    "short": "If a newspaper editorial describes a politician as feckless, you might wonder, \"What is feck, and why doesn’t he have any?” In fact, the columnist is accusing the politician of being irresponsible and incompetent.",
    "long": "Did you know that most varieties of English are in fact “feck”-less? They don’t contain a word feck, only the negative counterpart feckless. The “feck” in feckless began as a short form of effect used in the Scots dialect. So feckless essentially means \"ineffective,\" but is also used to describe someone who is irresponsible, incompetent, inept, or without purpose in life."
  },
  "exert": {
    "short": "Exert basically means to put forth effort to do something. For example, when you exert yourself in a workout, you can really feel the burn in your muscles.",
    "long": "The Latin verb exserere — with its derivative form exsertus, which is the source of our word — means to \"put forth.\" That's where exert gets its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard at something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But exert can refer to other ways you \"push\": you exert your influence to convince others to think your way; when one nation exerts its power on another; and gravity exerts its force on us, holding us down on earth."
  },
  "agitate": {
    "short": "Agitate means to stir up. If you watch a horror movie at bedtime, you may be too agitated to sleep. Movies like that can agitate all sorts of adrenaline responses in the body.",
    "long": "Agitate derives from a Latin word that means \"to drive away.\" The meaning has changed, but you can see where old meets new—a washing machine agitates dirty clothes in warm soapy water to drive away the dirt. You agitate or shake up salad dressing to mix it, driving the oil away into the vinegar."
  },
  "grandstand": {
    "short": "As a noun, grandstand means a large seating area for sports spectators. As a verb, it means to show off. So if you dance around in a banana costume at the horse races, you grandstand in the grandstand.",
    "long": "Tiered, covered seating at a racetrack or outdoor sports arena is one kind of grandstand. This word has been used since the mid-18th century, and in the late 1800s it was adapted into the baseball slang phrases grandstand player and grandstand play, which referred to theatrical, unnecessary moves athletes made simply to show off. These terms found their way into college slang around the same time, and grandstand became a common way to say \"put on airs.\""
  },
  "eminence": {
    "short": "Eminence is superior status. If you become a world famous actor, the folks in your home town might treat you as an eminence when you come home for Thanksgiving. Just don't expect your family to do the same.",
    "long": "Eminence traces back to the Latin adjective ēminēntia, meaning high or lofty. We don't usually use it for mountain tops, however; it's social loftiness that scores eminence. Some special people are addressed as \"your eminence,\" in the same way you'd call a judge \"your honor.\" You can attain eminence or be an eminence. If you become a physical therapist, you might work with another kind of eminence: the high bit protruding from a bone where tendons or ligaments attach."
  },
  "stint": {
    "short": "The noun stint means a set amount of time in which you do something — often work of some sort. \"She served a stint in the army, followed by a stint in an office setting, before settling on a career as a lounge singer.\"",
    "long": "Unlike a project or vocation, a stint can refer to the stretch of time spent doing a particular job. You apply for a job, but you refer to your past stint in the Peace Corps. As a verb, stint means to be sparing or frugal, or restrict in a stingy manner (\"to skimp\"). \"The school board chose to make cuts at the administrative level, rather than stint on the children's education.\""
  },
  "extemporaneous": {
    "short": "Extemporaneous means spoken without preparation. The orator's performance was impressive, but only after we learn that his speech was extemporaneous did we realize the true depth of his talent.",
    "long": "Some politicians are so skilled that even their prepared remarks have an extemporaneous quality. As opposed to policy debates where teams know the resolution in advance, extemporaneous  debate is judged on style and nimble argumentation, as the participants receive the resolution minutes before debating begins."
  },
  "scathing": {
    "short": "Scathing means witheringly harsh. If you enter a singing contest and the judge says that your singing is like that of a toad with laryngitis, that is scathing criticism.",
    "long": "Scathing comes from an old Norse verb, to scathe, which means to injure by fire or lightning. Now we use it when someone’s critique is so harsh that it feels like you've been burned. If your best friend turns against you and advertises your faults to the world, and you feel like everyone is staring and talking about you, you are having a scathing experience."
  },
  "catcall": {
    "short": "Boooo! Hisss! Come on ref! Are you blind?! Those are just a few family-friendly catcalls, or rowdy cries of disapproval.",
    "long": "Next time you're stuck watching a terrible movie, don't throw rotten tomatoes at the screen. Try a catcall instead. The impassioned taunts and disapproving shouts are already a staple at sporting events across the globe. They're also a favorite among construction workers, who like to whistle at and catcall the ladies walking by. Which, by the way, is totally inappropriate."
  },
  "arbitrary": {
    "short": "Something that's arbitrary seems like it's chosen at random instead of following a consistent rule. Team members would dislike their coach using a totally arbitrary method to pick starting players.",
    "long": "Even though arbitrary comes from a word meaning \"judge\" (arbiter), that doesn't mean judges are always fair. Calling a decision-maker arbitrary is usually a negative thing, suggesting the person is making rules based on whim rather than justice. A coach who selects starting players arbitrarily isn't strictly applying a rule; he could just be picking names out of a hat."
  },
  "annotate": {
    "short": "When you annotate, you write critical explanations to add extra insight about something. These explanations can be necessary to understanding writings in which the language might be difficult to make sense of without clarification.",
    "long": "The heart of the word annotate is the word note. The Latin annotātus means \"noted down,\" making the word a breeze to remember. A writer will annotate parts that need extra explanation in technical works or classic writings in which the language or concepts might be difficult to grasp. In fact, some works, like James Joyce’s \"Ulysses,\" have entire separate volumes of annotations, and readers must shift back and forth from the novel to the annotations. Now that's a dedicated reader!"
  },
  "adulterate": {
    "short": "If you adulterate something, you mess it up. You may not want to adulterate the beauty of freshly fallen snow by shoveling it, but how else are you going to get to work?",
    "long": "The verb adulterate comes from the Latin word adulterare, which means “to falsify,” or “to corrupt.” Whenever something original, pure, fresh, or wholesome is marred, polluted, defaced, or otherwise made inferior, it has been adulterated. A vitamin company might issue a recall if they learn that one of their products was adulterated during production. And if you hate dried fruit, you might complain that your grandma adulterates her oatmeal cookies with raisins."
  },
  "vicissitude": {
    "short": "When you talk of the vicissitudes of life, you're referring to the difficult times that we all go through: sickness, job loss, and other unwelcome episodes. No one can escape the vicissitudes of life.",
    "long": "While vicissitude comes from the Latin vicis, which means \"change\" and technically can mean a change of any kind, you'll find that vicissitude is almost always used to talk about an unfortunate event or circumstance. Losing a pet, crashing the car, being called in for jury duty: these are examples of vicissitudes — chapters in one's life that one would rather avoid but must get through. Some lives have more vicissitudes than others, to be sure, but no life is without events that test and challenge us."
  },
  "rotund": {
    "short": "Rotund describes anything that's plump or round, like a teapot or your chubby Aunt Agnes.",
    "long": "Rotund describes someone who is round in shape, or obese. It's not a compliment. That's why it's probably okay to call Santa Claus rotund, but not your neighbor — at least not to his face! It's fine to call round things rotund, however, like a rotund vase full of flowers, which particularly makes sense when you know that the root of rotund is the Latin word rotundus,  meaning round, circular, like a wheel."
  },
  "acrimonious": {
    "short": "Locked in a mean-spirited, bitter argument? That's an acrimonious situation that might result in fists flying unless you and your opponent can cool down.",
    "long": "If you're familiar with the adjective acrid, which means \"having a strongly unpleasant taste or smell,\" you might guess that acrimonious probably refers to something unpleasant, too. And you'd be right. Until the mid-nineteenth century, acrimonious meant the same thing as acrid. But while acrid is still most commonly used in a literal sense (as in \"an acrid odor\"), acrimonious is now used to describe things like angry and bitter speeches or debates. Both words come to English from the Latin word  acer, meaning \"sharp.\" Keep sharp objects locked up if a showdown gets too acrimonious."
  },
  "equine": {
    "short": "Equine means having to do with horses. An equine saddle is one used for a horse, as opposed to one for a camel. An equine face is a horse face, and no, that's not a very nice thing to say.",
    "long": "Equine is connected to words that refer to animals—bovine means having to do with cows, porcine pigs, feline cats, canine dogs, etc. Many young girls go through an equine phase, where they are obsessed with all things horse—books, dolls, images, and, last but not least, actual horseback riding."
  },
  "forbear": {
    "short": "When you forbear, you hold yourself back from doing something. If you're mad at your best friend, you might forbear to return her text messages for a while.",
    "long": "If you forbear to giggle during your teacher's stern lecture, that's a good thing. You keep yourself from laughing out loud, even though that's instinctively what you want to do. The Old English root, forberan, means \"control one's feelings, or tolerate.\" A less common way to use forbear is as a noun meaning \"ancestor.\" So  if you're refraining from reading about your ancestors, you can say you forbear to learn about your forbears."
  },
  "apposite": {
    "short": "Something apposite is fitting or relevant. It is apposite that radio stations play Christmas carols on Christmas Eve, and that your tax accountant takes vacation after April 15th. It all makes sense.",
    "long": "The adjective apposite is derived from the Latin terms appositus and apponere. Ponere means to place, and thus apponere is \"well-placed or well-put.\" Don't confuse apposite with opposite; they have almost opposite meanings!"
  },
  "varnish": {
    "short": "Varnish is a shiny coating that's painted on a floor or piece of furniture and then dries clear and luminous. After refinishing an old oak chair, you might apply a coat of varnish. (Just don't sit on it until it's dry.)",
    "long": "Varnish gives artwork, furniture, and other objects a finished, glossy look, and it also protects the surface. Most varnish is made from oil, solvent, and resin. You can also use the word as a verb, meaning \"to coat with varnish.\" Many people decide to varnish their wood floors or their wooden kitchen counters. The Medieval Latin root word is vernix, \"odorous or fragrant resin.\""
  },
  "beguile": {
    "short": "To beguile is to entertain and convince by flattery. Someone who beguiles is tricky and often charming, like when a smooth-talking friend tries to beguile you into giving them your allowance.",
    "long": "The word beguile is from Middle English, and while guile involves deceit, to beguile means to spend time pleasantly, even if it involves trickery. If someone beguiles you for an afternoon, you were amused, entertained, or otherwise pleased. The word can also have a darker tone, as when the person who beguiled you for the afternoon was actually trying to steal your car. Con artists and cat videos tend to beguile people."
  },
  "enormity": {
    "short": "An enormity is something extreme or huge, almost beyond comprehension. If you call having to paint the house all by yourself an enormity, your friends might take pity on you and show up with brushes and rollers.",
    "long": "Something that's enormous can be good — a huge paycheck! — or bad, such as a tumor. But when it comes to enormity, some word lovers are up in arms. The word originally meant \"a crime,\" so some people think it should only be used to describe wickedness or lack of morals. Others can't resist the word's similarity to enormous and apply it to anything vast, positive or negative."
  },
  "ignoble": {
    "short": "Ignoble means not noble, but for those of us that don’t live in feudal England and don’t worry about lords or peasants, ignoble just means base, or low, like that dude in Biology who’s always telling fart jokes.",
    "long": "Ignoble means low, common, or humble, but we tend to use it to describe the lows of human nature, rather than economically humble people or places. So a picturesquely crumbing rustic cottage or a cool old diner is not ignoble, but perhaps a sketchy roadside bar is. Those that think that the human mind is the treasure of the world disdain ignoble animals like pigs or dogs––after all, they can’t compose lovely poems like we can."
  },
  "ornamental": {
    "short": "If something is ornamental, it's a decoration. The red feather in your cap is most definitely ornamental; it serves no purpose other than providing a splash of color.",
    "long": "Ornamental things are, by definition, just for show — they're not actually useful. So an ornamental pond in your yard might be pretty, but you can't fish or swim in it, and an ornamental telephone booth in your friend's living room doesn't really work. Likewise, ornamental plants or gardens are full of beautiful flowers and foliage, but nothing in them is edible."
  },
  "entice": {
    "short": "Let's say your friend wants to go to the movies and you don't want to. Your friend might try to entice you by offering to buy you popcorn and a soda. Entice means to persuade with promises of something.",
    "long": "The word entice means to lure or tempt someone by promising them something that they like. It is a little manipulative but in a fairly straightforward way. You always know it when someone is enticing you. If a company really wants to hire you, they will entice you with a good salary and generous benefits. The promise of a gold star is often enough to entice small children to get good grades."
  },
  "squeamish": {
    "short": "If you fainted or threw up at the sight of frog intestines in biology class, you’re squeamish — easily nauseated or shocked by unpleasant, icky things. No horror movies for you!",
    "long": "We get squeamish from the Anglo-French word escoimous, meaning disdainful or shy. It can mean shy of blood or gore, or less often, it is used to describe a prissy kind of fear of confrontation with others. How can you become a heart surgeon if you’re squeamish enough to faint every time you get a paper cut? If you’re squeamish about confronting the noisy neighbors, why not slip a note under their door asking them to pipe down?"
  },
  "quandary": {
    "short": "How to define the word quandary? Wow, this is quite a dilemma. What to do, what to do? Hmmm. Looks like this moment itself is a quandary: a tough situation that will be really hard to resolve.",
    "long": "If you’re uncertain what to do because all of your options seem unpleasant, you’re probably in a quandary. Some voters find themselves in a quandary when they dislike all of the candidates. A more common quandary is when you plan two events at the same time and can’t decide which one to attend. Some synonyms are predicament, dilemma, plight, and pickle — and choosing which word to use is a quandary in itself."
  },
  "simper": {
    "short": "To simper means to smile in an artificial, coy or self-conscious way. If you hope to please someone by simpering, you may wind up annoying him or her.",
    "long": "The origin of the word simper is not clear, but it is probably Germanic as there are similar words in Danish as well as Middle Dutch. What is clear is that a simper is not attractive to those observing it. Watching your colleague simper and giggle as the boss tells a not-very-funny joke, you can be sure that she is angling for that promotion."
  },
  "withhold": {
    "short": "If you keep something back and don't share it, you withhold it. You can withhold things such as permission, emotion, or information. You might get into trouble if you withhold information from your parents or the police.",
    "long": "The verb withhold means to deduct from a payment and hold back. Your job will withhold money from your paycheck for things like taxes. You may also choose to withhold money from your check for healthcare, retirement, and numerous other voluntary accounts. The past tense of the verb withhold is withheld. Withhold is spelled with a double h because it is made by combining the words with and hold."
  },
  "indelible": {
    "short": "If something is indelible, you better hope you never regret it, like the indelible tattoo of the name of your favorite band or the indelible first impression it might give people you meet years from now, especially if your taste in music changes.",
    "long": "The adjective indelible describes something that can't be erased or removed, like marks made by an indelible marker, or an indelible moment you will never forget, like your first day of kindergarten or the first time you visit a new, exotic place. It comes from the Latin word indelebilis, meaning \"not able to be destroyed.\""
  },
  "doctrinaire": {
    "short": "You've doubtless met someone doctrinaire at some point. You know them by their complete unwillingness to accept any belief other than their own.",
    "long": "If you're familiar with the noun \"doctrine\" — a formal idea or system of belief — you'll have no problem with the adjective doctrinaire. It's a just a way of describing a person or group of people who are set in their ways. Parents can start out doctrinaire, but children soon force them to be flexible in how they bring them up."
  },
  "wheedle": {
    "short": "To wheedle is to sweet talk, or flatter someone in the hopes of getting something in return. You might try to wheedle a meter maid into not giving you a parking ticket. Good luck with that.",
    "long": "If you want your parents to do something for you that they don’t want to do, you may have to wheedle them with breakfast in bed and a shower of compliments in order to get what you want. To wheedle someone is to “charm” that person, though it’s a little more on the “suck up to” side than it is charming. The teacher’s pet might try to wheedle her way into a better grade."
  },
  "obtrusive": {
    "short": "The eight-foot-tall, hot pink statue of Minnie Mouse did not belong among the beige couches of the fancy living room. The statue was obtrusive, meaning it stood out in a bad way.",
    "long": "Something that obtrudes sticks out, like a sore thumb. Wearing a snow suit and skis to your neighbor's pool party, or bringing steak tartare to a vegan potluck — these are examples of obtrusive behavior, which draws attention to you and makes you stick out, but not in a good way."
  },
  "alter": {
    "short": "After eating too many gingerbread cookies, she no longer fit into her uniform, so she had a seamstress alter it. It looked pretty much the same.",
    "long": "The verb alter can also mean to neuter or spay. Think of a cat that has just been spayed: the cat you pick up from the vet is the same cat that you dropped off there, only perhaps a little groggy and unable to reproduce. While the cat has been altered, it's not a different cat."
  },
  "protract": {
    "short": "To protract something is to stretch it out. If you have a disagreement with a friend that you continue for weeks and weeks, you are protracting the argument.",
    "long": "Protract can also mean to draw a plan to scale. Basically when you protract something, you draw it out. You may remember from geometry that a protractor is a device used to draw exact angles. A protractor allows you to protract a plan for the perfect catapult — perfect to use to end a protracted battle."
  },
  "execrable": {
    "short": "If something's execrable it's really and truly, unbelievably, absolutely the worst.",
    "long": "Execrable is often used as a harshly critical term in the arts, when a reviewer really wants to throw the book at something. Not surprisingly, the word comes from a Latin word meaning \"to utter a curse; to hate or abhor.\" Tough words for bad art. Perhaps part of the power and nastiness of execrable lies in the word's similarity to excrement — but that's a vocabulary word we're not touching in this entry!"
  },
  "puerile": {
    "short": "Some people like their movies to have sophisticated humor and others prefer the more puerile humor of pratfalls or jokes about smelly underwear, inappropriate belching, and passing gas.",
    "long": "Although the adjective, puerile can be used to describe anything related to childhood, more often than not, it is used in a derisive manner to comment on the immaturity, silliness, or juvenile nature of something or someone. So if you hear someone talk about puerile toys, they may merely be remarking on the toys of childhood, but it is more likely they are discussing whoopee cushions, fake dog poo, and the like."
  },
  "ridiculous": {
    "short": "Did you just say that you could toss a rubber chicken over an ocean? Don’t be ridiculous, because ridiculous words are hard to believe, and they will make others laugh at you, not always in a good way either.",
    "long": "The adjective ridiculous comes from the Latin word ridere, which means “to laugh,” but it’s also related to the word ridicule, which means to mock in a cruel way. A mocking and cruel laughter, that’s a common reaction to ridiculous situations. However, there are all different kinds of ridiculous, like seeing a fish holding an umbrella while riding a bike."
  },
  "parlous": {
    "short": "Parlous is an adjective that means \"dangerous,\" such as the parlous car trip with a new driver behind the wheel!",
    "long": "The first syllable in parlous rhymes with far and is accented: \"PAR-less.\" It means dangerous — something that is parlous might carry the risk or threat of harm, like a parlous experience of being in a boat during a rainstorm. Parlous and perilous are synonyms. In fact, parlous is a shortened version, or contraction, of perilous that came about in the late 14th century."
  },
  "energize": {
    "short": "Energize means to raise the energy level of something. If your really boring teacher suddenly starts throwing M&Ms to every student with a correct answer, he will energize the classroom.",
    "long": "Ever seen the Energizer Bunny––the one who \"keeps going and going and going?\" It's because he's energized by long-lasting batteries that he has the energy to beat that drum over and over. Someone who's feeling low on energy might be reenergized by a cat nap or a candy bar."
  },
  "opulence": {
    "short": "Something with opulence is drenched in wealth and luxury. You'll need gold brocaded curtains, diamond-encrusted watches, and a world-renowned personal chef if you want to add some opulence to your life.",
    "long": "Not surprisingly, the noun opulence comes from the Latin opulentia, meaning “wealthy.” A word that suggests extravagant excess, opulence describes lavish and visibly over-the-top living. Synonyms include abundance, prosperity, and riches. Said the novelist Joseph Conrad, “Protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury.” Meaning, first secure one’s riches and safety, and then enjoy without a care in the world!"
  },
  "corporeal": {
    "short": "Use the adjective corporeal to describe something that has to do with the body, like when your teacher catches you daydreaming and says you need to bring your mental sharpness, not just your corporeal presence to the classroom.",
    "long": "Corporeal describes something that has a physical form. It is the opposite of spiritual or emotional. Something that is corporeal exists in the real world. It’s sort of a fancy way of saying bodily or physical. So when you crave double-cheese pizza with sausage and pepperoni, you could blame it on a corporeal need. (It’s a way to make junk-food cravings sound a little bit grand!)"
  },
  "ameliorate": {
    "short": "To ameliorate is to step in and make a bad situation better. You could try introducing a second lollipop to ameliorate a battle between two toddlers over a single lollipop.",
    "long": "The verb ameliorate comes from the Latin word meliorare, meaning “improve.” Food drives can ameliorate hunger. An air conditioner can ameliorate the discomfort of a stiflingly hot summer day. A sympathy card can ameliorate grief. Family therapy can ameliorate severe sibling rivalry. Anything that can lift a burden or make something better can ameliorate."
  },
  "emancipation": {
    "short": "Emancipation is being set free from the control of someone or something. Your emancipation from your parents comes when you turn 18 and are legally considered an adult.",
    "long": "The word appears most memorably in the Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham Lincoln's order of 1863 that freed enslaved people in the U.S. Emancipation can describe any kind of liberation: \"If you're really chafing under the rigors of practicing for the upcoming game, you and your teammates can go on strike for emancipation from the grueling schedule your coach has decreed.\""
  },
  "calculate": {
    "short": "To calculate is to compute, by figuring out a mathematical equation or a situation. You can calculate your monthly student loan payments, or calculate the risk of not paying them on time.",
    "long": "Calculate derives from the Latin word for \"count.\" When you calculate, you either count something up or calculate on something happening. You might be able to calculate the answer to a simple equation in your head but need a calculator to figure out a more complex problem. And when someone is calculating, they are scheming or conniving, always figuring out the fastest way to get ahead."
  },
  "benefit": {
    "short": "A benefit is something that helps you, whether in the form of health insurance provided by an employer, welfare given by the government to those in need, or the benefit of the doubt extended to you by a friend.",
    "long": "The Latin bene- \"good\" is at the heart of the word benefit, which derives from the Latin benefactum \"good deed.\" When attendance at a party or an event raises money for a charity, the event is referred to as a benefit in that charity's honor."

  "ambrosial": {
    "short": "",

  },
  "prune": {
    "short": "To prune means to clip, crop, cut back, and weed out. Pruning usually happens to overgrown trees and bushes, but can also be helpful for wild eyebrows and guest lists that are too long.",
    "long": "You may have also heard of another form of prune: the kind you eat. But other than dried plums, the word is generally used in verb form to describe giving something a much needed trim. Gardeners prune plants, cutting back dead branches and weak parts so they can thrive and grow better. Companies prune budgets to cut back on unnecessary spending. And you might need to prune your baseball hat collection if you're running out of places to put them."
  },
  "puncture": {
    "short": "When you puncture something, you make a hole in it. Stick a pin in a balloon and you'll not only make kids cry, you'll also puncture the balloon.",
    "long": "Use the verb puncture to describe poking a sharp object into something. You can call the hole you've made a puncture as well: get a big enough puncture in your car tire and you'll need to call for help. In Latin, punctus means \"to prick or pierce.\" The hardest thing about puncture is knowing how to spell it — remember that there's a c in the middle, and you'll probably get it right."
  },
  "extrapolation": {
    "short": "An extrapolation is kind of like an educated guess or a hypothesis. When you make an extrapolation, you take facts and observations about a present or known situation and use them to make a prediction about what might eventually happen.",
    "long": "Extrapolation comes from the word extra, meaning “outside,” and a shortened form of the word interpolation. Interpolation might sound like a made-up word, but it’s not. An interpolation is an insertion between two points. So an extrapolation is an insertion outside any existing points. If you know something about Monday and Tuesday, you might be able to make an extrapolation about Wednesday."
  },
  "flourish": {
    "short": "A flourish is an extra touch — a trumpet's \"ta-ta-da!\" announcing a king's entrance, a fancy carving atop an otherwise utilitarian pillar, a wave of a flag or a cheerleader's pompom.",
    "long": "Flourish can also mean \"growth\": \"With the right teacher, a child will flourish.\" To understand how the two meanings of flourish connect, remember that the word \"flower\" (spelled flour-) is hiding inside it. Flowers are used for decoration and ornamentation, but they also grow. Get it? Good for you! Imagine a cheerleader shouting out your name, flourishing her pom-poms."
  },
  "ancillary": {
    "short": "If you use the adjective ancillary to describe your position you are subordinate or supporting something or someone else.",
    "long": "The adjective ancillary originally meant \"relating to maidservants\" from the Latin, but the element of a female servant has fallen away and now the word merely refers to a position as helpful or subordinate. An example of how something in medicine can be ancillary is after you have surgery you may also take a drug to aid healing — the drug would be considered ancillary to the surgery. One could also argue that in the United States the vice-president takes an ancillary role to the president."
  },
  "abscond": {
    "short": "Abscond is to escape, often taking something along. As a kid, you may have absconded from your lemonade stand — with the coffee can of cash in hand, and your bewildered sister still filling cups for your customers.",
    "long": "Abscond is generally used to describe someone running from law or capture, and the word abscond has been in use since the early sixteenth century — running away and hiding being nothing new. Dogs who get off the leash and dart into the woods are not necessarily absconding; they are simply making a break for it. On the other hand, the Ponzi schemer who went to live in the South of France with his client's money? He absconded."
  },
  "artful": {
    "short": "To be artful is to do something skillfully, especially in a cunning way. A con man must be artful.",
    "long": "To be an artist requires skill and talent: it's not easy to make art. Similarly, doing something in an artful way takes skill. A chess player is artful in escaping an opponent's attack. A politician is artful in appealing to different groups of people. This word also indicates that the skill shown is a little cunning or sneaky. In movies, villains are often artful, as they tell lies or hatch schemes. Often, artful is the opposite of straightforward."
  },
  "bearing": {
    "short": "When you walk into a room with your shoulders straight and your head up, people might say you have a noble bearing. Bearing is the way you hold your body, and it often means you hold it well.",
    "long": "Bearing has many uses, but they mostly involve support and/or direction. Bearing, for example, is the name given to a mechanical part that supports a moving joint — like a ball bearing. In buildings, bearings are walls or beams that support the building. In the same way, when you carry your body, you are bearing yourself up. Bearing also is used to talk about direction and travel: you could step off the sidewalk and nearly be run over by a car bearing north."
  },
  "dirge": {
    "short": "A dirge is a song of mourning, performed as a memorial to someone who’s died. As you might imagine, a dirge is usually quite sad. Another word with a similar meaning that you might know is “requiem.”",
    "long": "The noun dirge comes from the Latin dirige, which means “direct,” and is the beginning of a prayer that translates as “Direct my way in your sight, O Lord my God.” Dirge can still have a religious meaning, but it can also be any sad and mournful song, poem, or hymn composed or performed in memory of someone who has died. You can also say that something mournful sounds like a dirge, using the word in a more poetic sense."
  },
  "listless": {
    "short": "To be listless is to be lethargic, low spirited, and limp. If a fever has made you feel listless, you might also feel like you are melting into the sofa.",
    "long": "If you went to the supermarket without your shopping list, that doesn't mean you're listless. The word originates from the Middle English word liste which meant desire (and is related to our word lust). Oddly enough, listen comes from the same origin. If you're too lethargic and out of it to listen, you're listless. It's not just laziness, it's not just fatigue; an utter indifference to whatever is going on around you makes you listless."
  },
  "prominent": {
    "short": "If you're looking for an adjective that means \"sticking out above the rest; famous,\" consider prominent. A prominent person might be the big star, the head honcho, the top dog — not just any ordinary person.",
    "long": "A prominence is anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain ridge. Prominent, then, means \"sticking out\" either in a literal sense (\"a prominent nose\") or a figurative one (\"a prominent figure in the industry\"). The metaphorical sense of \"famous\" is the most common one today, so you're more likely to hear about prominent people than prominent noses."
  },
  "odium": {
    "short": "That shivery feeling of disgust and hatred that you get when you see something senseless and horrible is called odium.",
    "long": "Odium made its way into the English language through Latin, and the word’s root od-, meaning “hatred,” might tip you off that this word involves extreme dislike of some sort. Odium is a little more immediate than hate and usually describes a negative response to a specific action rather than a long-held, sustained hatred. Your dislike of broccoli, for example, wouldn’t be described as odium. Instead, think of odium as hate mixed with repulsion and condemnation, what you feel, for example, if you hear a racist speech or a news story about a terrorist act."
  },
  "spendthrift": {
    "short": "A spendthrift person is reckless and wasteful with his money. If you're a spendthrift, you might find yourself in debt. However, it might be fun to have a spendthrift friend who likes to treat you to expensive lunches and lavish gifts.",
    "long": "Spendthrift was created by sticking two opposite words together: spend and thrift, which means “savings, wealth.” So a spendthrift spends all of his savings. Spendthrift people are the worst nightmare of retirement planners and Scrooges all over the globe. So unless you want to be called a spendthrift, think twice about your next purchase."
  },
  "magnitude": {
    "short": "Earthquakes have great magnitude in that they are powerful. Their power is rated by their level of magnitude, or how much energy they release relative to other earthquakes.",
    "long": "In math, magnitude compares numbers by powers of 10. If your weekly allowance was $10, but your brother's was $100, his allowance would be one order of magnitude higher than yours. If your sister's was $10,000, hers would be three orders of magnitude higher. A difference of that magnitude is just not fair!"
  },
  "grandiloquent": {
    "short": "Grandiloquent is a fancy term for, well, being fancy or pretentious. In fact, you might say grandiloquent is itself a pretty grandiloquent word.",
    "long": "The word grandiloquent generally refers to the way a person behaves or speaks. Politicians and schoolteachers are the usual suspects of this manner of behavior, known as grandiloquence, but it can refer to anything that's overbearing or pompous in style or manner. Architecture, especially, is highly guilty of being grandiloquent — if you check out just about anything built in the Baroque style, you could describe it as grandiloquent."
  },
  "communal": {
    "short": "Communal and community both come from Latin communis \"common, of the community\"—if a pool is communal, it can be used by the members of the community that owns it.",
    "long": "A communal well in a town without plumbing is a great idea. Until it runs dry, everyone can take responsibility for caring for their water source. A communal drinking cup is not such a great idea—accompanied as it is by possible infection."
  },
  "consolidate": {
    "short": "Consolidate means to bring together. If you consolidate student loans, you put them all together into one big loan. If you consolidate your childhood toys, you grab them all up and put them in one place. Preferably a toy box.",
    "long": "Consolidate comes from the Latin roots com- (\"together\") and solidare (\"to make solid\"). So, consolidate is to bring things together to make something solid, stronger, or easier to handle. A general might consolidate his troops, a librarian might consolidate his grammar books, and someone with credit-card debt might consolidate the debt from different cards onto one."
  },
  "hypocrite": {
    "short": "A hypocrite preaches one thing, and does another. You're a hypocrite if you criticize other people for wearing fur, but pull out your big mink jacket as soon as it gets cold.",
    "long": "The word hypocrite is rooted in the Greek word hypokrites, which means “stage actor, pretender, dissembler.” So think of a hypocrite as a person who pretends to be a certain way, but really acts and believes the total opposite. Hypocrites usually talk a big talk but fail to follow their own rules — like an outspoken vegetarian who secretly eats bacon."
  },
  "conducive": {
    "short": "Conducive means tending to cause or produce something. Regular exercise is conducive to happiness and a feeling of well-being.",
    "long": "This adjective is usually followed by the preposition to, and it refers to bringing about something favorable or helpful: A positive attitude is conducive to good health. Conducive was formed in English from the less common verb conduce \"to lead or contribute to a result.\" The verb conduce descends from Middle English conducen, from Latin conducere, from the prefix com- \"together\" plus ducere \"to lead.\" And the suffix –ive means \"tending to.\""
  },
  "notoriety": {
    "short": "Notoriety is fame you get from doing something bad or being part of a misfortune or scandal. Just remember: Notoriety's not al-righty. Charles Manson earned notoriety for his grisly crimes.",
    "long": "In our celebrity culture, it's hard not to think that seizing your 15 minutes of fame is worth the shame of earning it through stupidity, scandal, or evil. (See: people's motives for going on reality television.) We ordinary mortals can comfort ourselves with the knowledge that most people who become notorious fade from the public mind quickly."
  },
  "revulsion": {
    "short": "Revulsion means an intense, violent, sometimes physical dislike of something. People feel revulsion to different things. You may feel revulsion at the thought of seeing a horror movie, but other people can't wait to be scared by the latest zombie or slasher flick.",
    "long": "The noun revulsion comes from the Latin word revellere, meaning to pull away or to pull back. So, if you think of pulling back in horror when someone suggests going on a roller coaster after lunch, you'll remember the definition for revulsion is an intense aversion. Synonyms for revulsion include abhorrence, disgust, horror, and repugnance. After getting the stomach flu after eating raspberries, you now feel a revulsion to anything raspberry flavored."
  },
  "objection": {
    "short": "An objection is a way of saying \"No!\" to something. People offer objections to things they oppose.",
    "long": "An objection is a statement of protest. During weddings, you often hear the question \"Does anyone object to this union?\" If someone did, that would be an objection: they think the wedding is a bad idea. In court, a lawyer says \"Objection!\" if they think the other lawyer said something unfair or wrong. A little kid who says \"I don't want eggs!\" is making an objection. Any kind of disapproval is an objection. When there are no objections, people agree."
  },
  "absolve": {
    "short": "To be absolved is to be let off the hook, to be set free from a certain obligation or to be forgiven for a wrongdoing. The Church may absolve you of your sins, but that won't absolve you of the need to attend mass.",
    "long": "The Latin absolvere, which means \"to set free,\" is the root of the word absolve. In the religious sense, to be absolved means to be truly forgiven in the eyes of the Lord, which must feel like being set free. In a more mundane everyday usage, absolve can be used to describe being let off the hook. For instance, putting a campaign poster in your window does not absolve you of the responsibility to vote."
  },
  "extravagance": {
    "short": "Use the noun extravagance when you're talking about something that's over the top, especially when it comes to spending money. Ordering a $500 hamburger for dinner would be an extravagance.",
    "long": "Money is usually the subject when people talk about extravagance, although the word can also mean having too much of something, whether it's anger or flowery wallpaper. In Latin, the root word extravagari means \"wander outside or beyond,\" and originally extravagance was used to describe something that was unusual — \"wandering outside\" the norm. It wasn't until the 1700s that the word became associated specifically with spending too much money."
  },
  "zealot": {
    "short": "The hamburger zealot was so fanatical about his burgers that he camped outside his favorite fast-food joint for hours every morning, waiting for it to open. And he would never put mustard on them, only ketchup.",
    "long": "The original zealots were a group of first-century Jews who were absolutely determined to overthrow Roman rule in Palestine. Today, anyone who goes overboard in their zeal, or enthusiasm, for a particular cause, a religion, a sports team, or a charitable organization — can be called a zealot. The coffee lover was a zealot regarding where his coffee was grown, who grew it, and how it was roasted."
  },
  "gestation": {
    "short": "Gestation is the period of time when something is conceived and developed. The gestation period for human babies lasts nine months.",
    "long": "Gestation comes from the Latin gestare, which means to bear, or give birth to. We can talk about the gestation of fetus before it's born, but we also use gestation to talk about ideas. If you've been vaguely thinking about starting a revolution for the last year, then that idea has been in gestation."
  },
  "errant": {
    "short": "Something or someone described as errant has gone astray or done wrong by going in an unexpected direction. An errant bird might end up in northern Canada while his friends fly to southern Mexico for the winter.",
    "long": "Although errant is commonly used as a synonym for \"misbehaving\" or \"naughty,\" it also refers to things that are just out of place. An errant bomb can hit a house instead of an army base, and an errant lock of hair can get in your eyes. Errant can be intentional, as in \"the errant boys skipped school to go to the movies,\" or unintentional, as in \"an errant snowball hit your neighbor instead of your arch enemy.\""
  },
  "congenial": {
    "short": "A congenial person is  easy to get along with. If you're trying to decide which of your friends to take on a road trip, choose the most congenial one.",
    "long": "Congenial means sharing the same temperament, or agreeing with your temperament.  You can talk about a congenial person, place, or environment. Maybe you enjoy the congenial atmosphere of the library. Or perhaps for you the disco is more congenial.  As you might expect for such a vaguely approving word, there are many synonyms: agreeable, pleasant, delectable, delightful, enjoyable, and so on."
  },
  "reminiscent": {
    "short": "If your uncle tells you that your outfit is reminiscent of the way your mother dressed when she was young, it means your clothes remind him of your mother. Hopefully that doesn't mean your mother is still dressing you.",
    "long": "Reminiscent traces back to the Latin for \"remember.\" If a house is reminiscent of your childhood home, it makes you remember your childhood home. Reminiscent can have a good or bad implication. If you tell someone that her paintings are reminiscent of a chimp's finger paintings, obviously that's not so good. But if you tell her that they're reminiscent of Dali, well that might be better."

  "insensible": {
    "short": "The adjective insensible is used to describe someone who is unconscious. If you keep your bowling ball on the top shelf of the closet and it rolls out and conks you on the head, you will probably be rendered insensible.",
    "long": "The adjective insensible describes a lack of emotional response or being indifferent. If your friend says that the roller coaster was so scary it nearly made him vomit and you shrug and say, \"Eh, it was okay,\" he may think you are insensible to fear. A lack of physical sensation can also be described as insensible. If your nerve endings are not acute and you don't feel much pain, you are insensible to pain. This can be dangerous, though, because you might not notice if you get hurt skateboarding."
  },
  "treatise": {
    "short": "A treatise is a formal written paper about a specific subject. It’s like an essay but longer. A treatise is usually about a serious subject, so you might read a treatise on democracy, but you probably won't read a treatise about chewing gum.",
    "long": "The word treatise is related to the verb treat, in the sense of \"deal with,” like the way a doctor treats a patient. Like a doctor, a treatise examines a subject from all angles. It has nothing to do with treats, unless you’re writing a treatise on desserts, which would be weird. More appropriate topics for a treatise include philosophy, religion, economics, and so forth. An example of a political treatise is The Prince by Machiavelli, which basically argues that “the ends justify the means.”"
  },
  "exacerbate": {
    "short": "For a formal-sounding verb that means to make worse, try exacerbate. If you're in trouble, complaining about it will only exacerbate the problem.",
    "long": "Exacerbate is related to the adjective acrid, often used to describe sharp-smelling smoke. Think of exacerbate then as a sharp or bitter thing that makes something worse. A drought will exacerbate a country's food shortage. Worsen, intensify, aggravate and compound are similar, but exacerbate has the sense of an irritant being added in to make something bad even worse."
  },
  "pedantry": {
    "short": "You know that person who is always interrupting other people, correcting their grammar or their facts? That's   pedantry, or inappropriately showing off your knowledge.",
    "long": "The noun pedantry refers to the behavior of a pedant, which comes from the French word pédant, meaning “schoolmaster.” While it is a schoolmaster's job to ensure that students learn, someone who is guilty of pedantry just seems to brag, using his or her knowledge to get attention or seem better educated than the people around him or her."
  },
  "collywobbles": {
    "short": "If you have a case of the collywobbles, then chances are you should stay home and close to the bathroom. Collywobbles is severe gastroenteritis that may send your lunch on a rocky round trip through your digestive system.",
    "long": "Many common illnesses have the look of a plural but the behavior of a singular (mumps, measles, hives) and collywobbles follows the pattern. The OED describes the origin of the word as a 'fantastic formation' of colic and wobble. That would be fantastic not in the \"incredibly wonderful\" sense but in the \"based on fantasy\" sense."
  },
  "grouse": {
    "short": "A grouse is a plump little bird. Don’t like birds? You can grouse, or complain, about them. The word grouse means both, but a grouse wouldn’t grouse because birds don’t whine.",
    "long": "The word grouse has been around since the 1500s, referring to a ground-dwelling game bird with feathery feet and legs. It’s a bird, so people hunt it, which is maybe how grouse came to mean “to complain” a few hundred years later. You might grouse about the amount of homework your social studies teacher assigns or about the terrible weather or about the high price of gas. People will grouse about pretty much anything!"

    "short": "To be averse to something is to be opposed to it on moral, philosophical or aesthetic grounds: my father is averse to people wearing shoes in the house, but he would not be averse to people wearing house slippers.",
    "long": "Averse comes from a Latin word, aversus, which means \"turned away from.\"  To be averse to something is to shun it,  turn away from it, or dislike it.  Some people are averse to the use of cilantro in any food that comes near them, some others are averse to wearing itchy wool sweaters, and others are averse to any form of exercise.  Aversions are really very personal."
  },
  "fidelity": {
    "short": "Fidelity is the quality of being faithful or loyal. Dogs are famous for their fidelity.",
    "long": "Fidelity comes from the Latin root fides, which means faith, so fidelity is the state of being faithful. Marital fidelity is faithfulness to your spouse. If you're a journalist, your reports should have fidelity to the facts.  Someone without fidelity to a religion or group belief is called an infidel."
  },
  "ensign": {
    "short": "Use the noun ensign when you talk about a Navy officer. An ensign's rank is just below lieutenant and above a non commissioned petty officer or midshipman.",
    "long": "The lowest ranking commissioned officer in the US Navy is an ensign, and it's a similar position in the British infantry as well. You can also use the word to describe a country's flag or another symbol that represents a particular nation. For example, you might say that a ship displays the Norwegian ensign when it flies the flag of Norway. Ensign is a Scottish word that comes from the Old French enseigne, \"mark, symbol, flag, or pennant.\""

  "veteran": {
    "short": "Veteran commonly refers to someone who has fought in a war––think Veterans' Day, the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial––but, in fact, the word can mean anyone with experience in a particular field.",
    "long": "Many veterans of World War II went to college afterward, through the G.I. Bill, and pursued professional careers. At the end of those careers, it was not unusual to find among the ranks of veteran teachers or veteran attorneys or veteran doctors men who were also veterans of the war."
  },
  "centrifugal": {
    "short": "The physics principle whereby objects are forced to move out from the center is called centrifugal force. This apparent force is activated by something moving in a curved direction; the heavier the object the stronger the force.",
    "long": "The word centrifugal is from the Latin centrum, \"center,\" and fugere, \"to flee,\" so the word means \"center-fleeing.\" Centrifugal force was studied by physicists as far back as 1629, and the term itself was used by Sir Isaac Newton, in its Latin guise vis centrifuga, in 1687."
  },
  "inadvertently": {
    "short": "Inadvertently is an adverb that means \"without knowledge or intent,\" like when you inadvertently take someone else's coat from the coatroom because it looks just like yours.",
    "long": "When you do something inadvertently, you don't mean to do it — you might inadvertently step in a puddle, leave something important at home, or hurt your friend's feelings. Some things that happen inadvertently aren't mistakes, though: They happen by chance. For example,  if you just happen to park your car at the exact place that blocks a bus from hitting a pedestrian, you've inadvertently saved a life."
  },
  "allegation": {
    "short": "An allegation is an accusation, which is sometimes true and sometimes not. If you say your sister stole a candy bar but you don't have any proof that she did it, you have made an allegation.",
    "long": "In the legal system, an allegation is a formal claim against someone. It sparks an investigation that leads to someone being proven innocent or found guilty. In everyday use, however, an allegation is what someone thinks, whether or not there is proof. For example, if someone makes an allegation that you're a terrible driver, they might base it on their own experience, but they won't be able to prove it."
  },
  "imprudent": {
    "short": "To be imprudent means lacking self-restraint when it would be wise to have it, like that time you started dancing on the table during a math test. Remember that? Everybody else does.",
    "long": "Prudent means \"wise or shrewd,\" but add the prefix im- meaning \"not,\" suddenly you have an adjective that describes the opposite of being wise or shrewd. An imprudent person doesn't think about the consequences and might cross the street without looking both ways or use a curling iron while taking a bath. Careless, wild, imprudent behavior can get you into big trouble!"
  },
  "immutable": {
    "short": "If you can't change it, it's immutable. There are many things in life that are immutable; these unchangeable things include death, taxes, and the laws of physics.",
    "long": "The adjective immutable has Latin roots that mean \"not changeable.\" The Latin prefix for not is in, but the spelling changes when the prefix is put before the consonant m. It is im before a root word starting with m as in immutable. If you learn this rule, you'll know the immutable fact that immutable begins with i-m-m."
  },
  "proliferate": {
    "short": "When something proliferates, it's growing, spreading or multiplying really quickly. Bunny rabbits have a habit of proliferating, as do dandelions in untended gardens and funny YouTube videos on the internet.",
    "long": "Proliferate was originally a biological term used to describe the growth of cells and producing offspring. It wasn’t until 1961 that we started to use proliferate more generally to talk about everything from the spread of nuclear weapons to the wide growth of Walmart. Other similar words include expand, reproduce, snowball, and spawn."
  },
  "captor": {
    "short": "Someone who catches a person or animal and keeps them confined or imprisoned is a captor. Visiting the zoo, you might find yourself wondering if the lions see the zookeepers as friends or as captors.",
    "long": "The word captor sounds a little bit like capture, and it's no coincidence — they're both rooted in the Latin capere, \"to take, hold, or seize.\" So if you capture a cricket and keep it in a little cage, you are its captor. And, when a police force captures a criminal and puts them in prison, the police become captors too. The original meaning of captor was actually \"a censor.\""
  },
  "artifice": {
    "short": "If a politician pretends to be angry as a way of rousing the anger of the voters and getting more votes, he's guilty of artifice — a subtle and crafty trick.",
    "long": "Before taking on its current meaning, artifice meant a skilled piece of workmanship.  A beautiful diamond bracelet might have been considered a piece of artifice, for example; now it would only be called artifice if the diamonds were fake."
  },
  "discriminate": {
    "short": "When you discriminate between two things, you can tell the difference between them and can tell them apart.",
    "long": "The ability to discriminate between similar objects is important. For example, if you want to be a good root farmer, it helps if you can discriminate between a turnip and a parsnip. However, some people take it too far and discriminate against other people, treating them differently based on their physical characteristics or abilities. To be able to discriminate between a turnip and a radish is good, but to discriminate against people is not."
  },
  "clot": {
    "short": "A clot is a mass of coagulated blood. It's your body's way of repairing itself, stopping blood from flowing and beginning to heal a wound.",
    "long": "You can use the noun clot for any liquid that forms a solid lump or mass, though it's usually a medical term specifically related to blood. Some clots are useful, like the ones that form on skin that's been cut, while others — like those that occur inside blood vessels — can be harmful. Clot can also be a verb, meaning to clog or coagulate. The root is the German word Klotz, which means \"lump or block.\""
  },
  "foment": {
    "short": "Stand outside the school cafeteria passing out flyers with nutritional details on school food, and you may foment a revolution — foment means stirring up something undesirable, such as trouble.",
    "long": "You would never say, \"Hooray, we fomented a revolution.\" Instead you'd say, \"Those good for nothing scalawags fomented the rebellion.\" Don't confuse foment and ferment. Ferment can mean \"to stir up\" in a good way — a football game can ferment excitement in a town, or foment trouble through traffic tie-ups and litter."
  },
  "grand": {
    "short": "Something that's grand is large and impressive. A fancy, catered birthday party with a guest list of hundreds could be described as grand.",
    "long": "The adjective grand can be used in many different ways: it can describe big things, like a grand piano or the Grand Canyon, or luxurious things, like the grand leather seats in your dad's Cadillac. You can also use grand to simply mean \"wonderful,\" as when you exclaim, \"Chocolate cake for dessert! Isn't this grand!\" Grand is also a slang term for \"a thousand dollars.\" The Latin root is grandis, \"big, great, full, or abundant.\""

  "jest": {
    "short": "A jest is a joke. Are you a playful prankster? A jocular jokester? A witty wisecracker? Then you are definitely well versed in the art of the jest.",
    "long": "To jest means to banter and joke in a playful way — like a \"court jester,\" whose job it was in medieval times to entertain the royal court with funny stories. Today when we jest we generally joke around or gently tease. The noun's meaning evolved over time, from \"idle tale\" to \"mocking speech,\" and finally to \"joke.\""
  },
  "extricate": {
    "short": "If you need to be untangled, set free or otherwise released from something or someone, you need to be extricated.",
    "long": "Extricate is a mixture of the prefix ex, which means \"out\" or \"out of,\" and the Latin word tricae, which means \"hindrances.\" So to extricate is to get out of what's hindering you. But it's not always so simple. You just try and extricate yourself from the loving death grip of a grandma who hasn't seen you in awhile!"
  },
  "resemble": {
    "short": "Have you noticed that many pet owners resemble their pets? Or is it that pets resemble their owners? Either way, it’s downright strange how they often look alike.",
    "long": "Derived from the old French word sembler, “to appear,” the verb resemble can imply a whole spectrum of likeness. For example, you might closely resemble your schnauzer or, hopefully, only vaguely resemble each other. It’s not just about appearance, either. This concept can include all kinds of characteristics. Two companies can resemble each other and the same could be said of two philosophies."
  },
  "optician": {
    "short": "The person who makes your eye glasses is an optician. They work in the back room of the glasses shop, or at a factory, fabricating the lenses and attaching them to the frames.",
    "long": "While an optician can determine whether you are nearsighted or farsighted, if you have a medical eye problem, you probably want to visit an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Both of these are eye doctors, but the latter has completed full medical training and has chosen eye health as a specialty."
  },
  "acute": {
    "short": "Use the adjective acute for when you want to describe something as sharp or extremely serious.",
    "long": "The word acute is one word; it's not two words, nor does it have anything to do with something small, cuddly, and pretty! Acute really means \"sharp\" or \"severe\" or \"intense\" and modifies certain kinds of angles in geometry or describes a certain kind of illness of short duration. The English word apparently entered the language during the sixteenth century from the Latin root acutus, which means \"sharp\" or \"pointed.\""
  },
  "domain": {
    "short": "If you have a place that's all your own, somewhere real or in cyberspace that has your name all over it — literally or figuratively — it's your domain. And if you have something you really excel at, that is your domain too. You own it.",
    "long": "A domain used to mean only land owned by wealthy people, such as lords in the 15th century, but modern usage is much wider, or has a broader domain in the English language. On the Internet, a domain is a space with a specific address, but a domain can also have a physical address, like a home. It can be a specialty, too, as in, \"The main domain of the art school was sculpture,\" or \"She was so good at math that algebra became her domain.\""
  },
  "agnostic": {
    "short": "If someone believes they cannot know whether or not God exists, that person is an agnostic. Your grandmother might be a devout believer, while your mom is agnostic.",
    "long": "In 1869, English biologist T.H. Huxley coined this noun referring to someone whose religious beliefs lie somewhere in between those of a theist and an atheist — that is, a believer and a disbeliever. Huxley combined the Greek prefix a-, meaning \"not,\" with gnostos, \"known.\" This word can be used as a noun or  adjective, and it can also refer to uncertainty about questions other than the existence of God: \"Some philosophers remain agnostic as to whether people have free will.\""
  },
  "provocative": {
    "short": "If something is provocative, it provokes a reaction. A provocative book might get people talking about a controversial idea. A provocative statement, such as \"I hate babies,\" will get another kind of reaction.",
    "long": "The action, thought, or feeling is often a desired one, called forth on purpose. In fact, provocative is often used to describe actions or ways of dressing that cause sexual feelings. But provocative things can also call forth something unwanted: \"She was angered by the provocative remarks.\" This adjective was borrowed from French provocatif, from Late Latin provocativus \"calling forth,\" from Latin provocare \"to call forth, challenge.\""
  },
  "blank": {
    "short": "Something that's blank is empty or undecorated. A blank canvas hasn't been drawn or painted on yet — it's clean and unmarked.",
    "long": "A blank computer screen has no information on it, and a blank look on someone's face is completely free of any expression, revealing nothing. If your mind goes blank during a job interview, you are left without any thoughts for a moment. When blank is a noun, it means \"a line to be filled in\" or \"an empty space.\" In the 1500s, a blank was the empty, white center of a target, from the French word blanc, or \"white.\""
  },
  "potent": {
    "short": "Potent means really strong, but not like a body builder. Use potent instead to describe things like intense smells, powerful magic potions, and very influential people.",
    "long": "From the Latin potentum, meaning “powerful,” potent is just that: having tremendous strength or influence in either a moral or physical sense. A potent question gets to the heart of the matter and sparks serious discussion. Really stiff drinks can be potent, as can your breath after a garlicky meal. And as the composer Igor Stravinsky once asked, \"What force is more potent than love?\""
  },
  "usury": {
    "short": "Usury means lending money at exorbitant interest rates. Some people think that credit card companies charging annual interest rates of 29% are guilty of usury.",
    "long": "A good way to remember the meaning of usury is that you can hear the word use in there. Think of charging too much interest as a way of \"using\" someone. The sad thing about high interest is that it's always the people who can least afford it who are charged rates so high that it amounts to usury. In the old days, if someone was found guilty of usury, they'd be severely punished."
  },
  "pusillanimous": {
    "short": "You can describe someone who lacks courage as pusillanimous, such as a pusillanimous student who is too afraid to speak out against someone who is bullying others.",
    "long": "Its Latin origin — pusillus and animus — tells us that pusillanimous means \"very small spirit.\" If you are pusillanimous, pronounced \"pew-sill-AN-ih-mus,\" you don't have the spirit — or the confidence or drive — to step up when it matters. The pusillanimous person stays quiet, doesn't get involved, waits for someone else to take a stand — not out of laziness, but out of fear."
  },
  "ridge": {
    "short": "A ridge is a long, narrow, elevated strip of land or any raised strip or band. A ridge is a line that rises above what it is attached to.",
    "long": "Think of a ridge as a combination between rim and edge. From the Old English hrycg, meaning “back of the man or beast” or “the top or crest” of something (combined, the senses mean “backbone”), ridge is often used for the beam that joins the parts of a sloping roof. Ridge also refers to the line formed by hills or mountains, as in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is made up of mountains that lie underneath the Atlantic Ocean."
  },
  "charter": {
    "short": "What do rock gods do when they travel? They charter their own plane, of course. Charter means you rent or lease a particular service or object. Anyone can charter something, though lesser mortals tend to limit themselves to buses.",
    "long": "Charter comes from the Latin charta, meaning \"paper, card or map.\" As a noun, charter refers to a written document outlining — or mapping — the rights and obligations of a company or organization, or even, in older days, a town or entire colony. New York City was given a charter, for example, by the British monarch in the 17th century, guaranteeing it certain rights in exchange for goods and services. Today corporations still have charters governing their behavior."
  },
  "depreciate": {
    "short": "Something depreciates when it loses value. If you bought shares of a company for $10 each a year ago and now they’re worth $1 each, guess what: they have depreciated.",
    "long": "One of the most frustrating things about buying a car is the way it loses value. As soon as you drive it off the lot, your new car has already depreciated by several thousand dollars. Though usually used like this as a financial term, depreciate can also be used as the similar-sounding but unrelated word deprecate meaning \"to belittle, lower in esteem.\" Your teachers should not depreciate you just because you don't always know the answers to their questions!"
  },
  "indigence": {
    "short": "Indigence is a synonym for extreme poverty. If you experience indigence, you have a critical need for food, money, and other resources.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce indigence, accent the first syllable: \"IN-dih-genz.\" It means \"great lack of material resources,\" like money. Indigence a noun, and indigent, an adjective, are related words that have to do with need. If you are indigent — suffering from extreme poverty — you are living in indigence, the state of extreme poverty."
  },
  "vagary": {
    "short": "A vagary is an unexpected and unpredictable change, and the word is usually used in the plural. You might know from experience that the vagaries of winter weather make planning a vacation in February a risky proposition.",
    "long": "Vagary traces back to the Latin root meaning \"wander,\" and you can think of a vagary as something that wanders. Events or situations that seem to change at random have vagaries. Whether the hottest new boy band will succeed or not is dependent on the vagaries of teenage enthusiasms. The  vagaries of the real estate market will determine whether that swamp property you just bought is a gold mine or a disaster."
  },
  "flamboyant": {
    "short": "Flamboyant means elaborate and ostentatious. When you think of flamboyant, think of Las Vegas showgirls: feathers, sequins, three-inch heels, enough make-up to disguise any irregularity.",
    "long": "Flamboyant means showy, and though we often roll our eyes at it, it's not a hateful thing. Liberace was flamboyant. So was Elvis. The word comes from the French flamboyer, to flame. Think of passion and pageantry all rolled into one, and you'll have a good idea what flamboyant should mean at its best. If that doesn't do it for you, think of a man playing a shiny white grand piano at a rock concert, wearing a white satin jump suit and 8-foot wide, fully-feathered wings. See? Flamboyant."

  "diaphanous": {
    "short": "If a dress is so see-through that light shines through it, it's diaphanous. You could also call it \"sheer\" or \"transparent,\" but diaphanous sounds much fancier.",
    "long": "If you want a classic example of diaphanous clothing, check out all those nineteenth century Romantic paintings of goddesses clad in lightweight gowns flouncing around in the middle of forests at night. Those gowns are diaphanous, and so are the fluttery translucent muslin curtains in your kitchen window and the gauzy tutu your little sister loves to wear. The Greek root, diaphanes, \"see-through,\" combines dia-, \"through,\" and phainesthai, \"to show.\""
  },
  "savant": {
    "short": "You know that girl in your school with a GPA over 100? She is a savant in the making. A savant is someone over-the-top smart, a scholar. It might take a savant only five minutes to do an entire math test.",
    "long": "Savant is the French word for \"learned\"  and it goes back to the Latin word \"to be wise\", sapere. In English, a savant can be someone is who is wise and learned in general, or someone who is extremely skilled in a particular area, like your little brother who can rattle off the first three hundred digits of pi."
  },
  "complaisant": {
    "short": "If only the world were populated entirely with complaisant people! Complaisant means willing to do something to please others, and complaisant people or animals are wonderful to be around.",
    "long": "Don't confuse complaisant with its near-homonym complacent. Both derive from the Latin complacere \"to please,\" but while complaisant means willing to do something to please another, complacent means smug and self-satisfied, something that you want to avoid when you're on the winning team."
  },
  "conjecture": {
    "short": "Can you guess what conjecture means? It's a word to use when you are not sure of something and have to \"guess or surmise.\"",
    "long": "You can see how the word conjecture means that you create a theory or opinion about something without basing it in fact because the original definition of conjecture, from Old French, is \"interpretation of signs and omens.\" Since signs and omens are pretty subjective, it makes sense that the word would then move to its current meaning. However, even though it only seems like weather reports are conjectures, they are actually based on evidence!"

  "nominal": {
    "short": "Schools, libraries, and other organizations often ask you to make a nominal donation to their cause. While you want to support many causes, these nominal donations soon add up to a substantial portion of your budget!",
    "long": "Another meaning for the adjective nominal is \"in name only\" or only having a title. The CEO is the nominal head of the company, but you know his assistant is one who is really in charge of the day-to-day business of the company. He is the go-to person for signing invoices, purchase orders, and resolving personnel issues."
  },
  "pathetic": {
    "short": "Something pathetic inspires pity and contempt. If your backhand is pathetic, you probably shouldn't try out for the tennis team.",
    "long": "These days, when you see the word pathetic, it's pretty clear that it's no compliment. This is an insulting word for things that are so bad they bum you out. A sports team losing ten games in a row is pathetic. Someone who constantly lies, even though the lies are obvious, is pathetic. Trying to dunk a basketball and missing by three feet is pathetic. When something is astoundingly lame or awful, people love to say, \"Wow. How pathetic.\""

  "abstemious": {
    "short": "Reserve abstemious for someone who exercises restraint, especially with regard to alcohol. A rock musician may sing about enjoying wine and women, but in his private life he may be abstemious.",
    "long": "You might get the idea that abstemious is a relative of abstain with a change of consonant, but in fact the two words only share the abs- prefix, meaning \"away.\" The -temious bit in this adjective is from Latin temetum, \"intoxicating drink,\" so it came to refer to someone who keeps alcohol (or other temptations) at arm's length. This word has the vowels a, e, i, o and u in alphabetical order; the adverb abstemiously adds the y!"

  "article": {
    "short": "A piece of non-fiction prose written for a publication is one kind of article.",
    "long": "But a piece of a collection of something is also an article, like an article of clothing. If you're talking grammar, definite and indefinite articles are words, such as a, an, and the, whose purpose is to indicate, specify and limit a noun.  An article of faith is something that is firmly believed. And an article of organization or incorporation is a section of a legal document that sets out rules for a company."

    "long": "You'd think the word unremitting would be connected to the word remit, but that's true in only a loose way. Remit means to send back––but if you remit a debt, you forgive it, or lift it. Unremitting describes something that is never lifted or sent back. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps coming and coming and coming."

  "equable": {
    "short": "The adjective equable means \"not easily irritated\" or \"steady,\" like someone's equable manner that makes everyone instantly feel comfortable.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce equable, accent the first syllable: \"EK-wah-bul.\" It comes from the Latin word aequabilis, meaning \"equal, consistent, uniform.\" An equable person isn't moody. You wouldn't expect him or her to fly into a rage one minute and be humming a happy tune the next. Instead, someone who is equable takes things in stride — the good, the bad, and the ugly, with a smile and the occasional reminder that \"this too shall pass.\""

  "relegate": {
    "short": "Relegate means \"to assign to a lower position.\" If the quarterback of the football team stops making decent throws, he might be relegated to the position of benchwarmer.",
    "long": "Relegate rhymes with delegate — both words derive from the Latin legare, \"to send.\" Relegate means to send someone down in rank. Delegate means to send someone in your place to complete a task. In the workplace, managers who can't figure out how to delegate may get relegated to a lesser rank."
  },
  "insouciance": {
    "short": "Insouciance is a feeling of careless indifference. There's a certain amount of lightheartedness in insouciance, but rather than merely being cheerful, someone with insouciance truly couldn't care less.",
    "long": "Insouciance has roots in the French in, meaning \"not,\" and se soucier, meaning \"to care,\" giving the English word its \"uncaring\" meaning. Insouciance can be a positive state — like the childlike insouciance you feel when you are watching cartoons instead of paying your bills. However, insouciance is not always so sunny. Young voters are often accused of treating the right to vote with insouciance, meaning they just can't be bothered."

  "relish": {

    "long": "The word relish has been around since the 16th century and comes to us from the French, who are pretty good at indulging and savoring. When at a dinner party, win points with your host by sighing happily after each bite to show just how much you relish the meal. Relish is also a kind of spicy or savory condiment, the stuff you slather on hotdogs or hamburgers. So if you're fickle when it comes to pickles, you might ask them to hold the relish."

  "squalid": {
    "short": "Squalid things appear neglected, or morally repulsive in nature, like a frat house after a semester of hard partying and zero cleanup.",
    "long": "Squalid comes from the Latin word squalare, meaning to “be covered with a rough, scaly layer.” A few word evolutions later and we have squalid, a word that describes something distasteful, dirty, unattractive, and as unkempt in appearance as the dry, scaly skin of an armadillo, or a room filled with pizza boxes, flickering light bulbs, and stained wallpaper. Squalid behavior is dirty, too, like cheating on a test and lying about it."

  "reconnaissance": {
    "short": "Reconnaissance is checking out a situation before taking action. Often it’s used as a military term, but you could also do reconnaissance on a new employee before you hire her, or a resort before you take a vacation.",
    "long": "Reconnaissance is a noun, and it technically means “the act of reconnoitering.” Whoa. Never heard that word before? Reconnoitering is just a fancy way of saying that you’re checking something out — sometimes in a sneaky way. If you like a girl in your Spanish class, you might ask a friend to do some reconnaissance to find out what she’s like. The word comes from the French reconnaître, which means “recognize.”"

    "long": "Scurvy has some alarming symptoms: your gums become soft and tender and your teeth fall out. Scurvy has become a rarity in most parts of the world, but in regions where food is scarce and malnutrition common, it's still a problem.

    "short": "A predisposition is a tendency to do something. If you know you have a predisposition toward getting carsick, better to plan ahead and avoid eating before a long drive.  Things could get ugly.",
    "long": "Predisposition comes from the Latin prae meaning \"before,\" and disponere meaning \"put in order, arrange, distribute.\" If you have a predisposition to think or act a certain way, you can anticipate your reaction before it happens.  A genetic predisposition means you are likely to inherit a trait from your parents. Someone might have a genetic predisposition to diabetes or to another illness."

    "long": "The original meaning of indulge is \"to treat with unearned favor.\" That's why it doesn't mean the same as reward. Instead, when you indulge, you enjoy or take part in something just because you want to — like indulging in a celebrity gossip magazine: you know you should be doing something more constructive, but you don't care. When you indulge someone else, you go along with whatever they want to do."

    "short": "If you're somnolent, you're feeling sleepy or drowsy. It's best to avoid operating speedboats or motorcycles when you're somnolent.",
    "long": "Somnolent comes from the Latin word somnolentia, meaning sleepiness, which in turn is from the Latin root somnus, for sleep. You can feel somnolent, or describe something as somnolent. As an adjective it describes something that is likely to induce sleep, like a boring movie in an overheated theater, or the low, somnolent lighting in a museum exhibit of fragile, old illuminated manuscripts."
  },
  "regulate": {
    "short": "The on-off spigot regulates the flow of water into your bathtub. When a government regulates an industry, they set standards the industry must follow. To regulate means to impose control.",
    "long": "Regulate shares a root with the word, regular. When the transit authority regulates a train schedule, it makes sure trains arrive on a more regular schedule. The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated –– before a drug can be marketed, it must be tested. On a more personal level, if you want to regulate your digestive system, try eating more fiber... or prunes!"
  },
  "qualm": {
    "short": "A qualm is a feeling of uneasiness, or a sense that something you're doing is wrong, and it sounds almost like how it makes your stomach feel. If you had qualms about taking candy from the bulk bins at the store, your conscience probably told you to go back to the cashier and pay.",
    "long": "Qualm entered English in the 16th century, with meanings like \"doubt\" and \"uneasiness.\" Usually a qualm comes from doubt about an action and a feeling that you are doing, or are about to do, something wrong. It isn’t a bad feeling about another person's behavior but about your own. If you have qualms about lying to get into the over-18 dance club, you might decide to follow your gut-check and meet your friends for coffee instead."
  },
  "opportune": {
    "short": "Use the adjective opportune to describe especially good timing. A snowstorm is an opportune time to make extra money shoveling your neighbor's driveway.",
    "long": "You can see the word opportunity in opportune. Both words come from the Latin word opportunus, meaning \"favorable,\" which itself is derived from a phrase that describes wind blowing toward a port. Just as the wind helps speed ships toward shore, something that is opportune offers favorable circumstances for accomplishing something or doing something."
  },
  "precursor": {
    "short": "You've heard the old saying \"Pride comes before the fall?\" Well, you could just as easily say pride is a precursor to the fall. A precursor is something that happens before something else.",
    "long": "You don't have to be a dead languages scholar to guess that this word springs from a Latin source — praecursor, \"to run before.\" A precursor is usually related to what it precedes. It's a catalyst or a harbinger, leading to what follows or providing a clue that it's going to happen. Binging on holiday candy is a precursor to tummy aches and promises to exercise more. Draconian policies in unstable nations are often a precursor to rebellion."
  },
  "refract": {
    "short": "Things that refract light — like lenses and prisms — bend it. If you've looked through a water droplet on a car windshield, you've seen water refract light.",
    "long": "You're most likely to come across the verb refract when you're studying physics and the properties of light waves. We come across examples of this everyday, though — when you study a straw in a glass of water, you see the water refract light in a way that makes the straw look bent or jagged. A rainbow also happens when raindrops refract light, breaking it into its component colors. In Latin, refract means \"broken up.\""
  },
  "ambivalent": {
    "short": "If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself ambivalent about it.",
    "long": "Ambivalent means \"having mixed feelings about something.\" A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word Ambivalenz in the early twentieth century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix ambi-, meaning \"both,\" with valentia, \"strength.\" So etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things — but in practice, ambivalence often arises from caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless tofu."
  },
  "blight": {
    "short": "A blight is a disease that hurts plants and makes their leaves wither. It can also affect neighborhoods. Urban blight refers to a part of the city where things are falling apart.",
    "long": "Blight rhymes with bright, but it’s the opposite of sunshine; instead of making plants grow, it cripples them. The Irish Potato Famine was an example of a blight. In 1845, more than a third of the potato crops were ruined. The plants turned black and their leaves dried up and people who relied on potatoes for most of their meals also withered and experienced extreme hardship and hunger. You might want to think of it this way: a blight makes people — or plants — fight for their lives."
  },
  "chagrin": {
    "short": "Chagrin is a noun that represents an emotion or feeling and it's an uncomfortable one. If you feel chagrin, it means that you are embarrassed or distressed as a result of a failure.",
    "long": "The word chagrin, a noun, comes from the French word of the same spelling and means \"melancholy, anxiety, vexation.\" An odd fact about the word in English is that it had been thought to be related to another, similar-sounding word, shagreen, \"rough, untanned leather.\" When one mistakes one word as a relative of another, it's called \"false etymology.\""
  },
  "affirm": {
    "short": "To affirm something is to give it a big \"YES\" or to confirm that it is true.",
    "long": "The verb affirm means to answer positively, but it has a more weighty meaning in legal circles. People  are asked to swear an oath or affirm that they will tell the truth in a court of law. Lawyers may ask people to affirm facts, and judges may affirm rulings. In these cases, affirm means to verify or attest to the validity of something."
  },
  "dissolution": {
    "short": "The dissolution of a relationship means that it's broken up or ended. The dissolution of your band means you better get started on your solo album.",
    "long": "Dissolution comes from the Latin word dissolutio, meaning \"a dissolving of something.\" Dissolution looks very similar to \"dissolve,\" so to help you remember the meaning, think about what happens if you put paper in water — it breaks apart. A dissolution of a marriage is the same thing as divorce. Although it sounds like disillusion, if you try to use them interchangeably, your logic will fall apart."
  },
  "syncopated": {
    "short": "In music, rhythms or beats that are unexpected or sound \"off\" in an interesting way are syncopated. Typically, a syncopated beat puts the stress where it wouldn't usually be.",
    "long": "When your ear is expecting a weak beat and instead hears a strong or stressed one, it's syncopated. This adjective can also describe rhythms that are uneven or that disturb the flow of music and take it in a different direction. As a verb, syncopate means to make music with this kind of rhythm and also to \"shorten words by omitting syllables,\" from the Greek root synkope, \"contraction of a word.\""
  },
  "contrive": {
    "short": "When you contrive, you make a plan or a plot. It may take you longer to contrive your way out of doing your homework than would to actually do it.",
    "long": "Even though contrive often has a false or cunning feel to it, it is not always a bad thing. Mental effort is always required though, as contrive is often used in connection with inventing schemes and plans to make something happen. Contraption, a complicated mysterious device that does something, is related to contrive. Have you ever seen a Rube Goldberg contraption? When you contrive to do something, your plan may end up being that complicated."
  },
  "quivering": {
    "short": "Quivering means trembling. If your dog begins quivering with fear whenever someone knocks on your door, he's not much use as a guard dog.",
    "long": "When something's shaking gently, like a candle flame shivering slightly in a breeze, you can describe it as quivering.  On a windy day, you might see the leaves of trees or the ruffled feathers of a bird quivering in the wind. There are a few theories about the origin of the word quivering including the possibility that the word quiver was developed onomatopoeically — or creating a word that sounds like its meaning, like a vibrating kind of shiver."
  },
  "philanthropic": {
    "short": "Something given to help others is philanthropic. Money, household items, giving your time and energy to a cause — all can be philanthropic contributions.",
    "long": "Philanthropic, pronounced \"fill-an-THRAW-pick,\" comes from the Greek word philanthropos \"loving mankind, useful to man.\" Philanthropic organizations work to help people, running their operations by relying on resources donated by people who are able to give. Many charities, museums, universities, cultural centers, and scientific institutions rely on philanthropic support to pay their bills."
  },
  "pedantic": {
    "short": "There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is pedantic makes a big display of knowing obscure facts and details.",
    "long": "Pedantic means \"like a pedant,\" someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality.  It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off book learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the opportunity to bore you with his in-depth knowledge of 18th-century porcelain kitty-litter boxes."
  },
  "transmute": {
    "short": "Transmute is a verb meaning to change in appearance or form. For example, magical creatures can transmute into other beings. When you're fighting a wizard, don’t be surprised if he transmutes into a terrifying dragon.",
    "long": "More realistically, you, too, can transmute your appearance — by dying your hair, piercing your nose, or changing your style of dress. Transmute often describes physical change — like when alchemists tried to transmute lead into gold — but it can also be used more figuratively to describe anything that's transformed. For example, you might transmute your sketchy memories of growing up in Boston into the Great American Novel."
  },
  "carnivorous": {
    "short": "Vegetables? Forget it. If you're into eating meat, meat and more meat, then you're carnivorous.",
    "long": "Not surprisingly, the adjective carnivorous can be traced back to the Latin word for \"flesh.\" Carnivorous eaters get their fill of other animals, so they've also got a reputation for being savage or predatory. So anyone who stalks around like a lion on the hunt could also be described as carnivorous, even if they're a card-carrying vegetarian."
  },
  "neonate": {
    "short": "A neonate is a newborn baby. New parents are usually excited and a little nervous to bring their neonate home from the hospital.",
    "long": "Use the noun neonate when you need a medical term for a tiny baby, specifically one that's younger than a month old. Hospitals have neonate units and neonate nurses, and what a doctor might refer to as a neonate, you'd probably just call an infant or a baby. Neonate combines the Greek prefix neo, or \"new,\" and the Latin natus, \"born.\""
  },
  "didactic": {
    "short": "When people are didactic, they're teaching or instructing. This word is often used negatively for when someone is acting too much like a teacher.",
    "long": "When you're didactic, you're trying to teach something. Just about everything teachers do is didactic: the same is true of coaches and mentors. Didactic is often used in a negative way. If you heard that a movie is overly didactic, that's probably not good. Most people want to see a story and be entertained when going to the movies, and if it feels like the movie is just telling you what to think, that's didactic in a bad way."

  "grudging": {
    "short": "If you do something in a grudging manner (or grudgingly), you do it with reluctance. Doing homework, paying taxes, and saying sorry are all commonly done in a grudging manner.",
    "long": "\"Grudging apology\" and \"grudging acceptance\" are probably the two most common uses of this word, which perhaps says something about our lack of grace as a species. The word derives from the medieval French word groucher, meaning \"to murmur or mumble.\" A related word is grudge, meaning a long-lasting sense of ill will dating to a previous incident."
  },
  "ordained": {
    "short": "Ordained means invested with the authority to act as a priest. Once you are ordained as a priest, you are ready to take over that little country church and start tending to the flock.",
    "long": "Ordained comes from the root meaning \"order,\" and when you are ordained, you're brought into the religious order, or group of church leaders. We also use ordained for declarations. If it has been ordained that all people must now wear plastic birds in their hair, then that new fashion command has been declared by an authority. Sometimes people talk about fate as \"what has been ordained.\""
  },
  "prevalent": {
    "short": "Something prevalent is common in a particular place at a particular time. Prevalent things are hard to avoid. When you see the word prevalent, think \"It's everywhere!\"",
    "long": "Have you ever noticed how all of a sudden a new word, band, or hairstyle will become super-popular? You may never have seen those things before, and then suddenly they're prevalent. When something is common, it's prevalent. You could say drug use is prevalent among criminals. You could say good study habits are prevalent among good students. If a certain opinion is common, then that's a prevalent view in society."
  },
  "irrevocable": {
    "short": "If you're on a diet but eat one tiny piece of chocolate, it might start an irrevocable slide into bad eating. Describe something as irrevocable if it cannot be undone or taken back.",
    "long": "If you break down irrevocable, you wind up with ir \"not,\" re \"back\" and vocable from the Latin vocare \"to call.\" So if something is irrevocable, you cannot call it back — it is permanent. You must fulfill an irrevocable promise and live with an irrevocable decision. A law is irrevocable if it states within the law that it cannot be nullified. Now that's final!"
  },
  "astronomical": {
    "short": "If you lie down on a big field or on a rooftop and look up, the sky is so wide and high, it is astronomical in size — bigger than huge. Everything in that sky, including the stars and planets, is also astronomical because it is part of a science called astronomy.",
    "long": "Astra and aster are the Latin and Greek words for star, and the first four letters of astronomical, a-s-t-r, are a scramble of the word star. Astronomy includes the study of stars, but planets and other objects and happenings in space are also part of astronomical studies. Considering how large everything in space is, it makes sense that very, very large or uncountable things sometimes get the description astronomical."

    "short": "A manuscript is a handwritten work. It's still a manuscript if it's typed — if a publisher asks for your manuscript, don't send her something scrawled on notebook paper!",
    "long": "The noun manuscript evolved from the Latin manu scriptus, meaning “written by hand.” Manu is “hand” and scriptus is “to write.\" It refers to old documents actually written by hand before books were made, but it can also refer to a writer's unpublished work whether it's handwritten or typed. Samuel Johnson said, “Your manuscript is both good and original, but the part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good.” Harrumph!"
  },
  "putative": {
    "short": "You might be the putative leader of your lacrosse team, even if someone else holds the title of captain.  Putative means to be known as something by reputation, or assumed to be something, or generally accepted.",
    "long": "Every once in a while, a putative planet is reported in the news, which we get very excited about and which usually turns out to be an illusion. But in 2005, an astronomer discovered what appears to be a new planet beyond Neptune. But is this putative planet for real? There is always some doubt — something not quite official — about putative things."

  "abbreviate": {
    "short": "To abbreviate is to shorten. Words are often abbreviated, like when we say sked instead of schedule.",
    "long": "Though we most often think about words being abbreviated — especially terms like OMG and LOL for \"oh my God\" and \"laugh out loud\" — lots of things can be abbreviated. You just have to shorten them. Sudden rain might abbreviate a baseball game. A bomb threat would abbreviate a school day. Anytime something is being shortened or cut, abbreviation is going on."
  },
  "insolent": {
    "short": "Someone who's insolent is either really doing her own thing, even if it goes against what everyone else is doing, or she’s mildly disrespectful.",
    "long": "That student in your class who is constantly snubbing the teacher, snorting when he gives assignments, and rolling her eyes when he reads passages aloud from your vocabulary textbook? Insolent, definitely insolent. There might be another student who adorns her school uniform with pins and ribbons, cuts her hair shorter than the dress code allows, and rolls her socks down. This student is also insolent, in the sense that she defies the rules."
  },
  "invert": {
    "short": "When you invert something, you turn it upside down, whether it’s an idea or a test you place face-down on your desk when you are finished.",
    "long": "Invert comes from the Latin word invertere, which means \"to turn.\" For example, you might invert a cake pan, turning it upside down on a plate in order to remove the cake. Or if you have a long-standing belief, say, that cats make bad pets, spending time with a really great cat may make you turn that belief upside down, inverting it. And you might even get a cat of your own!"
  },
  "feline": {
    "short": "You can describe your kitten as your young feline friend, since feline describes anything having to do with cats.",
    "long": "The adjective feline is useful when you're talking about cats — just as canine describes dogs, and ursine describes bears. You might talk about the special feline food and toys you buy for your pet, or describe his feline beauty. You can even describe a person as feline, if something about him or her is catlike. The Latin root felinus means \"of or belonging to a cat,\" from feles, \"cat.\""

  "stake": {
    "short": "A stake is a wooden stick, sharpened on one end and used to mark property lines (or slay a vampire).",
    "long": "In the Middle Ages, people would gamble by placing their bets on wooden posts, or stakes.  Eventually the bets themselves became known as stakes.  Today, you can use the word as a verb to describe any risky endeavor — for example, \"Geoffrey staked his sandwich-making reputation on a six-foot hero with salami and pickles.\"  A stake can also be an investment.  If you say that \"Bill has a stake in the business,\" it means he’s a part-owner."
  },
  "nondescript": {
    "short": "Nondescript is a word used to describe something that isn't special or unusual in any way. You might have trouble finding a nondescript apartment building because it looks exactly like every other apartment building around it.",
    "long": "You could use the word nondescript to describe your blind date if she was completely uninteresting and dull, both in looks and personality. Some houses are so nondescript that you have to drive by several times just to make sure it's the right one."
  },
  "invective": {
    "short": "Invective is harsh, abusive language, like \"you dirty rotten scoundrel.\"  I'm sure you can think of harsher and more obscene examples, but we won't get into them here.",
    "long": "Invective comes from the Latin for \"abusive.\"  It kind of sounds like a harsh word, actually, with those sharp, dagger-like V's.  People usually put a colorful verb or phrase before it. Some examples: \"She spewed invective,\" \"She hurled invective,\" \"She burst forth into invective.\"  You can follow it with a phrase like, \"picking up her plate and throwing it across the room.\""
  },
  "convivial": {
    "short": "Use the adjective convivial to describe your friend who is \"the life of the party.\"",
    "long": "The Latin word convivium means \"a feast,\" and when convivial was first coined in the 1660s, its meaning related to the excess of food and drink during such celebrations. You can also see convivial in convivere, meaning \"to carouse together.\" Just when it seemed all convivial could ever do was describe people who overindulge, a new shade of meaning emerged: loving to be around people. After all, a big part of feasting is being with people you care about."
  },
  "coherent": {
    "short": "Something coherent is logical and clear. \"I told you if you didn't do your homework you couldn't watch TV. You didn't do your homework so you can't watch TV.\" This is a coherent argument (and annoying as well).",
    "long": "The thing about such coherent arguments, as your Mom well knows, is that they are also easily and clearly understood. If someone speaks coherently, they are speaking clearly and lucidly. A slight variation on the meaning comes in the sense of something that is united clearly as a whole and a recognizable entity. You might say, for example, that New York City is a \"culturally coherent region\" within the United States."

    "long": "When you demystify things, you remove any mystery or secrecy connected with them. You might feel the need to demystify complicated or difficult ideas, subjects, or tasks. A car repair class can demystify the idea of working on your own engine, and traveling to France often helps language learners demystify the French language. To mystify is to bewilder or perplex, from the Latin root mysticus, \"mystical, mystic, or secret.\""

  "amity": {
    "short": "The word amity refers to a peaceful, friendly nature, much like the French word ami, or \"friend.\"",
    "long": "From the Latin amicus, \"friend,\" amity means \"friendly relations.\" That strong sense of friendship lends irony to the name of the book, and later the movie, called The Amityville Horror, about a horrifying town with a weirdly cheerful name.

The crime scene photos showed the results of actions so flagitious you could not bear to look at them."

  "diffidence": {
    "short": "The noun diffidence refers to a lack of self-confidence. Your diffidence might be the reason why you never say \"hi\" to the cute guy or gal in the elevator or why you never ask for a raise.",
    "long": "The noun diffidence comes from the Latin word diffidere, meaning \"to mistrust\" or \"to lack confidence.\" Diffidence is often mistaken for snootiness because people don't understand that the diffident person is shy and lacking in confidence. \"They asked him to be the team leader, but he expressed diffidence, saying that he didn't think he had enough time to do the job justice, nor did he think he had enough experience.\""

    "long": "Resolute describes certainty. When someone is resolute, things get done: plans are made and carried out. But add the prefix ir to resolute and you get its opposite. An irresolute person isn't necessarily a slacker — he or she just doesn't know what to do. Maybe it's confusion. Maybe it's a matter of waiting for better information to come along. Either way, if someone is irresolute, you'll need to be patient — or willing to nudge him or her into action."

  "berate": {
    "short": "A strong verb for harshly cutting someone down with words is berate. \"He didn't just correct the cashier who gave him the wrong change — he started to berate her, calling her names in front of the whole store.\"",
    "long": "When you berate someone, you do more than just raise your voice at them; berate implies putting someone down by insulting their character. This word comes from a 16th-century English and French root meaning \"to scold or blame.\" Often the anger behind the scolding seems over-the-top, as in \"When the young man behind the counter dropped the scoop of vanilla, the manager berated him excessively by declaring him worthless and weak.\""

The word promulgate comes from the Latin word promulgatus, meaning \"make publicly known.\" Someone can promulgate values, belief systems, and philosophies — it just means they're promoted or made public. For example, you might write an article to promulgate the benefits of eating only organic foods."

    "long": "An anodyne doesn’t have to be actual medicine. If the pure joy of helping your friend is soothing enough to make you forget your aching back, that counts as an anodyne too (though perhaps an unlikely one). Anodyne can also be used as an adjective to describe something that relieves pain, or is at least inoffensive. When you’re stressed out or unhappy, try looking at anodyne pictures of kittens. Er, unless you had a bad experience with a cat once."

  "ludicrous": {
    "short": "Ludicrous things are funny, absurd, or nonsensical. If someone says something silly or far-fetched, you could say \"That's ludicrous!\"",
    "long": "Ludicrous originally meant something that was funny, playful, or joking: a ludicrous comment was just a really funny comment. Over time, ludicrous took on a more negative flavor. Now a ludicrous statement might be funny, but it's also ridiculous, hard to believe, off the wall, or even stupid. When people say \r\n\"That idea is ludicrous!\" it usually means the idea could never happen: the notion is laughable. Saying Neil Armstrong was the third President would be a ludicrous statement."

    "long": "The adjective visible also means obvious to the eye. You'd use this sense if you want to point out obvious flaws in an object such as a car with visible dents and scratches. A third meaning for the adjective is easily available or accessible: You may try to be a visible presence in your kids' lives — although sometimes they would prefer that you blend into the woodwork — so that they know they can count on you and come to you with any problem."

People who have guile are also thought of as being wily (which is also a related word), sneaky, and deceitful.

    "long": "This is a word for people and things that will not change direction. An inexorable person is hard-headed and cannot be convinced to change their mind, no matter what. You can also say that a process, like the progress of a deadly illness, is inexorable because it can't be stopped. A speeding train with no brakes is inexorable; it's not stopping till it crashes. When you see the word inexorable, think \"No one's stopping that.\""

  "surfeit": {
    "short": "Steve baked a surfeit of jam tarts. Steve ate a surfeit of jam tarts. Steve surfeited himself on jam tarts. Whether surfeit is a noun or a verb (as in \"overabundance\" or \"gorge\"), Steve is likely to end up with a bellyache.",
    "long": "Overabundance, glut, gorge, and cloy: these are all synonyms for surfeit, and they all convey a  sense of too-much-ness, as does the Old French root of the word — surfaire, \"to overdo.\"  When it is used in reference to food or eating, surfeit tends to suggest indulging to the point of sickness or disgust. In other contexts, though, the meaning is not necessarily negative: \"A surfeit of kindness,\" for example, would hardly be a bad thing."
  },
  "proverb": {
    "short": "If your Aunt Nellie is fond of sayings like \"All's well that ends well,\" and \"A penny saved is a penny earned,\" then she's a proverb expert. A proverb is a short, catchy phrase that expresses a true or useful idea.",
    "long": "Most proverbs have been around long enough, and endlessly repeated, that they are commonly seen as telling an important truth. People tend to use proverbs to give advice, the way you might say \"practice makes perfect\" to encourage your little brother to keep trying when he's learning to ride a bike. The Latin root proverbium combines the prefix pro with verbium, which together mean a word that you put forward, or a common saying."
  },
  "panoply": {
    "short": "A panoply is a collection or an assortment of things. You might be eager to show off your panoply of bobble-head dolls when friends come to your house.",
    "long": "An array or display of things is a panoply, so you can show off your panoply of spooky clown paintings, but you can also display a panoply of dance moves or talk about the panoply of flags at the parade — as long as it's a complete or impressive display, it's a true panoply. In ancient Greece, the word was used exclusively to talk about military costumes which were always suits of armor."
  },
  "ecstatic": {
    "short": "The adjective ecstatic turns the noun \"ecstasy\" into a descriptive word. When Celine hit that high note, the audience was ecstatic.",
    "long": "Originally, ecstatic had religious connotations having to do with the sheer joy of knowing God or someone truly holy. That meaning remains today, but ecstatic now includes almost anything that's really pleasurable or wonderful. I was ecstatic at the news that I'd been nominated for an award. The entire world reacted with an ecstatic sense of glee when the Berlin Wall finally came down. The hangover the next day, though, wasn't so ecstatic."
  },
  "bristle": {
    "short": "A bristle is a stiff hair — the kind men shave off their face or the kind badgers have all over. Bristle also means to get angry. Tell an animal rights activist you use a badger's bristle shaving brush and you'll get the idea.",
    "long": "The emotional meaning of to bristle comes from the fact that most animal bristles used by man are so-called erectile hairs — the ones that stand up on the neck or along the back of animal when it's angry or surprised. A common word associated with bristle is hackle, another name for such erectile animal hairs. Thus the saying \"to get one's hackles up,\" which is pretty much identical to bristling."
  },
  "incontrovertible": {
    "short": "When something is incontrovertible, it is undeniably, absolutely, 100 percent, completely true. That rain is wet is an incontrovertible fact.",
    "long": "If you look at incontrovertible, you see that -controver-, as in controversy, is hiding inside. Add in the prefix, and it's easy to see that incontrovertible means there is no controversy about something, or, in other words, it is unchangeable and true.  Incontrovertible evidence or proof is what you are looking for if you suspect that someone is doing something wrong."
  },
  "cache": {
    "short": "Cache sounds like what it is, a stash, and sometimes people — usually the criminal type — have a cache of stolen cash.",
    "long": "Often the phrase \"weapons cache\" is used of a bunch of hidden guns or weapons that have been hidden or stored away, which is logical, given that the French verb cacher means \"to hide.\" Sometimes things aren’t really hidden but are stored away out of sight for use later. Computers even cache data and directories to retrieve when needed. So a cache is anything from a stash of cash to a store of information on reserve."
  },
  "unobtrusive": {
    "short": "Use the adjective unobtrusive to describe something that doesn’t attract much attention, like an unobtrusive waiter who doesn't interrupt diners to rattle off the nightly specials, or an unobtrusive stain on the floor that your parents haven't noticed.",
    "long": "When you need to blend in, look to the word unobtrusive, which is pronounced \"un-ob-TROO-sive.\" Unobtrusive can describe anyone — or anything — that is not very noticeable, such as the unobtrusive black parka that makes you look more or less like everyone else on the city streets in winter, or the unobtrusive security cameras at your bank."
  },
  "valiant": {
    "short": "It was pretty courageous of the automaker Plymouth to name a car the \"Valiant\" in the 1960s and 70s because that term usually refers to a hero or describes a really determined, or valiant, effort that doesn't end well.",
    "long": "Synonyms for valiant include \"heroic\" and \"courageous,\" so it isn’t surprising that those who serve in the military often are called valiant. The 14th-century French origins of the word are \"bold\" or \"of worth,\" which makes the adjective valiant a good one for describing ordinary people who put all they have into something, making their efforts valiant, even if they fail. The Plymouth Valiant, by the way, was considered a strong and successful car, though valiant usually refers to people."
  },
  "humble": {
    "short": "Humble means \"modest; without an excess of pride.\" A person who brags about being humble may have too much pride in being humble to actually be humble.",
    "long": "Sometimes fictional characters try to earn favor by saying \"I'm just a humble man in search of...\" when it is obvious they are the opposite. Truly humble people keep quiet about their accomplishments and the good things they do. Humble can also mean \"low in station or quality.\" If you come from a humble background, you didn't grow up wealthy, and if you live in a humble apartment, it isn't overly grand or showy."
  },
  "plumb": {
    "short": "To plumb a body of water, you measure its depth. To plumb a house, you connect all of its pipes. To make carpentry plumb, you get it exactly vertical.",
    "long": "Originally, the verb plumb only meant “to measure the depth of water.” These days, if you “plumb the depths” of something, you go in deep for knowledge and experience: your Heidegger seminar may plumb the depths of German Existentialism like Jacques Cousteau plumbed the depths of the ocean."
  },
  "incinerate": {
    "short": "See incinerate and think: \"burn, baby, burn!\" Whether it’s an old love letter that makes you sad or a terrible picture of yourself, it might be better just to incinerate it, meaning, you burn it.",
    "long": "When you burn something beyond recognition, you incinerate it, as its Latin origins in incinerare, or \"into ashes\" shows. Once you incinerate something, that’s pretty much all that’s left: ashes. The word has a formal feel and is often used to refer to the removal of waste material — your city might incinerate garbage, for example — but you can use it any time you need to reduce something to ashes."
  },
  "preen": {
    "short": "When a bird or a cat preens, it smooths its feathers or cleans its fur. When you preen, you primp and pay careful attention to how you're dressed and groomed, as if you're inviting the whole world to watch you.",
    "long": "You can also preen just by puffing yourself up and congratulating yourself for something. You've just landed your triple flip on the ski jump, and, as you swoosh to a stop at the foot of the hill and take off your skis, you preen as you make your way through the adoring crowd."
  },
  "pertain": {
    "short": "To pertain is to be relevant or somehow associated with something.  If you're a lawyer, you try to find evidence that will pertain to the case and eliminate anything that is not connected.",
    "long": "Behind the verb pertain lies the Latin verb pertinēre, which means \"to be applicable\" or \"to hold through.\"  If you think the rules of the road don't pertain to you, try explaining that to the state trooper when you get pulled over.  Usage note: The word pertain often takes an s at the end, as in \"That pertains to this matter,\" but loses it with a helper: “That doesn’t pertain to it.”"
  },
  "abnegate": {
    "short": "The verb abnegate means to deny or renounce something. Scientists abnegate the existence of little green spacemen from Mars.",
    "long": "The verb abnegate also means to surrender a position of power. If you serve on too many committees, you may need to cut back. You could abnegate the treasurer position for P.T.A., in order to have more time to serve as president of Band Boosters. What's the difference between abnegate and abdicate? Both mean to renounce power or authority, but abdicate is usually reserved for higher offices of power. The king abdicates the throne. The CEO, who gives up day-to-day responsibility? He abnegates responsibility."
  },
  "amend": {
    "short": "When you amend something, you correct or improve it. If you confused your audience when you gave your speech, don't be afraid to amend what you said.",
    "long": "Amend can also describe adding amendments to an official document, such as a constitution or law. If politicians in your state want to address the growing number of home foreclosures, they might amend the state constitution to include restrictions intended to reduce foreclosures. Amend comes from the Latin word emendare, meaning \"to correct, free from fault.\""
  },
  "limp": {
    "short": "If you walk unevenly, you have a limp. Maybe you pulled your hamstring at the annual Thanksgiving Day Football Showdown, or maybe one leg is three inches shorter than the other. Whatever the reason, if your gait is off kilter, you limp.",
    "long": "You can have a limp (the noun), or you can limp (the verb), and both mean that for some reason your legs don’t work quite in synch. Limp can also be an adjective that means \"not strong or firm,\" like your friends' limp response to your invitation to come help paint your house or when your hair looks limp, meaning it's just hanging, with no volume or style."
  },
  "infinitesimal": {
    "short": "When it's incalculably small, when teensy seems large compared to it, then it is infinitesimal. \"The equipment was so sensitive that even the infinitesimal dust molecules that swept in with the open door altered the readings.\"",
    "long": "Infinitesimal is such an extreme description of a microscopic something that the word is used as an exaggeration more often than to describe something actually quite small. \"The chances of Roxy going out on a date with Norbert were infinitesimal. She barely even knew he existed.\" Infinitesimal is derived  from the root infinite, which usually conjures up thoughts of immeasurably large quantities or sizes. But in this case, infinite connotes something immeasurably small."
  },
  "construct": {
    "short": "To construct things is to build them. You might construct a sand castle the next time you're at the beach, or you might construct a theory about why your brother always manages to get away with breaking the rules.",
    "long": "The verb construct comes from the Latin word constructus, meaning “to heap up.” If you work in construction you're in the business of building things, and you probably construct buildings, roads, municipal parks, and other large permanent structures. Students of psychology are familiar with the noun form of construct, which refers to an abstract concept. Much of psychological theory is founded on constructs — like gender, morality, and intelligence."
  },
  "disturb": {
    "short": "To disturb is to bother. If you hang a \"Do not disturb\" sign on the outside of your hotel room door, you want to be left alone.",
    "long": "Disturb comes from the Latin prefix dis-, meaning \"completely\" and turbare, meaning \"to disorder.\" To disturb is, in a sense, to completely disorder. When you disturb something, you interfere with its normal function. Along those lines, it's also a word used to describe the interruption of sleep or relaxation. Your alarm disturbs you from sleep every morning. When something disturbs you, it can also cause you emotional anxiety.  A horror movie might disturb you with its goriness."
  },
  "circuitous": {
    "short": "Circuitous means indirect or roundabout. If you're already late for school, you'll want to take the straightest, fastest way there, not a circuitous one!",
    "long": "Circuitous comes from the Latin word circuitus meaning \"a going around.\" If you're being circuitous it's like you're going around and around in circles. It can also refer to someone's manner or speech, if they are not being direct. For example, if you want someone to get you another piece of cake, but just you sit there looking longingly at your empty plate and talking about how delicious cake is, then you're being circuitous. And annoying."
  },
  "hectic": {
    "short": "Things that are hectic tend to be happen quickly and all at once — that's why a hectic day makes people nervous.",
    "long": "Think about a calm, beautiful island with the sun shining and nothing to do but read a book. That kind of peacefulness is the opposite of hectic. When things get hectic, people sometimes say things are getting crazy or bananas: events are happening too fast for us to keep up, so we tend to get agitated or even angry. Because there's so much work to do, being a student is often a hectic job."
  },
  "mawkish": {
    "short": "Mawkish means excessively sentimental or so sappy it's sickening. Which is how you'd describe two lovebirds gushing over each other or your grandma’s cooing and cheek pinches.",
    "long": "The adjective mawkish came into vogue in the 1600s. Oddly enough, it's rooted in the Middle English word maggot and originally meant “sickly or nauseated.” But mawkish eventually evolved to mean something so overly sentimental it makes you sick. It's not a word you hear very often these days, but feel free to use it to describe really lame love poems and annoyingly mushy Valentine's Day cards."
  },
  "foppish": {
    "short": "A man who is constantly checking out his outfit in the mirror might be foppish, or someone who loves dressing up in fancy clothes.",
    "long": "For some reason, foppish is almost always used to describe men (not women), and that's why the word might make you think of an elegant suit, vest, and tie, and probably some over-the-top details like a flower in a buttonhole and a polka-dotted handkerchief. The word foppish also implies that this guy probably thinks he looks pretty good."
  },
  "resurgent": {
    "short": "Something resurgent comes back to life or is reinvigorated. An old song's popularity might be resurgent after it's featured on the soundtrack of a popular new movie.",
    "long": "When things fall out of favor or stop being active and then experience a burst of energy or interest, they're resurgent. After a period of very conservative political control, resurgent liberal beliefs could lead to a progressive president being elected. And if people get bored with new technology and gadgets, there may be a resurgent interest in hardcover books and Polaroid cameras. In Latin, resurgere means \"rise again.\""
  },
  "chimera": {
    "short": "A chimera is something you’ve imagined that’s bits and pieces of other things mashed together into a new horrible fantasy, something impossible in real life that only exists in your mind.",
    "long": "In Greek mythology, a chimera is a monster that has a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a serpent’s tail.  And it breathes fire. No creature like that has ever existed, but the idea seemed real and terrifying to Greeks, and that’s another meaning: an idea that feels real but is impossible, like the idea of a world without evil.  Pronouncing the word is very possible though; just try it one of two ways: either kye-MEER-uh or kih-MEER-uh. Both work."
  },
  "aesthetic": {
    "short": "The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal.",
    "long": "Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning \"perception,\" comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has \"aesthetic value,\" it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an \"aesthetic painting.\""
  },
  "halfhearted": {
    "short": "Use the adjective halfhearted to describe something that's unenthusiastic, uninterested, or grudging. A pitcher's halfhearted throw of the baseball isn't too likely to end up being a strike.",
    "long": "When you're halfhearted about the book you're reading, you may put it down mid-way through and never pick it up again, and a halfhearted audition for a play isn't likely to earn you a starring role. This noun, sometimes spelled with a hyphen, half-hearted, comes from the idea that if only half your heart is invested in something, you're not very excited about it. In the seventeenth century, the adjective half-headed was also common, meaning \"stupid.\""
  },
  "curtail": {
    "short": "To curtail something is to slow it down, put restrictions on it, or stop it entirely. If I give up cake, I am curtailing my cake-eating.",
    "long": "Curtail is an official-sounding word for stopping or slowing things down. The police try to curtail crime — they want there to be less crime in the world. A company may want to curtail their employees' computer time, so they spend more time working and less time goofing around. Teachers try to curtail whispering and note-passing in class. When something is curtailed, it's either stopped entirely or stopped quite a bit — it's cut short."
  },
  "irksome": {
    "short": "If your little brother keeps saying the same phrase over and over again, you might find it irksome — that is, annoying in a tiresome way.",
    "long": "If you are a person who likes to know exactly where words come from, you might find it irksome that the etymology of irksome's 15th century ancestor irken is unknown. If you complain about this to all of your friends, they might start to find you irksome also."
  },
  "municipality": {
    "short": "If you live in a town or city that has a mayor or other officials who govern it, you live in a  municipality.",
    "long": "The word municipality comes from the Latin municipium, meaning \"free city.\" A municipality has its own government, but sometimes municipalities join together to share services. For instance, two neighboring municipalities might decide to share a single recycling center in order to cut costs."
  },
  "menace": {
    "short": "If it's threatening you or otherwise posing some sort of danger, then it's a menace. Angry rabid dogs, smog clouds, and annoying little brothers are all probable menaces.",
    "long": "The word menace works as both a noun and a verb, but it wasn't used to describe threatening or bothersome people until 1936. Before then, common menaces probably included things like the plague, locusts, and roving bands of pirate ships. Today, a bad reputation can menace an otherwise promising career, weeds can menace your garden, and burglars are a menace to society."
  },
  "nuance": {
    "short": "Use nuance to refer to a very small difference in color, meaning, or feeling. What makes singers brilliant is not how loud they can sing a note, but how many nuances they can evoke through their approach.",
    "long": "Pronounced \"NOO-ahns,\" this noun was borrowed from French in the 18th century and derives ultimately from Latin nūbēs \"a cloud.\" Think of clouds––subtle gradations in color to understand this word. When you say a work of art was nuanced, it means there was a lot to it, but incorporated subtly."
  },
  "hackneyed": {
    "short": "Hackneyed is a word for language that doesn't pack a punch since it's overused and trite. \"Roses are red, violets are...\" — enough already?! That's hackneyed stuff.",
    "long": "Hackneyed is usually used to describe tired writing, but you can also refer to the hackneyed plots of television sit-coms or the hackneyed jokes of your Uncle Fred. But, most often, you will see hackneyed before the word phrase to refer to a specific cliché that is annoying the heck out of someone."
  },
  "override": {
    "short": "You can override or reject a decision if you're more powerful than the person who originally made the decision.  And Congress has the power to override or nullify the Presidential veto if they have a two-thirds vote.",
    "long": "The word override can be used in a number of contexts. You can override or ride on top of the grass. You can override a horse, or ride it too hard. An army can override or dominate the enemy in a war. And a judge can override or set aside a decision in court.  Regardless of which meaning you're using, remember that the thing doing the overriding always has the upper hand."

  "shading": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "plethora": {
    "short": "Plethora means an abundance or excess of something. If you have 15 different people who want to take you on a date, you have a plethora of romantic possibilities.",
    "long": "Plethora comes from the Greek for \"fullness.\" Although it was originally used only in old-fashioned medicine to describe the condition of having too much blood, we use it to talk about any excessive supply.  If you run a theater and all the seats are taken, that's a full house. But if the seats are full and people are standing in the aisles, you have a plethora of patrons. The stress is on the first syllable: PLETH-uh-ruh."
  },
  "petition": {
    "short": "If you're angry about the new rule that you have to wear bright pink shoes to work every day, why not write up a petition, get all your co-workers to sign it, and submit it to your boss.",
    "long": "Petition comes from the Anglo-Norman word peticiun, meaning \"demand, request,\" and when you petition someone, you ask them to consider your request. If you write up a statement against the town's approval of a new carnival district and collect signatures from 100 neighbors to turn in to the city government, that's a petition. If you pray to the carnival gods to rain down ruin on the carnival, that's also a petition — and no signatures needed."
  },
  "redoubtable": {
    "short": "Redoubtable means honorable, maybe even intimidatingly so. If your grandmother worked tirelessly to raise four kids on her own and started her own taxi cab business and to this day, keeps all of her cabbies in line, she is without a doubt redoubtable.",
    "long": "The adjective redoubtable traces back to the French word redute, meaning “to dread,” a combination of the prefix re-, which adds emphasis, and duter, which mean “to doubt.” But it isn't the redoubtable person that you doubt — it's yourself or your ability to compete against or be compared to him or her. That's where the dread comes in. But you can learn a lot from and be inspired by redoubtable people, if you can just get over being afraid of them."
  },
  "hermetic": {
    "short": "If you want to keep cookies crisp for a long time, store them in a jar with a hermetic, or airtight, seal. Hermetic means sealed so that no air can get in.",
    "long": "The word can be used metaphorically as well. A child who is completely protected from the outside world might be said to come from a hermetic environment. The word comes from the name of the Greek god, Hermes Trismegistus, who was a magician and alchemist and was credited with creating the process for making a completely airtight glass tube, a god-like feat if there ever was one."
  },
  "bovine": {
    "short": "If something is bovine, it has to do with cows or cattle, or it reminds you of the slow and seemingly unintelligent ways of cows and cattle. Someone's glacial pace and dull comments might contribute to his thoroughly bovine impression.",
    "long": "The adjective bovine is used for anything that has to do with animals from the genus “Bos,” which classifies wild and domestic cattle.  Mad Cow Disease is technically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and it can be said to have bovine origins. What are known as cow pies are, in fact, bovine droppings. People can be described as bovine if they are intellectually dull, slow-moving, or somewhat cow-like in their appearance."
  },
  "callow": {
    "short": "If you're a rookie or new to something, you could be described as callow — like callow freshmen in high school or the callow receptionist who can't figure out how to transfer a call.",
    "long": "The word callow comes from the Old English word calu, which meant \"bald or featherless.\" It was used to describe young, fledgling birds. Over time, the meaning expanded to include young, inexperienced people. You'll most often see the adjective paired with the noun youth. Think of the callow youth as people who haven't tested their wings yet."
  },
  "tremulous": {
    "short": "Something tremulous is shaky and quivering, usually from fear or lack of strength. If you're nervous at your first big job interview, your hands might be a little tremulous.",
    "long": "You’ve likely heard the unsteady voice of a person close to tears, or seen the trembling legs of a frightened child — both could certainly be described as tremulous. But you can also use this adjective to describe a statement or action that lacks resolution and courage, or even simply something that's shivering from the cold."
  },
  "defiance": {
    "short": "Stand up when the powers that be order you to sit down, and you've given a fine example of defiance. It happens when someone or a group of someones openly flouts or challenges authority.",
    "long": "Refusing to go to bed when your parents tell you to? That's an act of defiance. Defiance comes from French — specifically to the Old French word defier, which means \"to defy.\" (Don't mix it up with deify; that means to make someone or something into a god.) If you've ever studied Latin, you'll spot the fi in fidare, \"to trust.\""
  },
  "vernacular": {
    "short": "Vernacular describes everyday language, including slang, that's used by the people. The vernacular is different from literary or official language: it's the way people really talk with each other, like how families talk at home.",
    "long": "You know how some language is fancy and formal? Vernacular is different: think of it as how friends talk when no one is listening. Vernacular language includes slang and obscenities. One of the hardest things about writing for school is getting away from the vernacular and learning to write in more formal ways that don't come as naturally. You can also say specific groups have a vernacular, meaning the unique way people in a certain region or profession speak."
  },
  "cogitate": {
    "short": "To cogitate is a fancy way of saying to think hard about. If you spend a lot of time figuring out exactly how your French teacher does her hair, you are cogitating in order to avoid conjugating.",
    "long": "Cogitate can be used both transitively or intransitively, which means you can cogitate on something, like your history project or why your computer never seems to work the way you want it to. Or you can simply sit in your room and cogitate."
  },
  "expatriate": {
    "short": "An expatriate is someone who lives in another country by choice. If you leave your split-level ranch in Ohio and move to a writers' commune in Paris for good, you've become an expatriate.",
    "long": "Expatriate can also be a verb, so that American in Paris has expatriated. There was a scene of expatriates, or expats, living in Paris in the roaring '20s that included writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. The word used to mean to get kicked out of your native country — it's from the French word expatrier which means \"banish.\" The prefix ex means \"out of\" and  the Latin patria \"one's native country,\" but the word took a turn and now refers to people who left without getting shoved out."
  },
  "contemplative": {
    "short": "The contemplative life is one filled with deep and serious thought, and is often associated with monks, nuns, philosophers, and theorists.",
    "long": "The adjective contemplative means \"pensive,\" \"meditative,\" or \"brooding.\" Contemplative moments, of course, aren't restricted to white-bearded hermits living in caves on mountaintops. You might also hear the word when people are talking about yoga or meditation, as these are quiet activities meant to be thoughtfully performed. Some kinds of poetry and music are described as contemplative, especially if they give you space to daydream or think about their themes. A walk through nature can also be a contemplative activity."
  },
  "misnomer": {
    "short": "A misnomer is a wrong or unsuitable name. It’s a misnomer to call your grandmother “Grandfather,” the same way it’s a misnomer to call a chair with four legs that doesn’t move unless you drag it across the floor, a rocking chair.",
    "long": "From the Middle-French misnomer “to misname” evolved our English misnomer, a noun indicating a lack of fit when it comes to naming. Synonyms include, predictably, misnamed, but also mistermed and miscalled. You’ll notice the repetition of the mis- at the front of all those words. It comes from the French mes-, which means “wrongly.”"
  },
  "malediction": {
    "short": "“Darn you!” “Go bury your head in the sand.” “You ugly nincompoop!” Each of those nasty curses is a malediction (and, I’m sure, nothing you would ever say to another human being).",
    "long": "A malediction is a curse. Not like the kind a witch puts on someone, but close. More like what the schoolyard bully says to hurt someone’s feelings. On purpose. Malediction has male in it, but it’s not a slur against men or boys. Mal comes from the Latin for \"evil\" and \"diction,\" and as you may remember, has to do with what we say. So a malediction is an evil statement directed at someone else. Pretty nasty, if you ask me."
  },
  "convince": {
    "short": "\"How again was it that you convinced me to do this?\" the boy said to his friend before they jumped out of the plane on their first sky dive. Convince means to talk someone into something, or win someone over.",
    "long": "A person convinces by making an argument—you can convince your parents to let you go to the movies by promising you'll do all your homework the next day. A thing can convince as well. The cash prize convinced me to enter the contest. The threat of failure convinced the kids to study."

  "masticate": {
    "short": "To masticate is to chew your food or to bite and grind stuff with your teeth.",
    "long": "While humans use their teeth, primarily molars, to masticate their food, some animals have evolved other ways to do this. Some masticate by crushing food between hard plates on the top and bottom of their mouths, and others masticate by using a spiny tongue to break down their food."
  },
  "demean": {
    "short": "To demean someone is to insult them. To demean is to degrade or put down a person or thing.",
    "long": "If you noticed the word mean in demean, that's a good clue to its meaning. To demean someone is very mean. You are demeaning your sister or brother if you run their underwear up a flagpole. A teacher could demean a student by saying \"You're stupid!\" To demean is to insult: no one wants to be demeaned. Insulting language is often called demeaning. We can also say a bad president demeaned his office."
  },
  "lurid": {
    "short": "Something lurid is vivid and attention-grabbing in a shocking, graphic, or horrible way. that pulls them in. Your mother might complain that she hates lurid TV shows — ones that are overly sensationalized and meant to shock.",
    "long": "An expression used to avoid hearing or seeing disturbing things is \"spare me the lurid details,\" and people say that so they won't have shocking or ugly images put into their imaginations. The word lurid, which entered English in the 17th century, comes from Latin lūridis, \"ghastly, pale yellow,\" and it can also refer to things that are a ghastly yellow color or to something shining with a strange red glow. All of the synonyms for the adjective lurid describe qualities that can turn a person pale: dreadful, nightmarish, and horrific, among others."
  },
  "heterogeneous": {
    "short": "Heterogeneous can be used to describe the diversity of nearly anything — populations, classrooms, collections. A heterogeneous array of immigrants passed through Ellis Island to help create the American \"melting pot.\"",
    "long": "An easy way to remember the meaning of this word is that homo is the same and hetero is different. So, a homogeneous group of puppies might consist of apricot-colored poodles, while a heterogeneous group might consist of a hodgepodge of different pups ranging from dachshunds to dalmatians. Anytime you are confronted with a group whose members are not all similar to one another, you have an opportunity to trot out heterogeneous."
  },
  "fraudulent": {
    "short": "Something fraudulent is intentionally false and meant to harm or deceive. That email message from the Sultan of Brunei offering you millions of dollars just might be fraudulent.",
    "long": "From the fact that the word fraudulent is frequently teamed with the word scheme, you can get the idea that something fraudulent is sneaky, snarky, and just plain wrong. A fraudulent scheme is one designed to gain something at the expense of someone else. It might be small — trying to use an expired coupon — or bigger — lying on your taxes. Whatever its form, planning something fraudulent is cheating, and it's wrong."
  },
  "humdrum": {
    "short": "Something humdrum is dull, tedious, and totally boring. If a regular old photography class sounds too humdrum, you might instead sign up for Underwater Photography of Marine Predators. Don't forget your wetsuit!",
    "long": "Anything that you can call humdrum is so severely lacking in variety and excitement that it's sure to make you hum and drum your fingers out of boredom. Humdrum is an adjective to describe the unglamorous monotony of everyday routines. It's the same old thing, again and again, over and over. Humdrum can also mean predictable, mind-numbing and not very challenging — hopefully the complete opposite of your social life."
  },
  "idiom": {
    "short": "An idiom is a form of expression that is particular to a certain person or group of people. If your friend always says, \"squirrelly nuteriffic!\" when she means something is great, she's using her own idiom.",
    "long": "Idiom comes from the Greek idios, which means personal. Idiom originally meant \"speech peculiar or proper to a people or country.\" These days we use idiom for a specialized vocabulary or an expression that isn't obvious, like kick the bucket which means \"die.\" If you're studying a foreign language, idioms are the hardest phrases to translate."
  },
  "pesticide": {
    "short": "A pesticide is a bug-killing poison. You may have to resort to using a pesticide to battle the ants that have invaded your kitchen, even if you hate killing any creature.",
    "long": "Pesticides are most often used to ward off insects or small animals living uninvited in a person's house, or in a garden or on a farm, when they are nibbling on plants or flowers. The Latin suffix cide means \"killer,\" and in pesticide, it's combined with the English word pest, which means just what it sounds like — a troublesome annoyance."
  },
  "optimistic": {
    "short": "An optimistic person thinks the best possible thing will happen, and hopes for it even if it's not likely. Someone who's a tad too confident this way is also sometimes called optimistic.",
    "long": "If you see the glass as half-full when others see it as half-empty; if you look on the bright side of things, you're optimistic. If the chain falls off your rusty old bicycle, a tire goes flat, the frame cracks down the middle, the seat keeps twisting around, and you say, \"But look! The little bell still works — I'm sure this bike will be fine,\" you're being very optimistic, though some might venture to call you \"delusional.\""
  },
  "despotic": {
    "short": "A ruler who governs with an iron fist, caring little for the welfare of the people, can be called despotic.  Dictators and tyrants are often described as despotic.",
    "long": "Despotic is the adjective form of the noun despot, which means \"tyrannical ruler.\" If you live under despotic rule, you probably have few rights and may fear your government.  Use despotic to describe rulers that rely on brute force (or the threat of it) rather than the rule of law to keep order.  Even if you're not the emperor of your own small kingdom, you might be a despotic boss, intimidating your employees. Might you consider switching to benevolence instead?"
  },
  "confrontation": {
    "short": "A confrontation is an angry disagreement. You might become so irritated about your upstairs neighbor's loud, awful music that a confrontation is unavoidable.",
    "long": "Confrontation implies hostility, although like a fight, a confrontation can involve actual violence, or just a clash of words. A confrontation often refers to a military encounter involving opposing armies. This meaning became popular after the Cuban missile crisis in 1963. Before that, confrontation was used to mean \"bringing two opposing parties face to face,\" from the Latin word confrontationem."

    "short": "When you express your right to something, you're making a claim to it, like telling your sister, \"This bowl of cereal is mine.\"",
    "long": "A claim is when you express your right to something that belongs to you, like your medical records or the deed to your home. When you make a claim or claim something, you're demanding it or saying it’s true. People claim dependents and deductions on their taxes. In court, you could claim you deserve money from an employer who cheated you. You could claim you can juggle chainsaws. With any kind of claim, you're going to have to prove it."
  },
  "prickly": {
    "short": "Prickly things are sharp and spiky, while prickly people are quick to be offended or irritated. Ouch!",
    "long": "A prickly tag in the collar of your new shirt can make you uncomfortable all day, and so can a prickly co-worker whose feelings seem to get hurt by everything you say. Porcupines and cactuses are prickly, and so is the next-door neighbor who is constantly irritated with you. The first thing that was described as prickly, in the 1570s, was a holly leaf."
  },
  "spine": {
    "short": "Your spine is your backbone. When you sit and stand with your spine straight, people will compliment you on your good posture.",
    "long": "Besides being the basic part of a vertebrate's skeleton, a spine is also a sharp spike, like the spines on a sea urchin or a cactus. Another kind of spine is the \"backbone\" of a book, the part of its cover that you can read when the book is on a bookshelf. Spine comes from the Latin spina, which also means both \"backbone\" and \"thorn.\""
  },
  "frenetic": {
    "short": "The adjective frenetic is another way to say frenzied, frantic, or totally worked up. Kind of how you'd run around the kitchen madly trying to cook a last-minute dinner for 30 of your closest friends.",
    "long": "Sometimes tinged with fear and often quite maniacal, frenetic comes from the Latin phreneticus, meaning “delirious.” The Latin word, in turn, came from a similarly spelled Greek word which, when translated literally, means “inflammation of the brain.” So it's no surprise that a frenetic person looks absolutely crazed and super anxious."
  },
  "satirical": {
    "short": "If you know the movie you are about to see is satirical, you expect it to make fun some aspect of human nature or even our society, like a satirical take on the glamorous world of fashion that portrays all the designers as celebrity-obsessed and unconcerned with true artistry.",
    "long": "Satirical is an adjective that describes satire, a work that is intended to ridicule the shortcomings and antics of a person or group. So, something that is satirical often looks like the real thing in order to make fun of it. For example, a sketch on a comedy show in which a comedian sits behind a news anchor desk and uses a serious tone to \"report\" on absurd events that really happened takes a satirical approach to both the events and the concept of broadcast journalism."

  "hedonism": {
    "short": "Strictly speaking, hedonism is the belief that pursuing pleasure leads to the greatest ethical good. In practice, though, the ethical part sometimes gets lost in the pleasure part.",
    "long": "Hedonism originally hails from the Greek word hedone, meaning \"pleasure.\" In Ancient Greece, hedonism really did have an ethical component, and its adherents really believed that society would be best served if you as an individual cultivated those things that gave you the greatest pleasure, instead of the self-denial inherent in other philosophies and religions. Over time the philosophical aspect of hedonism has faded and we are left an idea that looks to us very much like, well, Las Vegas."
  },
  "cerebral": {
    "short": "If you are a cerebral person, no one would ever call you a drama queen. You make decisions using your intelligence and cold, hard facts, instead of your emotions.",
    "long": "The word cerebral gets its meaning from cerebrum, which is Latin for \"brain.\" Cerebral people use their brains instead of their hearts. The cerebrum is a particular section of the brain, and anything related to that part is also cerebral, like in medicine. A cerebral hemorrhage, for example, means a hemorrhage has occurred in the brain — a phrase you'd never want to hear coming from a doctor."
  },
  "tractable": {
    "short": "If your little brother quietly obeys your instructions and waits for you at the food court while you and your friends wander around the mall, he's probably a tractable child, meaning he's obedient, flexible, and responds well to directions.",
    "long": "Note the similarity between tractable and tractor.  Both come from the Latin word tractare, which originally meant \"to drag about.\"  You can think of a tractable person as someone who can be dragged about easily, like a plow being dragged by a tractor."
  },
  "leviathan": {
    "short": "A leviathan is a giant sea creature. It can be real, like a whale, or mythical.",
    "long": "Moby Dick is an example of a famous leviathan. The word comes from Hebrew livyathan which means a great sea serpent or sea monster. A real leviathan is the giant sea squid Architeuthis, which was photographed alive for the first time in 2005. A leviathan can also be something that is really, really big. The Titanic was a leviathan that now rests with leviathans."

  "rudimentary": {
    "short": "Rudimentary means basic, or at a very early stage. The test should be easy: it requires only a rudimentary understanding of the materials.",
    "long": "The word rude means simple or offensive — and people with only rudimentary understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is rude. If you remember that the word rude is the foundation of rudimentary, you'll have a rudimentary understanding of the word."
  },
  "conviction": {
    "short": "A conviction is something certain: a judgment of guilty in court and a strong belief are both convictions.",
    "long": "In the legal world, when a judge or jury convicts someone of a crime — finding them guilty — this is called a conviction. Prosecutors try to get convictions, and defense attorneys try to prevent them. Also, convictions are beliefs — principles. The United States was founded on many convictions, such as the belief in free speech and separation of church and state. When you have a conviction, you're certain of something."
  },
  "elegy": {
    "short": "An elegy is a sad poem, usually written to praise and express sorrow for someone who is dead. Although a speech at a funeral is a eulogy, you might later compose an elegy to someone you have loved and lost to the grave.",
    "long": "The purpose of this kind of poem is to express feelings rather than tell a story. Thomas Gray's “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” is a poem that reflects on the lives of common people buried in a church cemetery, and on the nature of human mortality. The noun elegy was borrowed in the 16th century from Middle French élégie, from Latin elegīa, from Greek elegeia, from elegos \"mournful poem or song.\""

  },
  "transcendent": {
    "short": "Transcendent describes something so excellent that it's beyond the range of human understanding.",
    "long": "Transcendent shares the prefix trans, meaning \"across,\" with many familiar words such as transport (\"carry across\"), transcontinental (\r\nacross a continent\"), and transparent (\"allowing light to shine across\"). Transcendental meditation carries people across to a higher consciousness. So something transcendent goes across boring reality into super awesomeness in a world all its own. It moves you. Angels are transcendent, and even your favorite novel can be transcendent."
  },
  "induce": {
    "short": "To induce is to move or lead someone to action. A promise of a lollipop can induce a toddler to do just about anything, even sit down and be polite to Aunt Edna. Older kids need something more substantial.",
    "long": "Some people believe that if you offer someone a large enough sum of money, you could induce them to do almost anything. But a movie heroine might say to the villain, \"Nothing could induce me to marry you. Not all the money in the world. Not if you were the last man on Earth!\" Induce also means to stimulate the occurrence of something, such as medications used to induce vomiting, or to induce a pregnant woman to go into labor."
  },
  "derivative": {
    "short": "Alert: shifting parts of speech! As a noun, a derivative is kind of financial agreement or deal. As an adjective, though, derivative describes something that borrows heavily from something else that came before it.",
    "long": "The economic meltdown of the last decade is due largely to the mismanagement of derivatives, which are deals based on the outcome of other deals. A movie plot might be described as derivative if it steals from another film — say, if it lifts the tornado, the witch, and the dancing scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz."
  },
  "notice": {
    "short": "The word notice has to do with paying attention to something. For example, you usually notice a flashing light, and an overdue bill might come with the word \"NOTICE\" written on it to make sure you see it.",
    "long": "The Latin nōtitia, a noun meaning \"something known,\" was the ancestor of notice.  Use the verb to mean “to see or point out\" and the noun to mean \"formal warning.\"  When you give “advance notice,” you let someone know early or ahead of time.  In case you haven't noticed, the notice posted on your door says you've been promoted and should move to the corner office.  No doubt because of your attention to detail."
  },
  "subordinate": {
    "short": "A subordinate is someone who works for someone else. As a verb, to subordinate means to place or rank one thing below another. When you're doing a group project, sometimes you have to subordinate your ideas to the desires of the larger group.",
    "long": "The prefix sub- means \"lower\" and ordinate refers to an ordering of things. In the army, a private is subordinate to an officer. You can also say the private is a subordinate. When it's an adjective or noun, the word is pronounced \"suh-BOR-duh-nit.\" When it's a verb, it’s pronounced \"suh-BOR-duh-nate.\" Don’t subordinate one pronunciation to the other: they're both equally important."
  },
  "fraught": {
    "short": "Fraught means filled with something — often something bad. Your Thanksgiving was fraught with awkward moments when your family saw your blue hair, and it only got worse when you told them you'd quit law school to join the circus.",
    "long": "Fraught is related to the word freight, and comes from the Middle English fraughten, meaning \"to load with cargo.\" Think of a cargo ship loaded up with freight for a journey — it's full of supplies, just like Thanksgiving was filled with — or fraught with — awkward moments. Fraught can also describe a situation filled with distress. If relations between two countries are fraught, they are not getting along with each other."
  },
  "weary": {
    "short": "Weary as an adjective means \"very tired or worn out,\" like weary students who finished a long week of studying and taking tests.",
    "long": "Weary comes from the Old English word werig, meaning \"tired.\" It can also describe being extremely bored and sick of something, like on a long drive, you might grow weary of your father's singing voice. As a  verb, weary means \"to exhaust or wear out,\" like when the children you are babysitting weary you with their game of running away every time you tell them to get ready to leave the park."
  },
  "imperturbable": {
    "short": "If you're imperturbable you are not easily upset. If your goal is to be imperturbable, then you can't let things bother you or get you stressed, confused, or angry.",
    "long": "The adjective imperturbable is the flip side of perturbable, which comes from perturb, which in turn traces back to the Latin word perturbare, meaning “to confuse” or “to disturb.” If something really annoying is going on, like one neighbor is jack-hammering his driveway and another has a dog that's barking while you're trying to sleep because you were up all night studying and you really really need a nap, but you stay calm and don’t get upset, you are imperturbable."
  },
  "strain": {
    "short": "The noun strain is a stretch, effort, or exertion. You can strain your ankle, or your little brother can strain your patience.",
    "long": "This word has many, many meanings. Athletes strain their knees, which strains the emotions of their fans. Usually, you have to strain a little to accomplish anything, like getting an A in math. A strain may also be a line, like a line of ancestry, of thought, or a melodic line in music. Maybe you have to strain to hear the quiet flute in an orchestra. Another meaning is to pass something through a filter, like tea leaves."
  },
  "nebulous": {
    "short": "Something that's nebulous is clouded or hazy. When you walk through the woods on a foggy morning, the trees may all have a mysterious, nebulous look to them.",
    "long": "When you fly in a plane on an overcast day, the land below you looks nebulous and indistinct. You can also use nebulous in a more figurative way, to describe vague ideas or fuzzy concepts. Nebulous comes from the Latin nebulosus, \"cloudy, misty, or foggy.\" Its root is nebula, which is \"vapor or fog\" in Latin and was adopted by astronomers in the 1700s to mean \"a cloud of gas and dust in outer space.\""
  },
  "prescience": {
    "short": "Do you already know what happens tomorrow? Next week? Next year? If you can see into the future, then you have prescience.",
    "long": "The word prescience might look like pre + science, but it really comes from the Latin word praescientia, which means \"fore-knowledge\" — or knowledge you know before anyone else. Don't assume it's a crystal ball kind of power that lets someone with prescience see the future. It's more like a state of mind or level of expertise that allows for excellent foresight and planning."
  },
  "caricature": {
    "short": "A caricature is a satirical, exaggerated portrayal of a person. You'd better not caricature your father by walking bent-over and speaking in his high voice. If he catches you, you'll be in trouble!",
    "long": "An exaggeration of a person's character results in a caricature. While this might help you to remember its meaning, don't let the spelling confuse you. Character has an \"h\" but caricature does not. If you're so excited about something that you feel a little out of control, you might seem like a caricature of yourself to your friends. You can use this word as a verb too. Presidents and other prominent politicians are often caricatured in political cartoons."

  "salutary": {
    "short": "Use salutary to describe something that's good for your health, like the salutary benefits of exercise, laughter, and getting enough sleep every night.",
    "long": "When you look at the word salutary, you might expect it to have something to do with showing respect to military personnel, perhaps by saluting. In fact, salutary and salute do share a Latin root: salus, which means \"good health.\" When you salute someone, or say \"Salud!\" before clinking glasses and taking a first sip, you're essentially giving your salutary wish — in other words, hoping a person enjoys good health."
  },
  "remiss": {
    "short": "If it's your turn to bring in the coffee and donuts for your early morning meeting, and you forget, then your co-workers can say that you were remiss in fulfilling your responsibility to keep them awake with sugar and caffeine. Don't expect to get much done at your meeting.",
    "long": "The adjective remiss is often used in the phrase \"remiss in one's duty.\" The principal was remiss in her duty to tell parents about the incident at school.

The adjective malleable dates back to Middle English, from Old French, from Medieval Latin malleābilis, from malleāre, \"to hammer.\""
  },
  "startle": {
    "short": "To startle is to jump, like when you're surprised. If you’re sneaking through a dark room and step on a sleeping dog’s tail — you might startle  the dog. If she barks, that dog startles you right back!",
    "long": "A startle is a quick, sharp movement, like a little jump that happens when you’re surprised or suddenly scared. If you sneak up on your mom and say \"Boo!\" you’ll startle her and she might jump up in her seat (before she yells at you to quit it). Alarm clocks and barking dogs often startle people. The original meaning of startle, around 1300, was \"to run back and forth,\" from the Old English word styrtan, \"to leap up.\""

  "state": {
    "short": "State can be a condition — like solid, liquid, or gas, or even sad or happy. It can also be a state as in Idaho or New York. To state is to say something.",
    "long": "State comes from the Latin status, meaning \"condition of a country.\" Interestingly, even before the Revolutionary War, Britain called the American colonies states. The “States” still refers to America, but state can refer to any country’s civil government. The idea of state as a physical or emotional condition came later. Depending on your state of mind, you can state that the state of your state is awesome. Unless it’s in a state of emergency, which is no good."
  },
  "bilious": {
    "short": "If an unpleasant meal has left you feeling grumpy and looking green, you're bilious in several senses of the word. This adjective can mean both \"troubled by indigestion\" and \"irritable,\" and it can also be used to suggest a sickly green shade.",
    "long": "The wonderfully descriptive word bilious comes from the root bile, which is a foul green fluid made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder — a fact that helps us picture something described as bilious as being really foul. Because of the connection with bile, we often refer to something that's an ugly shade of green as being bilious. Of course, the word can also be more kindly applied to someone who has a liver or gall bladder disorder."
  },
  "eccentric": {
    "short": "You're most likely to encounter the adjective eccentric in a description of an unusual or quirky person — like a scatterbrained aunt who leaves her life savings to her cat.",
    "long": "From the Greek ekkentros, \"out of the center,\" this word originally had to do with the orbits of planets that were observed to be slightly out of whack. Eventually it came to describe people who were a little kooky, both as an adjective and as a noun, too: an eccentric is an unconventional, odd person. Think of them as following a slightly different orbit from the rest of society."

  "priority": {
    "short": "When a group or a person cares about one thing over all others, that’s the top priority. “After the flood, finding a place to live became their first priority.”",

    "long": "Use the noun altruism to refer to feelings or actions that show an unselfish concern for other people. In science, altruism refers to animal behavior that could be harmful to the animal itself but that contributes to the survival of the animal group. It's related to the adjective altruistic.

  },
  "disintegrate": {
    "short": "Soak your tooth in a cup of soda for long enough and it will disintegrate, or break apart from decay.",
    "long": "The word disintegrate comes from a combination of the prefix dis- meaning \"do the opposite of\" and the Latin integrare meaning \"to make whole.\" When something disintegrates, it does the opposite of become whole; it falls apart. Objects can either disintegrate over time — like a tooth soaking in a cup of soda, or instantaneously — like a building disintegrating into dust from an explosion."
  },
  "bane": {
    "short": "The noun bane refers to anything that is a cause of harm, ruin, or death. But we often use it for things that aren't that bad, just feel like it. You might say mosquitoes are the bane of your existence.",
    "long": "The source of this word is Middle and Old English bana, meaning \"destroyer, murderer.\" The now obsolete meaning of \"deadly poison\" is seen in the names of poisonous plants such as wolfsbane and henbane. Although \"bane of my existence\" is a commonly heard phrase, there's something deliciously archaic about the word bane. It conjures up villages preyed upon by dragons, or witches adding one bane or another to a steaming kettle."
  },
  "wane": {
    "short": "Things that wane simply grow smaller. \"My initial enthusiasm for helping waned when I saw the massive pile of envelopes that needed sealing.\"",
    "long": "Things that wax and wane, like the moon, grow larger and smaller. Wax is the opposite of wane. A fad, or a fashion, or even a disease, that is on its way out the door is \"on the wane.\" If your influence over your little brother wanes, he’ll probably stop copying you. Anything that wanes, like the moon, influence, or a feeling, has started to go away."
  },
  "stratification": {
    "short": "Stratification means arranging something, or something that has been arranged, into categories. By the time you figure out the complex social stratification of your high school class, from jocks to nerds and everything between, you’re ready to graduate.",
    "long": "Stratification is a system or formation of layers, classes, or categories. Stratification is used to describe a particular way of arranging seeds while planting, as well as the geological layers of rocks. But like so many science words, somehow it’s not content to stay in the scientific realm, and must also have a place in the social sphere, where its job is to categorize and arrange people into groups: upper, middle, and lower classes, for example."
  },
  "bevy": {
    "short": "A bevy is a flock of birds. Although the term can be used for a variety of birds, it most often refers specifically to a bevy of quail. Other terms exist to describe flocks of other types of birds — a murder of crows, for example.",
    "long": "A bevy can also describe a large gathering of people, usually of the same type (a bevy of schoolchildren; a bevy of tourists). Most often, however, bevy is used to refer to a gathering of women. At a family reunion, you may find your grandmother holding court in the kitchen with a bevy of female relations. Young, attractive women are sometimes referred to, somewhat poetically, as \"a bevy of beauties.\""

  "epigram": {
    "short": "An epigram is a short, clever remark. One of Oscar Wilde's many memorable epigrams is \"I can resist everything but temptation.\"",
    "long": "Epigram comes from the Latin word epigramma, which means \"an inscription.\" If you've ever seen an inscription on, say, the back of a watch, you know the writing has to be brief. It won't surprise you, then, that epigrams are very short poems, sayings, or famous quotations, like Benjamin Franklin's \"Little strokes fell great oaks,\" a memorable reminder to keep working toward big goals or to pay attention to little details, the opposite of an epigram from our era: \"Don't sweat the small stuff.\""

  "prophylactic": {
    "short": "Prophylactic might sound like a prehistoric period when dinosaurs roamed the earth, but it actually describes something that can prevent something negative, such as disease. Prophylactic surgery to remove a mole can prevent skin cancer.",
    "long": "If you want to avoid getting sick, you can get a vaccine, take medicine, or have surgery — all of which are considered prophylactic measures. Delve deeper into the history of this four-syllable word and you'll find the Greek term prophulaktikos, which means to \"guard before.\" Prophylactic can also describe a contraceptive used to prevent pregnancy. This use of the word started because condoms, which are prophylactics, were originally designed to prevent disease, not pregnancy."

  "oration": {
    "short": "An oration is a formal speech given in public. You might give the oration at the big party celebrating your grandparents’ 50th anniversary.",
    "long": "If you’re giving an oration, make sure you show up prepared. An oration is a speech that’s planned in advance rather than made up on the spot. It usually has a formal tone and is presented at a ceremony of some kind. You probably remember nervously sitting through an oration at your graduation ceremony, or you may have listened to a funeral oration celebrating the life of a famous person."
  },
  "contrary": {
    "short": "Use contrary when two things are exactly opposite or entirely different. If something is contrary to something else, it is opposed to or against it.",
    "long": "A contrary child is one who opposes people in authority. As a noun, the contrary means the opposite, as in \"We will not give up; on the contrary, we will fight with all our power.\" The adjective contrary derives from Latin contrarius (\"opposite, opposed\") from contra (\"against\")."
  },
  "sojourn": {
    "short": "A sojourn is a short stay or visit. If you want a fancy way to say that you took a trip to the countryside, you might talk about your country sojourn.",
    "long": "The verb is originally from the Latin prefix sub- \"under\" plus diurnus \"of a day.\" You might refer to your vacation as a sojourn, but it might make more sense if you are describing a trip to Provence rather than a trip to Disney World. Or In figurative use, sojourn means to delve––your math teacher may stop midway through lessons on fractions for a brief sojourn into techniques for slicing pie."
  },
  "apropos": {
    "short": "Apropos means regarding or appropriate to, as in: Apropos of your interest in fishing, your grandfather gave you his set of championship lures, rods, reels and lucky tackle box.",
    "long": "Apropos is a useful word to learn. But first you have to know how to pronounce it: AP-rə-pō. Then you can conveniently change the subject of a conversation by using the expression \"Apropos of nothing,\" which is a glib way of saying, \"Oh, and by the way...\" If someone's remarks are suitable and appropriate to the occasion, you can get on their good side by saying: How apropos!"
  },
  "sonorous": {
    "short": "Used to describe sound or speech that is full, rich, and deep, sonorous is a great word for snoring, for bass voices, and for low notes on the tuba.",
    "long": "Skip the first \"o\" and you'll see snore inside this word, which should give you a clue as to its deeply resonant character. Another way to remember sonorous is that son sounds like \"sound,\" and that's what this word is all about."
  },
  "revenue": {
    "short": "Revenue is money earned by a business, or income received by the government from taxes. The government is always interested in dreaming up new sources of revenue, and so is the average head of a company unless she doesn't want to be the head anymore.",
    "long": "Revenue is from a French word meaning \"to return or come back,\" and dollar returns are always a welcome thing. Declining advertising revenue will doom your website, no matter how great it is. If your lemonade stand is not making a profit, you might consider lowering costs. Maybe you could get cheaper lemonade mix? Or you might look for more creative and exciting ways to increase revenue––like raiding the pantry for cookies you can sell as well."
  },
  "tantamount": {
    "short": "When something is tantamount to another thing it is essentially its equivalent. For some animal activists, wearing fur is tantamount to murder.",
    "long": "Tantamount often refers to an action or thing being compared to another greater action or quality, as in, “Missing your finals is tantamount to dropping out of college.” While the two sides are essentially equal, you would not say, \"Dropping out of school is tantamount to missing your finals.” A related word is paramount, which means “the highest” or “primary.”"
  },
  "oligarchy": {
    "short": "Does it ever feel like just a few people have all the power? If it's a government that's run like this, it's an oligarchy. A country that has this form of government is an oligarchy too.",
    "long": "The political term, oligarchy, comes to English from the Greek with its meaning intact — a form of government run by a small number of people such as wealthy landowners, royalty or powerful military figures. If you say that you can't fight the oligarchy, you mean the leaders of such a place. Sometimes the word refers to the few powerful people in charge of a large company or system. A financial oligarchy might try to block reform."
  },
  "peevish": {
    "short": "When you're peevish, you're easily irritated and grumpy. Everything seems to get under your skin.",
    "long": "Know someone who always seems annoyed, grumpy, cranky, or irritated? That person is peevish. Some people are peevish in general, but most people can be peevish about certain subjects — we all have a pet peeve. Lots of people get peevish about language: like using the word like all the time as verbal filler. Being peevish is almost always considered a form of pettiness — it's not a good thing. When you're peevish, you're not really looking at the big picture."
  },
  "implausible": {
    "short": "Something that's implausible is farfetched or unlikely. If it's 3 pm and you still have to study for three exams and write an essay before midnight, it’s implausible that you’ll also have time to watch a movie.",
    "long": "The adjective implausible breaks down into im, meaning “not,” and plausible, meaning \"likely.\" So it simply means \"not likely.\" Implausible ideas or stories usually get high marks for creativity, but they're just too crazy to be believable. But as philosopher René Descartes noted, “One cannot conceive anything so strange and so implausible that it has not already been said by one philosopher or another.”"
  },
  "susceptible": {
    "short": "If you are susceptible to something such as infections or earaches, it means you are likely to become sick with these things.",
    "long": "Have you ever received something you don't want? Well, with susceptible meaning \"likely to be influenced or affected by\" that is probably going to be the case. If you're susceptible to flattery, and someone wants something from you, all they have to do is give you a compliment or two and you'll do what they want. Material that's susceptible to cracking won't be in good condition for long."
  },
  "unconscionable": {
    "short": "Something that is almost unimaginably unacceptable is unconscionable. Think of it as being something that no reasonable person would even think of doing or saying — something unbelievable, outrageous, and often horrible.",
    "long": "The word unconscionable is related to the word conscience. Add the un-, and you can see that it refers to something done without applying good moral judgment. The word first appeared in the mid-16th century — presumably everyone up until that time had high scruples and never did or said anything beyond the boundaries of conscience. Sadly, the antonym, conscionable, is rarely used, and, in fact, has been obsolete since the 18th century, though unconscionable remains in frequent use."
  },
  "discrepancy": {
    "short": "A discrepancy is a lack of agreement or balance. If there is a discrepancy between the money you earned and the number on your paycheck, you should complain to your boss.",
    "long": "There is a discrepancy when there is a difference between two things that should be alike. For example, there can be a wide discrepancy or a slight discrepancy between two objects, stories, or facts. The noun discrepancy is from Latin discrepare \"to sound differently,\" from the prefix dis- \"from\" plus crepare \"to rattle, creak.\""
  },
  "occupation": {
    "short": "An occupation is a physical takeover. Your student group's occupation of the college building made news when your demands became known. In exchange for leaving, you wanted the college to grant a tuition freeze.",
    "long": "The occupation of a building can refer to the rightful habitation by its residents or the takeover of a building, as in a protest. The occupation of a country, however, always refers to the takeover and control of one country by another, as in the German occupation of France during WWII. The noun occupation can also mean your line of work or anything that occupies your time. Some people have unusual occupations, such as alligator wrangler or golf ball retriever."
  },
  "fidget": {
    "short": "To fidget is to make little movements with your hands and feet. Even if you're nervous during your job interview, try not to fidget.",
    "long": "The word fidget is related to the Old Norse fikja, meaning \"move briskly, be restless or eager.\" If you are feeling impatient or anxious you might fidget in your seat or fidget with a pen in your hands. A person who fidgets a lot can be referred to as a fidget and so can that quick anxious movement itself."
  },
  "antipathy": {
    "short": "An antipathy is a deep-seated dislike of something or someone. Usually it's a condition that is long-term, innate, and pretty unlikely to change — like your antipathy for the Red Sox.",
    "long": "If you look at the Greek roots of this word — anti- (\"against\") and pathos (\"feeling\") — you can see that antipathy is a feeling against someone or something. In general, antipathies are feelings that are kept at least somewhat under wraps and are not out in the open."
  },
  "heckle": {
    "short": "To heckle is to challenge or harass someone. At a sporting event, fans sometimes heckle the opposing team, but it’s not very respectable behavior.",
    "long": "One of the many challenges of being a stand-up comedian is dealing with people harassing you from the audience. Those people are heckling. While heckling in a comedy club is not all that unusual, it’s still rude. If you choose to heckle someone, whether they are a comic or anyone else, be prepared to be heckled back — or worse."
  },
  "bowdlerize": {
    "short": "To bowdlerize means to edit offensive parts out of something. If the hero in an R-rated movie adapted for TV  exclaims, “Oh shoot fudge darn!” but his lips seem to be saying something else, that movie has been bowdlerized.",
    "long": "The word bowdlerized comes from the name of Dr. T. Bowdler, who decided to publish an edition of Shakespeare without sexual references or double-entendres (which is when a word has two meanings, one of them cheeky). Mr. Bowdler thought he was performing a great service for humanity, but generally if we call something bowdlerized, we’re implying that it was edited in a prudish way."
  },
  "model": {
    "short": "To model something is to show it off. To make a model of your favorite car is to create a miniature version of it. To be a model is to be so gorgeous that you’re photographed for a living.",
    "long": "The word model, which can be a noun, verb, or adjective, comes from the Latin word modulus, meaning “measure,” or “standard.” If you are a model student, you do everything as the school and teachers wish: you are the standard. If you model your life on your hero's, you try to do what he or she does. If you are a clothing designer you will need to hire a model to model your creations."
  },
  "discern": {
    "short": "If you can make out, pick out, or distinguish something, you can discern it. This is a word for recognizing and perceiving things.",
    "long": "Discerning has to do with being able to see or hear something. In a loud room, it can be hard to discern one person's voice. If there's not much light, you'll have trouble discerning the words on a page well enough to read. If you have sloppy handwriting, then it's hard to discern what you wrote. When you can discern something, you can tell what it is; you can identify it."
  },
  "predicament": {
    "short": "If you're engaged to get married but suddenly fall in love with someone else, you have gotten yourself into quite a predicament. A predicament is a difficult, confusing, and unpleasant situation.",
    "long": "The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means \"a state of being.\" Which makes sense considering the words that sound like predicate are all about states of being––predict, or say what's going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a sentence that's led by the verb. Think of predicament as an unpleasant state of being."
  },
  "prodigy": {
    "short": "A prodigy is someone who is so naturally talented at something that they become a master of that particular skill as a child — you can be a musical prodigy or a math prodigy. Mozart was one, writing symphonies and playing for kings when he was only five years old.",
    "long": "Prodigy is one of those wonderful words whose different meanings tell a story about how the meanings of words bloom over time. The word derives from the Latin prodigium, meaning \"an omen or a sign of something to come.\" Prodigies are kids who often seem so talented that their success must presage even greater mastery, though, of course, the irony is that most prodigies peak in their youth."
  },
  "peripatetic": {
    "short": "If you're reading this on a treadmill or while taking a walk, you may know about the peripatetic, or walking, philosopher Aristotle, who taught while strolling with his students. Or, maybe you just like being a peripatetic, a walking wanderer.",
    "long": "Peri- is the Greek word for \"around,\" and peripatetic is an adjective that describes someone who likes to walk or travel around. Peripatetic is also a noun for a person who travels from one place to another or moves around a lot. If you walk in a circle, you are peripatetic, or walking, but you aren’t a peripatetic, or wanderer, unless you actually go somewhere."
  },
  "outmoded": {
    "short": "Something that is outmoded is no longer cool or in style, like your dad's outmoded hairstyle that he's had since he was in high school.",
    "long": "The French are known for their sense of fashion and style, so it's no surprise that they coined the word démodé to describe things that are no longer cool. De- means \"out, off, away\" and mode means \"fashion.\" The English word outmoded is simply a translation of démodé: \"out of fashion\" or \"out of style.\""
  },
  "proboscis": {
    "short": "Proboscis is the scientific term for certain mammals' noses, especially long and flexible ones such as an elephant's trunk or a tapir's snout. If someone calls your nose a proboscis, they mean you've got a pretty big 'un.",
    "long": "Proboscis comes from the Greek word for an elephant's trunk, proboskis, which translates as \"means for taking food.\" Not to get too technical, but flies and other insects also have a proboscis, though if you ever end up on \"Jeopardy!\" it's worth knowing that they are not in fact true noses but actually part of their mouths. So there."
  },
  "complete": {
    "short": "Complete means that something is finished, or has all of its necessary parts. When the mechanic hands you your keys, you hope that the work on your car is complete, and he hasn't left out a few important pieces of your engine.",
    "long": "Complete can be used as an adjective to describe something that is whole or finished, like a complete turkey dinner, which includes not only the bird, but also the stuffing, potatoes, cranberry sauce, and gravy. Another way to use complete is as a verb meaning to make something whole. Adding candles  completes the birthday cake."
  },
  "convergent": {
    "short": "If you're a Red Sox fan and your cousin loves the Yankees but you both agree baseball is a wonderful game, that's a convergent idea — in other words an idea that brings you together.",
    "long": "Convergent applies to anything that is arrived at from different paths, not just an idea. Two trains, for example, arriving at the same station from different directions are said to be convergent; or two species of animals inhabiting the same environment that grow more and more alike in habit are also said to be convergent. The opposite of convergent is divergent — as in a Red Sox fan and a Yankees fan arguing about which is the better team."
  },
  "meretricious": {
    "short": "Have you ever heard the phrase \"fake it until you make it\"? That is advice that encourages you to be meretricious, pretending to be something you aren't, like the meretricious flaunting of gigantic fake diamond earrings, pretending they are real — and that you can afford them.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce meretricious, accent the third syllable: \"mer-uh-TRISH-us.\" Don't mistake something that is meretricious for having merit. In fact, it is just the opposite. From an expensive restaurant that looks expensively furnished but when the lights are turned up, you can see that \"leather\" chairs are just cheap vinyl or a woman who pretends her counterfeit handbags are designer originals, meretricious actions are meant to deceive."
  },
  "jocular": {
    "short": "Do you like to make a lot of jokes? Are you often silly? Are you usually happy? If so, then you are a jocular person.",
    "long": "Being jocular has to do with being both jokey and fun. A jocular suggestion is not a serious suggestion — it's a joke. Some people are more jocular than others: anyone who is ultra-serious and always frowning is not jocular. A comedian makes a job of being jocular. Class clowns can't stop being jocular, though the teacher might not always like it. Being jocular is usually considered a good thing: it's not just about making a lot of jokes; it's about being happy and pleasant to be around."
  },
  "misappropriate": {
    "short": "When you misappropriate something, you steal it, or otherwise use it in a way its owner didn't intend.",
    "long": "You might hear the phrase \"to misappropriate funds\" on the news — usually what this means is that someone who has access to money at work has stolen some of it. A banker might misappropriate money, for example, paying himself a bonus, or the manager of a charity might misappropriate donations, using them to buy herself a new car. Misappropriate combines the prefix mis, \"bad or wrong,\" and appropriate, \"take possession of.\""
  },
  "dogmatism": {
    "short": "Dogmatism is a way of thinking that is stubborn and narrow-minded, often because of prejudice and bigotry.",
    "long": "This word has nothing to do with dogs. Rather, it has to do with being dogmatic: holding onto a view or set of views no matter what. The noun form is dogmatism, which is often a type of prejudice such as racism or sexism. Dogmatism includes a disregard for other people's opinions: there's no compromise possible."
  },
  "aggravate": {
    "short": "People who chew with their mouths open often aggravate the people near them, meaning that they exasperate their neighbors.",
    "long": "One trick for remembering the meaning of aggravate is to recall that it rhymes with one of its synonyms, irritate. When you irritate, you aggravate. Younger brothers often aggravate their older brothers, because they find it entertaining to get a reaction out of them. Aggravate is also used to mean \"make worse.\" For example, if you have an old knee injury, it's probably best not to climb Mount Everest, because you might aggravate the injury. If your house is in foreclosure, calling your banker an ugly name is likely only to aggravate the situation. Try a little sweet talk instead!"
  },
  "extend": {
    "short": "The verb extend can have several related meanings, including thrust out, continue, broaden, expand, unfold, span, or increase in scope.",
    "long": "Extend, as a verb, is used in many ways. You extend (hold out) your hand when you offer to shake. You extend (push forward) a deadline when you add a few days to it. Your belly might extend (broaden) after a holiday dinner. A telescope extends (expands) your range of vision. If the list of definitions for extend were infinite, you could extend (add to) that list forever and ever. But your patience might not extend that far."
  },
  "pitch": {
    "short": "In baseball, the ball is pitched (thrown). Elsewhere, writers, salesmen, and other folks make pitches (proposals).",
    "long": "There's a long list of pitches, both nouns and verbs. A salesman can give you a sales pitch, when he tells you all the reasons you should buy what he's selling. A high, short golf shot is a pitch. If you are singing the right notes to a song then you are on pitch. A rocking boat is pitching. The only way to know which pitch is meant is to look at the situation and who's using the word."
  },
  "factotum": {
    "short": "If you're running late and still need to iron your clothes and make breakfast, but can't find your shoes, you may wish you had a factotum, or a servant who does a variety of odd jobs for their employer.",
    "long": "Factotum sounds like the two words “fact” and “totem” spliced together, but this curious noun originally comes from the Latin words that mean \"do\" and \"everything.\" In current times, since servants aren’t typical anymore, we might call someone who has a paid job like this a jack-of-all-trades or possibly a personal assistant."
  },
  "disillusioned": {
    "short": "People who are disillusioned have lost their illusions. This is usually meant in a negative way, as disillusioned people tend to be a little bitter.",
    "long": "When you're disillusioned, you're wiser but not necessarily happier: you've learned from experience that life isn't always how you'd like it to be. Getting divorced could leave you disillusioned about marriage and love. Finding out a teacher cheated could leave you disillusioned about education. We all are disillusioned at some point, and it's usually a bit depressing. Often, ignorance really is bliss."
  },
  "detached": {
    "short": "If something is detached, it stands apart from something else. That goes for people, emotions, retinas, garages, and just about anything else that can be disconnected or uninvolved.",
    "long": "In the simplest sense, detached means \"not attached.\" Which is a fine state to be in if you're talking about houses (it means they're not connected, like row houses) or your neighbor's aggressive dog (who was chomping down on your leg a few minutes ago). But if a person is emotionally detached, be careful: They're not in touch with their own emotions, or very interested in understanding yours."
  },
  "abreast": {
    "short": "There's nothing worse than being stuck on a narrow path behind two people walking abreast of one another. If they only knew you were there, they'd walk single file so you could pass them. Abreast means side by side.",
    "long": "In a marathon, you watch the frontrunners, but it's also important to pay attention to who is coming up the side and abreast of the leader. They are the most likely to find it within themselves to sprint forward for the win. Abreast can also mean \"informed or up-to-date.\" If you're a big fan of comics, you probably keep abreast of all the latest publications and conventions."

  "raconteur": {
    "short": "Raconteurs are gifted storytellers, able to spin amusing tales from everyday life. Who is the biggest raconteur in your group? He or she's the one who always tells the best stories — or jumps in when another storyteller isn't being vivid enough.",
    "long": "Do you make going to the store to buy groceries a fascinating experience? Do you offer witty observations of the people you pass on the street? If so, you're a raconteur, someone who can regale his or her listeners with riveting stories, usually funny, sometimes dramatic. Raconteur comes from the French word \"raconter,\"  meaning \"to recount.\"  Note its \"eur\" ending, signaling its French origin."

  "untenable": {
    "short": "If something is untenable, you can't defend it or justify it. If your disagreement with your teacher puts you in an untenable position, you better just admit you made a mistake and get on with it.",
    "long": "When untenable entered English in the 17th century it meant \"unable to be held against attack.\" That sense still holds true: you can use the adjective untenable to describe any situation, position, or theory that simply can't be defended. Untenable is a great word to use when you want to criticize something, whether it's a flawed system or a referee's bad call."
  },
  "annihilate": {
    "short": "Killing ends when the thing you are killing (your sworn enemy, all hope, a pesky mosquito) is dead. Annihilate goes farther—when you annihilate something, you wipe all trace of it from the earth.",
    "long": "You kill a person, but you annihilate a tribe, a town, or even a species. It's nice to think that the human race made it all the way up until the 16th century before annihilate came to mean what it does now. Might this have something to do with the increasing use of gunpowder around this time?"
  },
  "florid": {
    "short": "Something that's elaborate and full of extra flourishes is florid, whether it's your relatives' ornate decorating style or the way they talk, using a lot of unnecessarily long, complicated words.",
    "long": "Florid is an adjective that entered English in the 17th century, via the French floride, from the Latin flōridus, \"blooming.\" You can probably guess how Florida and flourish are related! Something overly decorated, such as a fussy living room, is florid in the flowery sense, while pale-skinned people with rosy cheeks are florid because they appear to be flourishing with good health."
  },
  "propaganda": {
    "short": "Propaganda is the spreading of information in support of a cause. It’s not so important whether the information is true or false or if the cause is just or not — it’s all propaganda.",
    "long": "The word propaganda is often used in a negative sense, especially for politicians who make false claims to get elected or spread rumors to get their way. In fact, any campaign that is used to persuade can be called propaganda."
  },
  "amortization": {
    "short": "Amortization means a debt is being paid off by a series of payments. An amortization schedule for your car loan will show exactly how much you owe and how long it’ll take to pay it.",
    "long": "Amortization is fancy way to describe a payment plan: you gradually pay off a specific amount by making small payments according to a set schedule. Amortization takes place over a specific period of time. The root of amortization can be traced to the Middle English word amortisen, meaning “to kill.” In this case, it’s a debt that’s being killed off — slowly, over time. The word is often applied to car or home loans."
  },
  "doyen": {
    "short": "Use the noun doyen to describe the person who has been part of a group the longest, such as Mr. Thomas, the doyen of the accounting department. He is the doyen because everyone else joined after he did.",
    "long": "Generally speaking, the doyen isn't just the person who has been there the longest — the doyen is also an expert, perhaps in a specialized area that the others don't know as much about. A doyen is distinguished in a way that earns leadership status, as indicated by the word's origin in the Old French word deien, which comes from the Latin word  decanus, or \"head of ten monks in a monastery\" or \"commander of ten soldiers.\""
  },
  "molt": {
    "short": "When an animal molts, it loses its feathers, fur, skin or maybe even outer skeleton. People don't molt, but plenty of animals do as a normal part of their life cycle.",
    "long": "Despite the guarantees made by late night advertisements, once a human is bald, he's bald forever. Not so for many animals who routinely lose and gain hair, skin or feathers. Think of shedding dogs and snakes crawling out of their old skins. This is the process known as molting. Insects that molt lose their shells or wings, often a sign that they're entering a different part of their life cycle."
  },
  "partisan": {
    "short": "If something is prejudicial towards a particular point of view, you can call it partisan. You'll often hear about partisan politics in the U.S. — since politicians seem to be completely devoted to the agendas of their own parties.",
    "long": "Partisan can be used to describe rabid supporters of any person or activity. In American English, however, it is most often used to refer to politics and the American two-party system of Democrats and Republicans. A bill introduced may have partisan support from the party that introduced the bill, or — more rarely it seems to American voters — the bill may even have bipartisan support. The prefix bi is added to show the support from both parties."
  },
  "declaim": {
    "short": "Use the verb declaim when someone is speaking very passionately against something, like when you declaim against having to be home by 8 p.m.",
    "long": "Declaim can also describe reciting words aloud for practice. If you're learning a new language, you might declaim a sentence until it sounds clear and natural when you say it. Declaim was originally spelled declame, similar to the Latin word declamare, meaning \"to practice public speaking,\" but later became declaim as its other meaning came into greater use."
  },
  "poignant": {
    "short": "Something that is poignant touches you deeply. Watching a poignant YouTube video about baby penguins chasing their mothers, for example, might give you a lump in your throat.",
    "long": "Poignant comes from the Latin pungere \"to prick,\" the same root as pungent. But something that's pungent pricks your sense of smell, whereas poignant refers to something that pricks your emotions, especially in a melancholy way. Movie critics might describe a touching portrayal as poignant if there isn't a dry eye in the house."
  },
  "benefactor": {
    "short": "Every school, museum, and struggling artist is in search for a generous benefactor, or someone to provide the financial means to keep everything running smoothly.",
    "long": "The Latin roots of benefactor are bene, which means \"well,\" and facere, which means \"to do\" — literally, \"to do well.\"  A benefactor does well by supporting (usually financially) a person or a good cause. In the old days, a struggling artist or actor might have been supported by a wealthy benefactor. Now, many struggling artists and actors have to rely on waiting tables and other odd jobs instead."
  },
  "predilection": {
    "short": "A predilection is a preference for or bias toward something. If you have a predilection for wool clothing, you should take up knitting.",
    "long": "Predilection is based on the Latin verb praediligere, or \"prefer before others,\" which breaks down to prae, before, and diligere, \"choose or love.\" We often use the word predilection for tendencies that people seem to have been born with, also called predispositions. If you're a night owl, you probably have a predilection for cities, while morning people tend to prefer the country."
  },
  "occlude": {
    "short": "Occlude means to obstruct, as with an opening. You hear this a lot in a medical context. Heart surgeons are looking for occlusions in blood vessels — things that occlude the flow of blood.",
    "long": "Occlude does not exist only in a medical context. If you close the bathroom door so your little brother won't come in while you're trying out makeup with your friends, you're occluding the bathroom. Meanwhile, your makeup occludes your pores."
  },
  "mental": {
    "short": "The adjective mental describes anything having to do with the mind, just as \"physical\" has to do with the body. Mental has to do with the intellect, the mind, or the brain.",
    "long": "There's a history of mental illness in that family, which is interesting because physically they're all so amazing. Makes you wonder why they did so well in one department but not the other. Some argue that standardized tests are no measure of your mental abilities. All they do is tell you how well you did on the test. That would be like testing your emotional depth based on how tightly you hug people. A person's mental gifts are difficult to measure."
  },
  "distribute": {
    "short": "To distribute is to disperse widely, hand out, or spread around. While you're still snoozing, the paper boy is busy distributing the newspaper all over the neighborhood.",
    "long": "This verb was first recorded in the early 15th century and has its roots in the Latin distributus, meaning “to divide.” Think of dividing up the last cookies in the cookie jar and passing them out to all your friends. Distribute can also mean to space out or arrange in a particular order — you'd want to distribute the chairs in even lines across the floor when setting up for a concert, for example."
  },
  "immune": {
    "short": "To be immune to something is to be resistant to it. If you had chickenpox as a child, you should be immune to it now.",
    "long": "The adjective immune comes from the Latin word immunis, which means “exempt from public service.” If you're protected — or exempt — from disease, injury, work, insults, or accusations, then you're immune. Vaccinations serve to make people immune to certain diseases. Being a diplomat makes people immune to certain legal persecution. To be immune to bullying means that you don’t let the bad behavior of your peers get you down."
  },
  "illustrate": {
    "short": "To illustrate is to make something more clear or visible. Children's books are illustrated with pictures. An example can illustrate an abstract idea.",
    "long": "The word illustrate comes from the Latin illustrare 'to light up or enlighten.' Pictures in a book enlighten the reader, and a good example can enlighten someone on a complex topic. Another use: The government's actions illustrate how out of touch it is with the people. The history of this word illustrates how language changes over time, and how knowing the original meaning can help you understand the word in a deeper way."
  },
  "flexible": {
    "short": "Something that is flexible is easily bent without breaking. The flexible drinking straw was invented in the 1930s by a man who saw his daughter struggling to drink a milkshake with a straight paper straw.",
    "long": "The word flexible can refer to bendable physical objects or to intangibles like a person's mind, which can be changed. It can even refer to work environments that can adapt schedules and benefits to fit a worker's individual needs. Being physically flexible usually means good health, with no pain in movement. In all, it's great to be flexible, to be able to bend without breaking and bounce back, ready to keep going."
  },
  "incumbent": {
    "short": "An incumbent is an official who holds an office. If you want to run for congress, you're going to have to beat the incumbent.",
    "long": "Incumbent comes from the Latin word incumbens, which means \"lying in\" or \"leaning on,\" but came to mean \"holding a position.\" It was first used in English for someone holding a church office, and then someone holding any office. You'll most likely hear it today for political officials. In a race for mayor, the incumbent mayor faces a challenger. Incumbent also means \"required by obligation.\" It is incumbent upon you to do the dishes."
  },
  "vigorous": {
    "short": "Anything vigorous is done with force and energy. Vigorous exercise makes you sweat, and a vigorous denial makes someone else sweat.",
    "long": "Vigorous is a description for something strong or enthusiastic. It comes from the French word vigour, meaning \"liveliness, activity.\" An active, physically energetic person is vigorous, and mental activities can be vigorous too, when they require a lot of mental effort. A vigorous argument doesn’t have to include physical wrestling; it just might involve verbal sparring."
  },
  "connotation": {
    "short": "When you're talking about the implied subtext of words rather than their literal meaning, reach for the noun connotation. A political boss might not want to be called \"boss\" because of the negative connotations.",
    "long": "From the Latin com- \"with\" + notare \"to mark,\" this word is all about reading between the lines. The literal meaning (or denotation) of Wall Street, for instance, is \"a street in lower Manhattan that's home to many financial institutions,\" but the same phrase's connotations may include \"wealth,\" \"power,\" or \"greed,\" depending on your experiences and opinions. A closely related word is implication."
  },
  "truncated": {
    "short": "Truncated is an adjective that means \"cut short,\" like a truncated picnic, caused by the sudden downpour.",
    "long": "The word comes from the root truncate, which is of Latin origin, and means \"cut off.\" When an object is truncated, its end or point is cut off, like a truncated arrow that is safe for kids to play with. Truncated can also refer to something that ends earlier than planned — everyone was angry at the truncated concert until they learned that the singer had broken his leg when he fell on stage."
  },
  "catastrophe": {
    "short": "A catastrophe is a disaster. If a wedding reception is disrupted by a fistfight between the bride and her new mother-in-law, you could call the occasion a catastrophe.",
    "long": "Catastrophe comes from a Greek word meaning \"overturn.\" It originally referred to the disastrous finish of a drama, usually a tragedy. The definition was extended to mean \"any sudden disaster\" in the 1700s. Nowadays, catastrophe can be used to refer to very tragic events as well as more minor ones. A hurricane destroying hundreds of homes is certainly a catastrophe; baking a birthday cake without following a recipe might also result in catastrophe, if you don't know anything about cooking."
  },
  "clique": {
    "short": "A clique is an exclusive group of people or friends. Before Rudolph pulled Santa's sled through the fog, the clique of flying reindeer never let him play their reindeer games.",
    "long": "In high school, the exclusive nature of cliques causes a lot of hurt feelings. Clique carries this less than nice feeling with it wherever it goes, whether it be a set of elites who surround a government official, a group of popular kids who don't let others join their group or the closed circle of people at the office who always make sure they get the best jobs."
  },
  "oust": {
    "short": "A teacher may oust you from class if you are being disruptive, or you might oust your class president from her position if you beat her in the election. To oust is to “expel,” “kick out,” or “remove and replace.”",
    "long": "When you oust someone, you are “giving them the boot.” A sports team is ousted from a tournament if they lose an elimination round. Oust often implies both removal and replacement. The automobile, for instance, ousted the horse as the preferred means of travel. Likewise, when a politician ousts someone from office they are taking that person’s place in office. And if you beat the all-time record in a hot-dog eating tournament, then you oust the previous record holder from their position."
  },
  "trite": {
    "short": "When you want to indicate that something is silly or overused, you would call it trite. A love song with lyrics about holding hands in the sunshine? Totally trite.",
    "long": "Trite has a Latin root, the past participle of terere, meaning \"wear out.\" An old-fashioned or outdated definition of the word is \"frayed or worn out by use,\" and you can see how the meaning for an object that is worn out can be applied to an idea that has been used to the point of being meaningless. The antonym of this word is original."
  },
  "analgesia": {
    "short": "Analgesia is the absence of pain. However, the person in that state is still conscious.",
    "long": "If you've ever broken a bone or had a severe injury, you might have taken painkillers. A good painkiller can produce analgesia: a condition in which you're conscious but pain-free. If you suffer from headaches, stomachaches, bad knees, a sore back, or any other kind of pain, analgesia is a state you'd like to be in. People with chronic pain never get to experience analgesia. Anything that relieves pain can be called an analgesic."
  },
  "reptile": {
    "short": "A reptile is one of those mostly scaly and slimy animals that are cold-blooded and have backbones. Lizards and turtles? Yep — both reptiles. Puppies and kittens? No way.",
    "long": "There are many classes of animals. People are part of the mammal class. Another class is reptiles, which are all cold-blooded vertebrates (meaning they have backbones). Snakes, turtles, tortoises, lizards, alligators, chameleons, geckos, skinks, and crocodiles are all reptiles. You'll see plenty of reptiles at the zoo, and you'll see replicas of some at a natural history museum — since dinosaurs were reptiles!"
  },
  "epigraph": {
    "short": "An epigraph is an engraved inscription on a building or statue, or a quotation at the beginning of a piece of writing.",
    "long": "If you look on the U.S. government minted coins in your pocket, you'll see the epigraph \"In God We Trust.\" Epigraph comes from the Greek roots epi- (\"on\") and graphein (\"write\"), a root you'll recognize from autograph, graphite, graphic novel, and lots of other familiar words that have to do with writing or drawing."
  },
  "deflect": {
    "short": "The verb deflect describes blocking something or changing its course. Hockey goalies deflect the flying puck with their sticks or blockers, making it travel in a different direction, preferably to a teammate's stick.",
    "long": "In a cartoon, a mouse might ask an approaching cat, \"Hey, what's that up in the sky?\" When the cat looks up, the mouse runs away, successful in his attempt to deflect the cat's attention. When you deflect, you throw someone or something off course, often by using a distraction. Another way to deflect something — such as criticism — is to blame someone else. Eventually the truth, like the cat who quickly sees there's nothing unusual up in the sky, catches up with those who deflect."
  },
  "tortuous": {
    "short": "Tortuous means twisting or complicated. \"James Bond drove up a mountain road that was tortuous in its twists and turns. He had to stop the evil madman's plan for world domination, a plan so tortuous that even 007 himself could not understand it.\"",
    "long": "From Latin torquere \"to twist,\" tortuous means something with twists and turns –– a path, an argument, a story. It is important not to confuse it with torturous, which means characterized by great pain. \"The contemporary string quartet was tortuous in its tonal shifts, but only torturous at the point where the violinist ran her nails up and down a chalkboard.\""
  },
  "chastise": {
    "short": "Chastise is a fancy word for telling someone that something they did was really bad. If you pick your nose, your mom will probably yell at you. If you pick your nose in front of the Queen of England, your mom will chastise you.",
    "long": "Back in the Middle Ages, chastise used to also come with a beating — that sense of the word has passed, and in fact, people tend to use chastise when they are trying to accuse someone else of overreacting. \"You're chastising me for forgetting to feed the cat, but it's not like the cat died!\""

  },
  "testimony": {
    "short": "When you give testimony you are telling what you saw or what you know.  Your testimony that your hand was not in the cookie jar goes against the testimony of several eyewitnesses.",
    "long": "The Latin root for testimony is testis, meaning “ witness.” “Eye witness testimony” is a phrase you will hear often in legal discussions. An object can also give testimony, without speaking of course:  \"The statue they built of you outside the bowling alley offers testimony to your greatness.\""
  },
  "emaciate": {
    "short": "To emaciate is to make someone extremely thin or very weak. A serious illness can often emaciate a person, leaving them gaunt and frail.",
    "long": "The verb emaciate is much less common than its related adjective, emaciated. Both stem from the Latin emaciare, \"make lean, cause to waste away.\" Whenever a person has become malnourished in a way that's evident just from looking at them, you can use this word: \"The ravages of the Irish potato famine emaciated the starving people all across the country, eventually causing a million deaths.\""
  },
  "badger": {
    "short": "Badger is to bother. Persistently. On and on. Without stop. Relentlessly. Over and over. Endlessly. It comes from the name of that chipmunk-like animal that burrows into the ground.",
    "long": "If you badger someone, you get under their skin. A badger is an animal that digs tunnels under ground to keep warm. To badger can also mean to persuade someone through constant annoying efforts. You might badger your mom to add another hour to your curfew or badger your friend to give you a turn with a video game he has been hogging."
  },
  "disjointed": {
    "short": "Disjointed isn’t when you can bend your thumb all the way backwards — that’s double-jointed. Disjointed means \"unorganized\" or \"disconnected.\"",
    "long": "Disjointed is an adjective that describes something as disconnected, illogical, or just messed up. A disjointed argument is an argument that doesn’t make a lot of sense. The same can be said for a disjointed sentence or a disjointed speech. In a medical sense, disjointed means \"dislocated,\" or “separated at the joint.” When someone gets injured, they may end up with a disjointed shoulder or a disjointed hip."
  },
  "consonant": {
    "short": "A consonant is a speech sound that is not a vowel. It also refers to letters of the alphabet that represent those sounds: Z, B, T, G, and H are all consonants.",
    "long": "Consonants are all the non-vowel sounds, or their corresponding letters: A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y are not consonants. In hat, H and T are consonants. Consonant can also be an adjective that describes things that seem like they should go together, things that are \"agreeable.\" You could say a nation's offer of aid is consonant with their treaties. When you hear consonant sounds in music, they are pleasing, the opposite of \"dissonant\" sounds which are harsh."
  },
  "dedication": {
    "short": "Dedication means \"committing yourself to something,\" like your dedication to marathon training that had you running every single morning for four months.",
    "long": "Dedication can be complete devotion and faith in someone or something, like your dedication to your family, a ceremony in which something is officially named, like the dedication of a new building. Another kind of dedication is a short message written to someone, like the dedication \"Happy Birthday, Uncle Fred,\" which you write inside the book you give him, or something extra added to an autograph, like \"To my greatest fan!\""
  },
  "tour": {
    "short": "Use the noun tour to describe a route taken while sight-seeing or the act of experiencing a place, like a tour of Italy in which travelers tour museums and churches.",
    "long": "Not all tours have to do with vacations. In fact, a tour can be quite the opposite, such as a snowplow driver whose tour during a blizzard lasts until the streets are clear, or military personnel who serve a tour of duty in the place they are assigned. These kinds of tours involve a commitment of work or service for a certain period of time."
  },
  "idiosyncrasy": {
    "short": "If a person has an idiosyncrasy, he or she has a little quirk, or a funny behavior, that makes him or her different. If you only say goodbye in French, never in English, that would be an idiosyncrasy.",
    "long": "Idio seems like it means stupid, but really it is Latin for \"one's own,\" as an idiosyncrasy is one's own particular, usually odd, behavior. Putting salt in your hot chocolate or needing the light on to sleep or tapping your head while you think are all idiosyncrasies. A machine such as a DVD player has an idiosyncrasy if you have to do something weird to it to make it work like having to bang it on the back left-hand side to stop it from skipping."
  },
  "dispassionate": {
    "short": "Dispassionate describes someone who is not getting carried away by — or maybe not even having — feelings. It's something you'd want to see in a surgeon, who keeps cool under pressure, but not in a romantic partner.",
    "long": "Dispassionate is the opposite of passionate, and while passions are said to run \"hot,\" dispassionate people are often described as \"cold.\" Many people think that a judge should be dispassionate when deciding a case — unaffected by strong emotions or preconceived prejudices."
  },
  "seductive": {
    "short": "Seductive is an adjective that describes the fascinating magnetic pull that someone or something has, an attractive quality that tempts you in some way.",
    "long": "A seductive person catches your eye and won’t let it go.  The word comes from the Latin seducere, meaning “draw aside.”  When someone draws your attention aside from whatever you’re doing, that is a seductive person.  Radio people often have seductive voices that lull you to sleep, and stores put their most seductive items in the front window in hopes that you’ll be tempted to come inside and buy them."
  },
  "flippant": {
    "short": "When a parent scolds a teenager for missing a curfew or blowing off a test and the teen snaps back, \"Whatever,\" you could say the teen is being flippant. His reply was casual to the point of sarcasm and disrespect.",
    "long": "When it first showed up in the English language around the 17th century, flippant meant glib and talkative. But over the years it has developed a more negative connotation. Today flippant is used to describe a blasé attitude or comment in a situation that calls for seriousness. Make a flippant comment about your friend's mother and the odds are good that they'll be offended."
  },
  "sartorial": {
    "short": "If it's the day before a big event and you have no idea what to wear and nothing in your closet is going to cut it, you are facing a sartorial dilemma — one that pertains to clothing, fashion, or dressing.",
    "long": "Sartorial comes from the Modern Latin word sartor which means \"tailor,\" literally \"one who patches and mends.\" In English the adjectives sartorial and sartorially are used to refer to any matter pertaining to the consideration of clothing or fashion. The root word sartor has also made its way into the field of biology. The sartorius — a muscle in the leg and the longest muscle in the human body — gets its name because it is used when crossing the legs, also known as the “tailor's position.\""
  },
  "elude": {
    "short": "Elude means \"evade or escape,\" like the way you might elude the other kids during a game of hide-and-seek. This word can also mean \"to be hard to understand.\" No matter how hard you try, the finer points of quantum physics might elude you.",
    "long": "Elude has a slippery feeling to it. You elude the police, math can elude you — and that yak you went to see on safari but never got a glimpse of, you might say that he has eluded you as well. Delude means \"to deceive,\" and there are times when someone can both delude and elude you — like when the conman took your money and then escaped out the back door."
  },
  "ineptitude": {
    "short": "Ineptitude is a lack of skill, ability, or competence. A doctor would prove his ineptitude at practicing medicine if he mistakenly removed a patient's spleen instead of his kidney.",
    "long": "Ineptitude and incompetence are synonyms to describe people who have absolutely no idea what they're doing. It's definitely not a quality you'd want in a pilot, who might prove his ineptitude by sending a plane full of passengers hurtling to the ground. Ineptitude also isn't a good quality to have in fields like medicine, where even one careless mistake could be life-threatening."
  },
  "animadvert": {
    "short": "When you animadvert upon something, you criticize it openly and harshly. A high school debater might animadvert on the subject of the death penalty, for example.",
    "long": "The verb animadvert is a great word to use when you need a formal way to talk about a public condemnation of something or someone. A tourist might animadvert upon the entire country of Italy after a disappointing vacation there, or a politician might take advantage of a public forum to animadvert on the issue of high taxes. The Latin root word is animadvertere, \"to notice or take cognizance of,\" or \"to censure, blame, or punish.\""
  },
  "perverse": {
    "short": "Something that's perverse is deviant — it's not completely acceptable, and it may be even a little strange. Your perverse sense of humor probably makes some of your friends laugh while others just look uncomfortable.",
    "long": "Something perverse is unusual, possibly somewhat weird, and even immoral, like that time the odd kid in class announced that a love poem was really all about lovingly poisoning squirrels and no one sat next to him for a week afterwards. That kid's perspective was perverse. Perverse can also mean \"stubbornly contradictory\" or \"perverted.\" The word originally meant \"wicked,\" from the Latin perversus, \"turned away or askew,\" and figuratively, \"turned away from what is right.\""
  },
  "maven": {
    "short": "Whether it's in fashion, or food, or forensic science, someone who really knows his stuff about a topic is a maven, or a person particularly skilled in the field.",
    "long": "The word maven comes from the Yiddish meyvn, meaning \"one who understands.\" But to be a maven you have to more than just understand a topic, you have to know its ins and outs. Often mavens are the people that you turn to as experts in a field. You don't become a maven overnight. That kind of expertise comes with an accumulation of knowledge over the years."
  },
  "resolution": {
    "short": "The noun resolution has a few related meanings having to do with being firmly determined about something. If you lack determination, you'll never fulfill your New Year's resolutions.",
    "long": "Resolution is the noun form of the verb resolve, derived from the Latin resolvere, \"to loosen, undo, settle.\" We can still see this meaning of resolution in the sense of \"an explanation\" or \"a solution\" — when a problem, conflict, or mystery reaches its resolution, it has been \"undone,\" so to speak. If you approach a task with resolution, you do it with determination. And if you make a resolution, you make a firm decision to do something or meet some goal."
  },
  "propitiation": {
    "short": "Propitiation is an action meant to regain someone's favor or make up for something you did wrong. You might offer your mom a plate of chocolate chip cookies in propitiation for killing all her houseplants while she was away.",
    "long": "Propitiation comes from a form of the Latin verb \"propitiare,\" which means “to appease.” If you’re doing something in propitiation, that’s your basic goal: to regain favor. Propitiation often involves a god or gods, traditional or not. If your team lost last year's championship, propitiation of the football gods may be necessary this year. More broadly you can offer propitiation to anyone you need to appease. Propitiation may be needed if you show up late to class again."
  },
  "intransigence": {
    "short": "If you refuse to compromise with your sister about whose turn it is to do the dishes, your mother might accuse you both of intransigence. Intransigence is a stubborn refusal to change your views.",
    "long": "Inside of intransigence you see the Latin transigere which means \"to come to an understanding.\" People who show intransigence refuse to do this. Nations are often accused of intransigence when they refuse to comply with international standards or will."
  },
  "minuscule": {
    "short": "When something is teeny tiny, it is minuscule. If your mother calls your miniskirt minuscule, it probably means she wants you to change into something a bit less revealing.",
    "long": "In minuscule, you see the word, minus, which means lesser. The word minuscule has its roots in the Latin expression minuscula littera, a phrase used to describe the smaller letters in text. In the late 1800s, the use of the word expanded to mean very small in general — so the definition of minuscule became less minuscule."
  },
  "supersede": {
    "short": "When something supersedes, it takes the place of something else. The 5th edition of your history textbook supersedes the 4th edition.",
    "long": "Most words that include super have something good going on. Supersede is from the 16th-century Latin for \"sit on top,\" and it often means to replace with something better. A version 10 of a computer game will supersede, version 9, making it more exciting. Unfortunately, a person might be replaced too, as in \"the younger running back will supersede the veteran player as he gets older.\" To supersede is generally a good thing, but being superseded is not always that great for the replaced person."
  },
  "palpable": {
    "short": "When something is palpable, you can touch or handle it, even though the word is often used to describe things that usually can't be handled or touched, such as emotions or sensations.",
    "long": "You probably won't see palpable used to describe, say, an egg or a doorknob or a motorcycle. Palpable is usually reserved for situations in which something invisible becomes so intense that it feels as though it has substance or weight. Someone who has experienced a death in the family might say that her grief feels palpable."
  },
  "dissonant": {
    "short": "If things don't go together well, you can call them dissonant. Dissonant voices are saying different things. Dissonant clothing choices clash. Dissonant chords lack harmony.",
    "long": "The word dissonant comes from the Old French dis- meaning \"apart\" and sonare meaning \"to sound.\" When a noise is dissonant, it sounds like it's broken apart, or not meshing together well. Dissonant doesn't have to describe just music or sounds.  It can also refer to something that clashes or doesn't fit well together. When two people's versions of a story are dissonant, that means they don't match. Either one of them is lying or they just don't see eye-to-eye."
  },
  "potpourri": {
    "short": "The noun potpourri can refer to a mixture or collection of seemingly unrelated items, an unusual assortment. You may own a potpourri of books — from classic literature to trashy novels and from Shakespeare's plays to comic books.",
    "long": "The noun potpourri often refers to a scented mixture of spices and dried flowers that is usually kept in a decorative bowl or jar and used to perfume a room. What's interesting is that the name for this attractively fragrant mixture comes from the French phrase pot pourri, which literally means \"rotten pot.\" The phrase was used to describe a stew. Clearly, some things translate better than others."

  "objurgation": {
    "short": "Objurgation is a harsh reprimand or criticism. A teenager who gets home hours after his midnight curfew can expect objurgation from his angry parents.",
    "long": "When someone receives a severe scolding, that person experiences objurgation. Members of Congress sometimes seem to set themselves up for objurgation from their constituents, and a badly behaving class shouldn't be surprised at the objurgation they get from the teacher. Objurgation has been around since the 1500's, and it comes from the Latin word obiurgationem, \"a chiding, reproving, or reproof.\""
  },
  "imprecation": {
    "short": "If you really don't like someone you can shout out an imprecation at them. More than simply the use of bad language (although that can be involved, too), an imprecation is a damning curse wishing them nothing but ill.",
    "long": "Originally from a Latin word meaning to \"invoke evil\" or \"bring down bad spirits upon.\" Not to be confused with implication, a similar-sounding word with the completely unrelated meaning of implying something indirectly. These are two very commonly confused words, so be careful. You don't want an imprecation blasted down upon you from someone who really cares about language."

  "premise": {
    "short": "A premise is what forms the basis of a theory or a plot. When you called 911 on the guy in your back yard, it was on the premise that he was a thief and not the meter-reader.",
    "long": "In logic, the premise is the basic statement upon whose truth an argument is based. Criticize alternative theories by demonstrating their false premises.  In a more general sense, it's a basic assertion. On the premise that people are generally good, you keep your doors unlocked. Premise is also used more loosely for the starting point for a plot. A movie's premise could be that two people trapped on a desert island will inevitably fall in love."

    "long": "The adjective transitional relates to things such as governments, office spaces, or aspects of one’s life that are in the process of changing. This is a temporary state, until a permanent solution is established, and the word is often used with a sense of hope. For example, when someone goes through a romantic breakup and is hoping to find someone new, she might also say she is in a transitional phase. A synonym for transitional is interim."

  "burlesque": {
    "short": "In contemporary usage, burlesque is a playfully nostalgic form of striptease — think fans and feather boas rather than explicit nudity — but this is just the latest form of an ironic style of entertainment dating back to medieval times.",
    "long": "Burlesque comes from burla, Spanish for \"joke.\" Comedy has always been an essential part of burlesque art, but it's comedy of a particular kind. Burlesque is satirical, and it uses exaggeration that can be extreme. Early examples of burlesque in English literature can be found in the Canterbury Tales. By the eighteenth century, the word was used to describe often risqué parodies of serious operas or plays. Burlesque became associated with striptease in the music halls and vaudeville theaters of nineteenth-century America."

  "erstwhile": {
    "short": "If your dad used to play in a punk band, but is now a computer programmer, you could call him an erstwhile punk rocker. Erstwhile means \"former.\"",
    "long": "Erstwhile comes from Old English and is a formal way to say \"former.\" You can go to your class reunion 20 years after you graduate high school and see your erstwhile friends. That means that they had been your friends, but you lost touch with them, so that they weren't friends of yours anymore. Erstwhile can also be used as an adverb, meaning “formerly or once” — “Erstwhile, I was a member of the high school debate team.”"
  },
  "luxurious": {
    "short": "The adjective luxurious describes something that is of very high quality or expensive taste, like your luxurious living room filled with the softest rugs and gorgeous furniture hand-crafted in Italy.",
    "long": "In the 14th century, luxurious didn't mean what it does today; it meant \"lascivious, lecherous, unchaste.\" What happened? The invention of bling for one thing, and the rise of a culture that celebrates material pleasures. Today, luxurious translates as exclusive, comfortable, expensive and superior in quality, like a luxurious home featured in a magazine about rich people and their favorite things."
  },
  "purify": {
    "short": "To purify something is to remove dirt, chemicals, or anything else that it's contaminated with. You might decide to purify your tap water if it tastes like chlorine.",
    "long": "While scientists purify various chemicals during experiments, the substance that people most often purify is water. Water needs to be treated before it's safe to drink, and cities purify the water they send out to people's houses. You can also use the verb purify in a figurative way, to mean \"make ritually or religiously clean or pure.\" This is the word's earliest meaning, from the Latin root purificare, \"to make pure.\""
  },
  "irascible": {
    "short": "If you're irascible, you get angry easily — perhaps blowing up in rage when someone brushes into you.",
    "long": "Irascible comes from the Latin root ira, which means \"anger\" or \"rage,\" the same root that gives us  the word ire, \"anger.\" The -sc in the middle of irascible, means \"becoming,\" so irascible doesn't just mean you're angry — it's got action built into it. If you're looking for a fight most of the time, then you're irascible — ready for the spark that's going to set you on fire."
  },
  "confound": {
    "short": "If you have an identical twin, you've probably tried dressing alike so that people confound you with, or mistake you for, one another. You've also probably learned that, unfortunately, this trick doesn’t work on your mom.",
    "long": "The verb confound means both \"to mistake\" and \"to confuse.\" If you decide to treat yourself to a delicious dessert, you might find yourself confounded by the overwhelming number of choices. If you end up ordering the chocolate cake but the waiter brings you chocolate mousse, the waiter has somehow confounded those two options. Another meaning you may come across in literature is \"to damn,\" as in \"Confound it! You are the most exasperating person on the planet.\""
  },
  "distaff": {
    "short": "A distaff is a tool used to spin fibers into flax or wool. The oldest type of distaff was held under one arm as the spinner slowly unwound fibers from it and onto a spindle in the opposite hand.",
    "long": "Spinning wool is an old-fashioned craft, so it's not common to see a distaff in use these days. Some are attachments on spinning wheels, while others are turned by hand. As it was traditionally women who wielded distaffs, the word came to be used to mean \"women's work\" in general, as early as the 14th century. Today it's also an adjective meaning \"concerning women.\" So instead of planning a girls' night out, your sister might instead arrange a \"distaff gathering.\""
  },
  "accidental": {
    "short": "Anything accidental happens by chance or unintentionally. People don't mean to do accidental things.",
    "long": "An accident is something unforeseen that no one wanted to happen, like a car accident or getting hit by lightning. You can describe anything like that as accidental. Bumping into a stranger could be accidental. Forgetting to pay a bill is accidental. This word covers all the things that no one really meant or planned to happen. There are a lot of accidental events in the world, which is one reason insurance exists."
  },
  "hierarchy": {
    "short": "Hierarchy describes a system that organizes or ranks things, often according to power or importance. At school the principal is at the top of the staff hierarchy, while the seniors rule the student hierarchy.",
    "long": "Also known as a pecking order or power structure, a hierarchy is a formalized or simply implied understanding of who's on top or what's most important. All that sorting and ranking can be helpful if you're a business administrator, but if you find yourself arranging all the produce in your fridge according to a hierarchy of color, size, and expiration date, you might want to consider visiting a therapist."

  "demise": {
    "short": "Resort to the noun demise when you describe the end, termination, or death of something or someone.",
    "long": "Demise is mostly used in medical or legal language, or when someone wants to sound either formal or euphemistic. The word entered English from French demettre which means \"to dismiss,\" from the Latin word mittere, meaning \"let go, send.\" And you might think, after reading this quote from E. Phillips Oppenheim, that demise sounds somewhat old-fashioned: \"That my demise would have been a relief to you I can, of course, easily believe, but the means — they surely were not worthy of your ingenuity.\""
  },
  "splenetic": {
    "short": "Anyone who's splenetic is very cranky and even a little mean. If you want to have fun at the bowling alley, don't invite your splenetic cousin to come along — he always ends up hurting someone's feelings.",
    "long": "Splenetic was originally used to describe anything having to do with the spleen, the blood-filtering organ in human bodies. Western medicine once attributed both physical health and personality to four \"bodily humours,\" one of which was black bile, thought to be produced by the spleen. Doctors back then believed that black bile made people moody and cranky — in other words, splenetic. Though medicine has changed dramatically, you can still use this word for irritable, bad-tempered people."
  },
  "catalyst": {
    "short": "A catalyst is an event or person causing a change. Getting kicked out of your parents' house might be a catalyst for becoming more independent.",
    "long": "The noun catalyst is something or someone that causes a change and is derived from the Greek word katalύein, meaning \"to dissolve.\" It can be somewhat ordinary, like when moving to a warmer climate was the catalyst for getting a short, sporty haircut. Or it can be major, like how the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire is said to be a catalyst of World War I."
  },
  "archival": {
    "short": "Anything archival relates to an archive, which is a record or collection of historical materials. Archival resources document the past. Most libraries have a special place for archival documents, like old newspapers and photos.",
    "long": "An archive is a collection of older things such as books, music, or documents. Many librarians and curators collect and care for archives. Anything archival relates to an archive. An archival record documents everything in an archive, such as an archive of 19th century poetry. An archival search is a search of an archive, such as an archive of birth certificates. This word has to do with historical collections. Scholars who study the past often have to do archival research."

  "arcane": {
    "short": "Something arcane is understood or known by only a few people. Almost everyone knows the basics of baseball, but only an elite few possess the arcane knowledge of its history that marks the true fan.",
    "long": "A near synonym is esoteric, as in \"relating to remote information or knowledge.\" Experts in academic fields often show off the depth of their knowledge by mentioning some arcane and esoteric fact as if it was common for everyone to know. The origin of arcane is Latin arcānus, \"secret, closed,\" from arca, \"a chest, box.\" Arcana (singular arcanum) are pieces of mysterious knowledge or information."
  },
  "maelstrom": {
    "short": "A maelstrom is a powerful whirlpool. A luckless ship might go down in one, and conflicting ocean currents might cause one. These days, you're more likely to hear maelstrom used metaphorically to describe disasters where many competing forces are at play.",
    "long": "When an economy or a government fails, the situation is often described as a maelstrom. Following some precipitous event, all the forces at play — banks, governments, consumers — are trying as hard as they can to protect themselves. This creates a maelstrom — a perfect storm, so to speak — that drags any potential for rescue down with it. Maelstrom comes from an obsolete Dutch phrase meaning \"whirling stream.\""
  },
  "churlish": {
    "short": "A churlish person is one whose middle name might as well be Rude. He’s the one who was never taught to mind his manners and avoid telling vulgar jokes at the dinner table.",
    "long": "Churlish has its origins in late Old English, but its modern-day meaning of “deliberately rude” developed in the 14th century. It’s a fitting adjective to describe boorish or surly behavior. It can also describe a material that is difficult to work with, such as hard wood that’s resistant to quick whittling. Our prolific pal Shakespeare coined the phrase, “as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear.”"
  },
  "consensus": {
    "short": "When there's a consensus, everyone agrees on something. If you're going to a movie with friends, you need to reach a consensus about which movie everyone wants to see.",
    "long": "Ever notice how people disagree about just about everything, from who's the best baseball player to how high taxes should be? Whenever there's disagreement, there's no consensus: consensus means everyone is on the same page. When you're talking about all the people in the world, it's hard to find a consensus on anything. There are just too many opinions. However, in a smaller group, reaching a consensus is possible."
  },
  "infallible": {
    "short": "\"Fallible\" means capable of making mistakes — or, easier to remember — capable of failing. Infallible means exactly the opposite — incapable of failing.",
    "long": "This word is often used to describe human capacity for error — no one is infallible. And yet, we are able to be infallible in certain ways: children are infallibly curious, teenagers infallibly hungry. Interestingly, infallible derives from the Latin in- \"not\" + fallere \"deceive.\" When did making a mistake and deception become the same thing?"
  },
  "extenuate": {
    "short": "To extenuate is to make less of something or try to minimize its importance. The fact that you walked your little sister to school because she missed the bus might extenuate your teacher's response when you show up late.",
    "long": "Extenuate goes back to the Latin verb extenuāre, meaning \"to thin\" or \"make thin.\" Someone might have a strong case against you for doing something wrong, but an added consideration can make less serious, or extenuate, the circumstances that led to it. If you give an excuse that doesn't really relate to what was done, it won't extenuate the punishment. If something has a real bearing on what went wrong, it will extenuate the response, and you'll get in less trouble."
  },
  "bless": {
    "short": "To bless is to offer a holy seal of approval, like when a priest blesses water, making holy water. It’s also what people say when you sneeze: bless you, which is short for “may God bless you.”",
    "long": "If you go back far enough, the word bless is related to the word blood, because of the blood sprinkled on pagan alters. It moved on to mean “to praise,” and now it’s a little of both (minus the pagans). In religious contexts, things are made holy when they're blessed. Also, people are blessed by good things that happen. People often say things like \"I've been blessed with good health.” That means they were lucky to receive such good things."
  },
  "verisimilitude": {
    "short": "Verisimilitude means being believable, or having the appearance of being true. You can improve your play by using the sounds and smells of the beach as well as lots of sand to create verisimilitude.",
    "long": "Verisimilitude comes from the Latin verisimilitudo, \"likeness to truth\" and is used to describe stories. In it, you'll see the word similar, meaning it is similar to what's real. Art that aims for realism seeks verisimilitude. An actual synonym for verisimilitude is truthlikeness. Tell that to your friends, and they'll probably think that your story lacks verisimilitude."
  },
  "phonetic": {
    "short": "Phonetic describes the way that spoken words sound. To sound out an unfamiliar word, you break it into its phonetic parts, saying each in the order in which it appears.",
    "long": "When you use the word phonetic, you're talking about pronunciation, or the way language sounds. When you learn how to speak Chinese, for example, you're often taught both traditional Chinese characters and a phonetic alphabet, which helps people learn to correctly pronounce Chinese words. The Greek word for sound or voice is phone, and it's the root of phonetic, which was first used in the early 1800s."
  },
  "apprehensive": {
    "short": "If you're apprehensive, you're anxious or fearful. If you live near a busy intersection with no stop signs, you might be a bit apprehensive about crossing the street.",
    "long": "Apprehensive is from a Latin word meaning \"to seize,\" and it originally meant \"quick to seize impressions or ideas, perceptive, intelligent.\" Now it means \"anticipating something bad, fearful of what may happen.\" Synonyms are afraid, which suggest a more immediate fear, and fearful, which suggests a more general temperament (\"a fearful child\"). You can be apprehensive about a situation while being an optimistic and courageous person in general."
  },
  "proxy": {
    "short": "Don't feel like going to the grocery store today? See if you can send your brother as a proxy, meaning he's a substitute authorized to act for you.",
    "long": "Now, don't get crazy about getting your brother to do everything for you. Running your errands is one thing, but if you're a historian and your brother is an accountant, he is not a good proxy for you when you don't feel like researching your book about Napoleon. And you wouldn't be a good proxy for him in his work. A proxy must be well-chosen to truly act on another person's behalf."
  },
  "surrogate": {
    "short": "Someone who acts as a surrogate takes the place of another person. If a celebrity leaves her seat to use the restroom in the middle of a big Hollywood awards ceremony, a surrogate will take her place until she returns.",
    "long": "Surrogate comes from the Latin word surrogare, which means \"to put in another's place,\" or \"to substitute.\" An uncle might refer to his niece as a surrogate child if they are very close, especially if he doesn't have his own biological children. Since 1978, surrogate has also been used to describe a woman who carries and delivers a baby for another person or couple."
  },
  "preempt": {
    "short": "If everyone at the lunch meeting is vying for the last roast beef sandwich, but you grab it first, you preempt your colleagues from getting it. Let them eat liverwurst! Preempt means to displace or take something before others can.",
    "long": "Preempt combines the Latin prefix prae-, \"before,\" with emere, \"to buy.\" Think old-fashioned land grabs and midnight madness sales. It can also mean to replace one thing with another that’s more important. For instance, if the president is speaking or the football game is running long, brace yourself: the network just might preempt your favorite show."
  },
  "compel": {
    "short": "Compel means to force or drive someone to do something. Even if you don't like toast, when you visit the toast-eating natives of Shrintakook Island, you'll be compelled to eat it, or they will not trust you.",
    "long": "You don't want to be compelled to go to a classical music concert if you'd rather listen to rap. School officials might be upset if a winter storm compels them to cancel classes, but you'd be okay with that. A compelling mystery forces you to pay attention because you want to find out \"whodunit.\""
  },
  "hone": {
    "short": "The verb hone means to sharpen skills. When you practice shooting baskets every day after school, you are honing your skills as a basketball player.",
    "long": "Hone, the verb, literally means to sharpen with a hone, a whetstone used to sharpen cutting tools. Use hone to describe someone working hard, perfecting or sharpening skills, as in \"She is honing her skills as an actress by working in community theater.\" Hone, which rhymes with phone, is from the Old English word, han, meaning \"stone, rock.\""
  },
  "pristine": {
    "short": "If something is pristine it's immaculately clean or has never been used. So please check your shoes before walking on a pristine white carpet.",
    "long": "A long, long time ago pristine was used to describe primitive or ancient things. It wasn’t until 1899 that the word grew to mean \"unspoiled\" or \"pure.\" Ecologists strive to preserve pristine rain forests, just as vacationers are always looking for a pristine strip of beach to lounge on. A new car should arrive to you in pristine condition, and hopefully you'll do your best to keep it that way."
  },
  "propensity": {
    "short": "A propensity is a natural tendency to behave in a certain way. We all have propensities — things we tend to do. Dogs have a propensity to bark, and many people have a propensity for getting annoyed by it.",
    "long": "If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a propensity to laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to change your propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder."
  },
  "putrefy": {
    "short": "When eggs rot, they putrefy or start to smell really, really bad. Putrefy is to begin stinking, usually when rotting or decomposing.",
    "long": "When you describe something as putrid, it means it is foul or disgusting –– drinking Coke and milk together is gross. Add ketchup, and the cocktail becomes putrid. But technically, putrid, like putrefy, refers to the smell of something organic that has begun to decompose. Open the lid of your garbage can and you will smell the putrefying remains of your meals. Both putrid and putrefy share the Latin root of putr which you can remember by its first two letters — P. U.!"
  },
  "connoisseur": {
    "short": "A connoisseur is a person who, through study and interest, has a fine appreciation for something, like the connoisseur who can identify the clarinet player on a jazz recording by the sound of his inhalations alone.",
    "long": "A connoisseur is an authority in his field, someone who has expert knowledge and training, especially in the arts. A connoisseur may also be someone with an extremely developed sense of taste, like the connoisseur who can identify rare wine by a flavor others can't even detect. Then again, some people call themselves connoisseurs of just about anything they like — pizza, old vinyl albums, even cartoons — because they know so much about it."
  },
  "assimilate": {
    "short": "If you are trying to fit in, you are trying to assimilate.",
    "long": "Imported from Latin, assimilate has the word similar within it and in fact, means \"to become like something else.\" If someone moves to another country, he or she will need to assimilate by adapting to and taking in the language, culture and customs of the new place. You can also turn the phrase around to say that a country assimilates immigrants, which means that a place accepts immigrants and allows them to adapt easily. In scientific use, the body assimilates nutrients as a part of digestion."
  },
  "languish": {
    "short": "To languish is to become pitiful or weak because you're sick, in love, or stuck somewhere. A prisoner might languish in jail, longing for her freedom.",
    "long": "Languish, like languid, is from the Latin word languere which means \"to be weak or faint.\" Your houseplants might languish in a dark dry corner. A Romantic poet might languish on a velvet couch with the back of her hand to her forehead. People in operas love to languish: The main character in La Traviata, Violetta, languishes from longing and eventually tuberculosis."

  "effigy": {
    "short": "In modern usage, effigy most often refers to a likeness, such as a dummy, that is hanged, burned, or otherwise abused when protesting the despised person's actions.",
    "long": "If you've encountered the phrase \"in effigy,” it's probably been in a news report about protesters burning a stuffed figure made to look like a loathed corporate leader or head of state. Since the 18th century or longer, effigies have been destroyed in place of individuals who, as far as the angry crowd is concerned, have escaped justice. Effigy can also refer to a sculptural portrait of the deceased reclining upon a burial monument."
  },
  "fecund": {
    "short": "The adjective fecund describes things that are highly fertile and that easily produce offspring or fruit. Rabbits are often considered to be fecund animals, and you may hear jokes in poor taste about people reproducing like rabbits if they have a lot of children.",
    "long": "The word fecund comes from the Latin word fecundus, meaning fruitful. But the English word does not just describe something or someone fertile, the adjective fecund can also be used to describe someone who is innovative or highly intellectually productive. Your fecund imagination will be an asset if you have to tell ghost stories around the fire at camp while eating s'mores but that same fecund imagination could be less helpful if you're at home alone on a stormy night and you think you hear a knock at the door!"
  },
  "belligerent": {
    "short": "If someone is belligerent, they're eager to fight. It's a good idea to avoid hardcore hockey fans after their team loses — they tend to be belligerent.",
    "long": "Belligerent comes from the Latin word bellum, for \"war.\" You can use it to talk about actual wars — the nations taking part in a war are called belligerents — but usually belligerent describes a psychological disposition. If you're running a school for aggressive boys, do plenty of arts and crafts to prevent them from becoming too belligerent. The stress is on the second syllable: bə-LIJ-ə-rənt."
  },
  "grievous": {
    "short": "If something is called grievous, you better take it seriously. Grievous is used to describe horrible things like tragedies or crimes. If you have a grievous wound, a band aid simply won't do.",
    "long": "Grievous is derived from the noun grief, which means \"sadness.\" When something is grievous, therefore, it's not just bad, but so bad that it causes unusually intense shock or sadness. It's often used to describe crimes and other bad deeds that go beyond mere criminality and into the world of cruelty. For example, it's harmful to steal from someone; it's grievous to steal from them and then, having stolen their stuff, beat them up or kill them."
  },
  "torpor": {
    "short": "Torpor is a state of mental and physical inactivity. \"After a huge Thanksgiving meal, my family members fall into a torpor; no one can even pick up the TV remote.\"",
    "long": "Torpor can be used in everyday speech, but it's also a scientific term for a state of deep sleep that allows animals to conserve energy. Certain species of bats, birds, and frogs rely on torpor for survival during tough times. While humans don't technically belong to this group of animals, they certainly appear to, especially after a large meal and on most Monday mornings."
  },
  "ebb": {
    "short": "When something ebbs, it is declining, falling, or flowing away. The best time to look for sea creatures in tidal pools is when the tide is on the ebb — meaning it has receded from the shore.",
    "long": "Ebb is often used in the phrase, \"ebb and flow,\" referring to the cyclical changing of the tides from low to high and back to low again.

    "short": "If you are sad and can't be cheered up, you're disconsolate.  Why were you disconsolate after scoring a touchdown?  Oh...it was for the other team.",
    "long": "In addition to meaning \"inconsolable,\" the adjective disconsolate can also mean \"dejected.\"  Most people would be disconsolate after being laid off from a job, losing a beloved pet, or missing out on tickets to see a favorite band play live. This word ultimately derives from the Latin verb consolari, meaning \"to cheer (someone) up or offer comfort to.\""
  },
  "malefactor": {
    "short": "A malefactor has done something illegal and has been or will be convicted, such as the malefactor who was videotaped stealing money from a cash register.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce malefactor, remember that the first syllable, mal rhymes with pal. A malefactor, however, is no friend you should have. Mal- comes from Latin and means \"bad, evil,\" and facere means \"to perform.\" A malefactor performs evil acts, or to put it a little less dramatically, does really bad things."

  "detection": {
    "short": "Detection is the act of noticing or discovering something. At the airport, you might see German Shepherds trained in the detection of drug smuggling or explosives in luggage.",
    "long": "Detection, detect, detective, detector — all are about noticing and discovering. A detective looks for clues that lead to the detection of the person who committed a crime.

  "illiterate": {
    "short": "You can describe a person unable to read or write as illiterate. Karaoke, which involves singing out the words to songs as they scroll across a big screen, requires the ability to read. If you’re illiterate, you won’t be able to participate.",
    "long": "Illiterate, from the Latin illiteratus “unlearned, ignorant,” can describe someone unable to read or write, but it can also imply that a person lacks cultural awareness. However, Walt Whitman saw a unique beauty to illiteracy: “There is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius.”"

This kind of book first became popular in Spain in the 1500s. Well known authors, including Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, later used a picaresque style for some of their work.

You might also include examples. Intelligible comes from the Latin word intelligibilis, \"that can understand or that which can be understood.\" The earlier meaning of intelligible was \"able to understand,\" which today is closer to the meaning of intelligent."

    "short": "Primary means basically \"first.\" When you vote in a primary, that is the first election in a series. When a matter is of primary concern, it means it's of first importance. Primary school is the first you go to (after nursery school, at least).",
    "long": "There's an interesting alternate system for counting first, second, third, etc. up to tenth. It's primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, quinary, senary, septenary, octonary, nonary, and denary. There's also a word for twelfth, duodenary, though that — along with all the words after tertiary — is rarely used."
  },
  "insurgent": {
    "short": "An insurgent is a rebel or a revolutionary, someone who takes up arms against the authorities.",
    "long": "Insurgent is from the Latin word “insurgentem,” literally meaning “to rise against,” so think of an insurgent as a fighter who rises against the people in power. Often insurgents are considered terrorists because they use violence to intimidate people."
  },
  "primitive": {
    "short": "When we talk about \"primitive man\", we're usually talking about cavemen and other people who existed before the advent of table manners, but if your uncle speaks grunts and chews with his mouth open, you could describe him as primitive too.",
    "long": "Primitive is related to the word prime, and the root of both words is primus, which is Latin for \"first.\" Since the phrase \"primitive man\" refers to the world's first people, you might think that the word primate has something to do with the similarity between early humans and monkeys, but it doesn't.  Monkey, apes, and humans are called primates because they're seen as standing on the first, or highest, rung of the animal-kingdom ladder."
  },
  "martial": {
    "short": "An adjective referring to the military, the word martial adds a warlike tone to any noun it describes.",
    "long": "The word martial derives from Mars, the Roman god of war. It refers to almost much anything military, including \"martial law,\" in which the government orders the military to administer the law. The word definitely makes one think of fighting, as in the physical discipline known as the martial arts. But there is a lighter side to the word, too. Martial music, usually associated with the military, is usually bright and inspiring."
  },
  "seminar": {
    "short": "A seminar means a class or meeting, but it carries with it extra weight.  An educational  seminar indicates a small, advanced study, while a meeting labeled as such means an intense exchange of ideas.",
    "long": "The Latin seminarium originally referred to a plant nursery, a place of great growth. From this came the German seminar, referring to a formal educational group led by a professor.  While university seminars are most frequently small-group studies of a particular issue, the word is also applied to large lectures and commercial pitches. Like the seminar you attended on how to get rich by selling carrot peelers to your neighbors."
  },
  "appease": {
    "short": "Appease means to make or preserve peace with a nation, group, or person by giving in to their demands, or to relieve a problem, as in \"the cold drink appeased his thirst.\"",
    "long": "Appease often implies abandoning your moral principles to satisfy the demands of someone who is greedy for power: think of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's attempt to appease the Nazis at Munich. The verb appease comes from the Old French apaisier, \"to pacify, make peace, or be reconciled,\" from the phrase \"a paisier,\" which combines a-, or \"to,\" and pais, \"peace,\" from the Latin pax."
  },
  "impulsive": {
    "short": "If someone is impulsive, it means that they act on instinct, without thinking decisions through. If you worked for an entire year to save money for a car and then suddenly decided to spend it all on a diamond tiara instead, that would be an impulsive purchase.",
    "long": "Impulses are short, quick feelings, and if someone is in the habit of acting on them, they're impulsive. When stores stock chocolate at the checkout line, they are hoping you will impulsively decide to buy it. When you call the person you have a crush on after promising yourself all day to maintain an air of dignified reserve, that's impulsive behavior. We might also call impulsive behavior whimsical or capricious."
  },
  "inquisitive": {
    "short": "If you are inquisitive that means you love to inquire; you’re always asking questions. Don’t become a private detective if you don’t have an inquisitive personality.",
    "long": "The old word for question is query, which you can hear in inquire, which means to ask questions. That toddler always asking “why?” is going through an inquisitive stage of development. If someone   throws relentlessly hard questions at us, we might call it an inquisition. If your daughter brings her boyfriend home to dinner, be gently inquisitive, but try not to turn it into an inquisition. You'll just make him nervous."
  },
  "paucity": {
    "short": "The word paucity means not enough of something. If you've got a paucity of good cheer, for example, you'd better cheer up!",
    "long": "One good way to remember the meaning of paucity is that it's a bit like pauper, as in The Prince and the Pauper. The prince had too much money, and the pauper had a paucity. There are a lot of words that mean \"little\" or \"small,\" but paucity is used when you mean specifically \"not enough\" or \"too little.\" People in Los Angeles don't understand how New Yorkers can live with such a paucity of space. For what New Yorkers pay for a tiny apartment, Angelenos get a house and a yard."
  },
  "falter": {
    "short": "Falter means to hesitate, stumble, or waver, and everything from faith to voices can do it. So if you want to keep your bride or groom happy, it's best not to falter when it's your turn to say \"I do.\"",
    "long": "Experts may falter if you ask them where falter came from, because the origins are pretty unclear. But everyone agrees on the current meaning: someone who falters is unsteady, wobbly, or unsure. You might falter while reciting a poem if you forget some of the lines, or falter crossing a rickety rope bridge when fear gets the most of you. But you certainly won't falter when someone asks you the meaning of this word."
  },
  "protagonist": {
    "short": "A protagonist is the central character in a story: the protagonist of Huckleberry Finn is — guess who? — Huckleberry Finn.",
    "long": "A novel, movie, or play might have many main characters, but it can really only have one protagonist — or maybe two in the case of, say, Romeo and Juliet. That's because protos means \"first\" in Greek, and agonistes means \"competitor\" or \"actor.\" It can also mean a leading figure in a real-life situation: \"Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were the protagonists of the U.S. Civil War.\" Don't use it to mean \"a supporter of an idea or cause\"; the word you're looking for in that situation is proponent."
  },
  "comprehensive": {
    "short": "When you want to describe something that includes all or most details, you can use the adjective comprehensive. If you get the comprehensive treatment at a spa, it might include massage, manicure and a facial.",
    "long": "Comprehensive is from Latin comprehensivus, from comprehensus, the source of English comprehend. In business, comprehensive insurance is insurance that covers a broad range, offering protection against most risks of a certain type. It applies mainly to car insurance."
  },
  "mercenary": {
    "short": "You might not want to call a mercenary a \"hireling\" to his face, but a mercenary is, after all, a soldier who gets paid to fight where needed, sometimes taking a heroic stand and other times just wanting payment for fighting.",
    "long": "The word mercenary comes from the Latin mercēnārius, \"hireling,\" which defines someone who will do anything in exchange for money. In history, a mercenary was often a fighter who followed the next paycheck, but in recent decades it's also been used for fighters who pursue a good cause in areas where soldiers are in short supply. A synonym for mercenary is \"soldier of fortune,\" and this phrase sometimes glorifies the mercenary, turning the meaning of \"fortune\" from \"cash\" to \"luck in battle.\""
  },
  "salient": {
    "short": "If something stands out in a very obvious way, it can be called salient. It's time to find new friends if the differences between you and your current friends are becoming more and more salient.",
    "long": "Salient, from the Latin verb salire \"to leap,\" was originally used in English to refer to leaping animals such as a frog or deer and may still be used this way. Often, however, it is used in math or geography to mean protruding. A salient angle juts outward rather than inward. Figuratively, it means noticeable or prominent. When giving an argument, make your most salient points at the beginning or the end."
  },
  "obligatory": {
    "short": "Obligatory describes something you do because you have to, not because you want to. When you buy a car, you have to fill out the obligatory forms. In many homes, saying please and thank you is obligatory.",
    "long": "Obligatory derives from the verb oblige, as in \"after she was so nice, I felt obliged to take her a present.\" Some people feel burdened by lives of common obligation, giving presents, returning phone calls, eating birthday cake, attending religious services––none of which they feel any real desire to do."
  },
  "contain": {
    "short": "The verb contain has many shades of meaning but it often describes something that's held back or held in by something. Kids on the last day of school may find it hard to contain their glee when summer officially starts.",
    "long": "Picture Times Square on New Year's Eve. People can barely contain — or hold back — their excitement at being there. They clutch cups that contain — or hold — hot drinks that help them stay warm. The police set up barriers to contain — or restrain — the crowd to keep everyone under control. The next morning, the heaps of trash on the street will contain — or include — streamers, party hats, and cups."
  },
  "minutes": {
    "short": "Minutes are notes that are taken at a meeting and often distributed to participants. Often, the secretary of an organization or club is the person who gets stuck taking the minutes.",
    "long": "The best minutes provide a summary of the most important items that were discussed during a meeting. Parent-teacher organizations, city councils, and court hearings all include someone who takes minutes. In the case of a hearing, every single word spoken in the courtroom, unless specifically excluded by the judge, is included in the minutes. The Latin root of minutes is minuta scriptura, \"rough notes,\" or \"small writing.\""
  },
  "accretion": {
    "short": "The process of increasing can be called accretion. Although you may say that stalactites \"grow\" from the ceilings of caves, they actually form from an accretion of limestone and other minerals.",
    "long": "So what's the difference between an addition and an accretion? Addition implies adding to something that already exists, such as an addition to the cast (when a new actor joins an existing show). The noun accretion, on the other hand, implies an accumulation that causes increase, such as \"an accretion of frost on the windows\" or \"an accretion of plaque on your teeth.\" The latter, of course, is why the dentist always begs you to floss and brush."
  },
  "downplay": {
    "short": "To downplay something is to act as if it's not very important. If you're trying to convince your friends to play poker with you, you might downplay the fact that you're an experienced and competitive player.",
    "long": "Politicians who depend on contributions from oil and gas companies tend to downplay the environmental effects of their products, and a boy who wants a trampoline for his birthday might downplay the possible dangers when he talks to his parents about it. Downplay is a relatively recent addition to the English language, dating from the late 1960s."
  },
  "diligent": {
    "short": "Someone who is diligent works hard and carefully. If you want to write the epic history of your family, you'll have to be very diligent in tracking down and interviewing all of your relatives.",
    "long": "Diligent comes from the Latin diligere, which means \"to value highly, take delight in,\" but in English it has always meant careful and hard-working. If you're a diligent worker, you don't just bang away at your job; you earnestly try to do everything right. Although being lucky and talented doesn't hurt, it's the diligent person who eventually succeeds."
  },
  "vindicate": {
    "short": "Vindicate means to justify, prove, or reinforce an idea — or to absolve from guilt. If your family thinks you hogged the last piece of pie on Thanksgiving, you'll be vindicated when your younger brother fesses up.",
    "long": "Vindicate derives from the Latin vindicatus, which is the past tense of vindicare, meaning \"lay claim to\" or \"avenge.\" When a physicist proves a theory that his colleagues derided, he vindicates it. When a lawyer clears her client's name in a trial, she vindicates him. Machiavelli argued that the results he got vindicated his tactics — in other words, the ends justified the means."
  },
  "chagrined": {
    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "nostalgia": {
    "short": "Think of the noun nostalgia when you long for the good old days of the past.",
    "long": "The noun nostalgia was invented by a Swiss doctor in the late 1600s. He put together the Greek nostos \"homecoming\" and algos \"pain, distress\" as a literal translation of the German Heimweh \"homesickness.\" Originally, it was a medical diagnosis for mercenary soldiers. Today, it describes a bittersweet longing for the past. Think of the dreamy way your grandpa tells stories of his childhood — he's got nostalgia."
  },
  "abdicate": {
    "short": "Sometimes someone in power might decide to give up that power and step down from his or her position. When they do that, they abdicate their authority, giving up all duties and perks of the job.",
    "long": "The original meaning of the verb abdicate came from the combination of the Latin ab- \"away\" and dicare \"proclaim.\" (Note that in the charming relationships between languages with common roots, the Spanish word for \"he says\" is dice, which comes directly from dicare.) The word came to refer to disowning one's children, and it wasn't until the 17th century that the first use of the word relating to giving up power or public office was recorded."
  },
  "malapropism": {
    "short": "A malapropism occurs when you say one word but you mean another, like instead of saying a certain restaurant is prosperous, you say it is preposterous. As you can tell, malapropisms are often humorous, though sometimes the joke is on the speaker.",
    "long": "The word malapropism, pronounced \"mah-luh-PRAH-pih-zum,\" comes from the French phrase mal à propos, which means \"ill-suited.\" Playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan must have been thinking of the French phrase when he created his character Mrs. Malaprop, who made audiences howl with laughter when she used the wrong word. Examples include saying \"allegory\" instead of \"alligator,\" and \"illiterate him from your memory\" instead of \"obliterate.\""
  },
  "bereft": {
    "short": "So, they took the thing you most loved, and you're never going to get it back. You've gone beyond just plain grief-stricken — you're bereft.",
    "long": "The way in which bereft differs just from plain mournful or grief-stricken is in its sense of deprivation or lack. It can be used that way too, for example when you're bereft of words. It's the past tense of bereave, following the same pattern as leave and left. When you see your bereft relatives at a funeral, it's very sad, but if your friend says that their cookie is bereft of chocolate chips, you know they are using exaggerated language to be a little funny."
  },
  "drone": {
    "short": "To drone is to make a low, continuous noise that sounds like humming or buzzing. On summer nights, you might hear cicadas drone, and on snowy winter mornings, hear your neighbor's snow blower drone.",
    "long": "Like animals and machines, people drone too, their voices sounding dull and tedious: \"When my history teacher drones on, it's hard to stay awake.\" Drone is also a noun, meaning the monotonous sound itself, like the drone of a boring lecture; or a male worker bee; or a person who's as unambitious as a worker bee. Finally, there are the drones that fly by remote control, doing surveillance, gathering weather information, and occasionally firing missiles for the military."
  },
  "subservient": {
    "short": "Subservient means \"compliant,\" \"obedient,\" \"submissive,\" or having the qualities of a servant. Something that's subservient has been made useful, or put into the service of, something else.",
    "long": "Our word subservient is unusual because it actually comes from the Latin word of exactly the same spelling and almost the identical meaning — \"subjecting to\" or \"complying with.\" Usually words change a little in spelling or meaning when they are adopted from another language, but this one did not. Maybe the word subservient seemed so subservient that it could comply with the rules of any language!"
  },
  "evade": {
    "short": "When you evade something, you escape it. You could evade a police chase by slipping into a secret alley, or you could evade your mother's questions about the missing cookies by slipping into another topic.",
    "long": "Other things people like to evade? Death. Taxes. Creepy ex-boyfriends. The verb evade comes from Latin roots ex (\"away) and vadere (\"to walk\"), meaning literally \"to walk away or to escape.\" Definitely what you want to do with creepy ex-boyfriends."
  },
  "intemperance": {
    "short": "Intemperance is when you can't do anything half way, or hold yourself back. You might describe your inability to eat a single slice of cake — instead, gobbling the whole thing — as intemperance.",
    "long": "When someone isn't able to temper — or moderate — his actions, he is at risk of intemperance. Your uncle shows intemperance when he yells furiously at everyone around him every time he feels angry, and your sister's intemperance might come out in her terrible shopping habit. The opposite of intemperance is moderation. The Latin root word, intemperantia, means \"immoderation or excess,\" and was originally used in English to describe the weather."
  },
  "parenthetical": {
    "short": "A parenthetical statement is one that explains or qualifies something. You can call such a statement a parenthetical, (especially when it's in parentheses).",
    "long": "Have you ever said something like \"I'm hungry!\" and then added \"...but I only want French fries\"? That second statement is parenthetical: it clarifies the first statement. Just like words in parentheses (like these words) add clarity to a sentence, parenthetical words in speech help make something clearer or give extra information. You can call these statements (or words that actually are inside parentheses) parentheticals; and while parentheticals aren't the most important ideas, they help support those ideas."
  },
  "grating": {
    "short": "When something is grating, it's extremely harsh and irritating, like the grating sound of your alarm clock early on a Monday morning.",
    "long": "As an adjective, grating is particularly good for describing unpleasant sounds, like the grating voice of someone who's nagging you. As a noun, a grating is an object in the shape of a grid, with parallel bars forming regular squares or rectangles. This kind of grating is often used as a cover for an opening, like the grating that covers a storm drain in the gutter or an exhaust fan in the ceiling."
  },
  "inequitable": {
    "short": "If something is inequitable, it's not not fair or just. If one math class gets a pizza party and another gets an algebra quiz, that's inequitable.",
    "long": "The word inequitable is a fancy way to say \"unfair.\" It adds the prefix in-, or \"not,\" to equitable, \"fair and impartial.\" In law, inequitable conduct has to do with lying or withholding information during the process of suing someone. In more ordinary circumstances, if your brother complains that his half of the cookie you split is smaller, you can shrug and tell him, \"Sometimes life is inequitable.\""
  },
  "perfunctory": {
    "short": "Perfunctory means done as part of a routine or duty. If you give someone a gift and they look at it like it's roadkill and say nothing but a perfunctory \"thank you,\" you might not be giving them another one anytime soon.",
    "long": "A person who does something in a perfunctory way shows little enthusiasm or interest in what they are doing. Many of our everyday greetings are perfunctory. For example, when we say \"Hello\" and \"How are you?\", we usually do so out of habit. Perfunctory is from Latin perfunctus, from perfungi, \"to get through with, perform,\" formed from the Latin prefix per-, \"completely,\" plus fungi, \"to perform.\""
  },
  "mystery": {
    "short": "A mystery is something that baffles our understanding and cannot be explained. The giant slabs of Stonehenge, remain a mystery to this day.",
    "long": "The noun mystery comes from the Greek mysterion, meaning \"secret rite or doctrine.\" A great synonym for secret is enigma. We use this word all the time to describe stuff we don't understand, from crop circles and UFOs to the origins of the universe and the workings of the human brain. In literature, drama, and film, a mystery is a story that centers around a crime, usually murder, which finally gets solved at the very end."
  },
  "imperial": {
    "short": "Imperial carries the implication of royalty, usually pertaining to an empire; the emperor or empress is referred to as \"your imperial highness.\"",
    "long": "The word imperial has a lofty feel, and though it's often used of royalty, it is sometimes used to refer to anything extremely large or impressive. It was once the name of a large suitcase that was too big to fit inside a coach and so was tied on top. Think of something imperial as being something so upper-class that it's almost to the point of royalty — and sometimes almost to the point of being a joke."
  },
  "heresy": {
    "short": "A heresy is a belief that doesn't agree with the official tenets of a particular religion; heresy is the maintaining of such contrary beliefs.",
    "long": "Heresy can be used figuratively: to disagree with the school committee's decisions is considered pure heresy by the faculty. You'll often come across this word in a religious context — the Latin root haeresis, \"school of thought or sect,\" was used by Christian writers to mean \"unorthodox sect or belief.\" This comes from the Greek hairesis, \"a taking or choosing,\" from hairein, \"to choose.\" A person who chooses to believe in heresies is called a heretic."
  },
  "scintilla": {
    "short": "It might take more than a scintilla of English vocabulary knowledge to know that scintilla means a tiny bit of something.",
    "long": "Scintilla is a long word for describing a tiny thing. It comes sandwiched between the words a and of in phrases like “a scintilla of doubt” or “not a single scintilla of evidence.” If you’re uncertain of the pronunciation, remember: it rhymes with chinchilla and the c is silent, just like in science. Similar words you can use to talk about tiny bits of something are iota, smidgen, speck, and whit."
  },
  "doff": {
    "short": "Use the verb doff to describe removing something. You probably always doff your cap before the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"",
    "long": "The word doff and its antonym don date to the mid-14th century. Doff is a contraction of \"do (take) off,\" and don is short for \"do (put) on.\" By 1755, these words were all but obsolete, but they came back into vogue thanks to Sir Walter Scott, author of works like Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, and The Lady of the Lake. The popular Scottish author used them frequently, and he and his readers kept doff and don alive."
  },
  "gavel": {
    "short": "You know that wooden hammer a judge slams down on his desk when he's trying to bring order to the court? That's a gavel.",
    "long": "Judges aren't the only ones who use gavels. They are common in governments large and small, where they are used to bring order to the often unruly rooms where government happens. But they are also a sign of who's in charge. The practice of turning control from one party, or one person, to another, is done by \"passing the gavel.\" It's a big deal when the outgoing Speaker of the House of Representatives turns over the gavel  to the incoming Speaker. Sometimes it looks like the hand-off won't happen — a gavel being the ultimate sign of authority and power."
  },
  "idolatry": {
    "short": "Idolatry means the worship of images as if they were gods. Many religions prohibit idolatry, some even to the extent of forbidding any representational objects in houses of worship.",
    "long": "Idol sits at the head of the word idolatry. If you worship — or even just look up to — a person or a thing, you are said to idolize them. For some modern idolaters, money is their idol, while for others it is celebrities, and for still others their jobs."
  },
  "missive": {
    "short": "A missive usually refers to the old-school style of hand-written communication on paper (remember that?), but these days you also might hear an email called a missive. No matter how you deliver it, a missive is a message.",
    "long": "The noun missive comes from the Latin word missus, meaning \"to send.\"  You may have heard the phrase, \"fire off a missive,\" meaning a note, memo or dispatch that was written and sent with urgency and conveyed an important message. It might have been a missive sent from a commander to the troops, telling them of a change in the battle plan. Or, maybe it was an urgent love letter to the commander's wife back home, telling her to tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree..."
  },
  "unprecedented": {
    "short": "Something that is unprecedented is not known, experienced, or done before. If you've never gone on a family beach vacation but you're planning one now, you could refer to it as an unprecedented decision.",
    "long": "The root of this word is precedent, a noun referring to something done or said that is used as an example to be followed in the future. In law, a precedent is a legal decision that is used as a standard in future cases. So the adjective unprecedented, meaning \"having no precedent,\" was formed from the prefix un- \"not,\" the noun precedent, and the suffix –ed \"having.\""
  },
  "platitude": {
    "short": "If an executive gives a speech that begins, \"This business is all about survival of the fittest. You need to burn the midnight oil and take one for the team,\" his employees might get sick of listening to these meaningless clichés and tell him to cut the platitudes.",
    "long": "The English language contains many old, worn-out clichés, or platitudes. Phrases like \"ants in your pants\" and \"as American as apple pie\" are so overused that they've almost lost their meaning. People rely on these tired old remarks when they can't think of anything original to say. Be warned: if you throw too many platitudes into your conversations, people are eventually going to get tired of listening to you."
  },
  "gossamer": {
    "short": "Gossamer is something super fine and delicate — like a spider web or the material of a wedding veil.",
    "long": "The original gossamer, from which these meanings come from, is the fine, filmy substance spiders excrete to weave their webs. A dress can be gossamer-like, if its fabric is so sheer as to be see-through, or almost. Your chances of going to a good college are \"gossamer thin\" if you've never cracked a book in high school."
  },
  "wary": {
    "short": "Describe yourself as wary if you don't quite trust someone or something and want to proceed with caution. Be wary of risky things like wild mushrooms and Internet deals!",
    "long": "You can trace wary through Old English back to Old High German giwar \"aware, attentive.\" If you keep a wary eye on something, you are attentive for signs that it is becoming dangerous. Likewise, if you give someone a wary glance, your face conveys the suspicion and caution you feel. When you are wary of driving alone at night or making promises, you fear something bad might happen if you do these things."
  },
  "flustered": {
    "short": "To be flustered is to lose your cool. When you're flustered, you're embarrassed, agitated, or just confused.",
    "long": "If your pants fell down in the middle of class while you were giving a presentation, you'd probably be flustered: highly embarrassed, out of breath, and a little freaked out. It's hard to concentrate when you're flustered — it's a distracting state of mind. Being flustered isn't quite as bad as being panicked, but it's close. People can also get flustered by good things, like if someone you had a crush on kissed you."
  },
  "glean": {
    "short": "Glean means to gather bit by bit, either literally or figuratively. You might glean leftover grain from a recently harvested field or glean information about new vocabulary words by hearing them used in context.",
    "long": "When you glean information, you sort through ideas and take what you need. Seeing a word in context lets you glean information about how it's used, for example. If you want to find treasures at a thrift shop, you’ll have to glean the good stuff out of the piles of junk. To glean a field means to walk along and see what’s left on the ground. It takes patience to glean."
  },
  "fugitive": {
    "short": "Someone who flees or runs away from the police to avoid capture is a fugitive. \"Authorities were looking for three men who escaped from prison today. Authorities believe the three fugitives may be disguised as nuns and advise the public to be careful.\"",
    "long": "Although a fugitive can specifically be someone fleeing from the police, the noun can also refer to anyone who is fleeing from an untenable situation. \"The family asked for asylum in the United States because they were fugitives from their own oppressive government.\" As an adjective, the word can mean \"fleeing or fleeting.\" \"Many people helped the fugitive slaves to safety.\" \"At night, he was plagued with fugitive thoughts: they seemed important when he woke from sleep, but by morning he had forgotten them.\""

  "voluble": {
    "short": "Voluble describes someone who talks a lot, like your aunt who can’t stop telling you to cut your hair or a political candidate who makes twenty speeches on the day before the election.",
    "long": "Have you ever found it especially hard to interrupt someone who talks a lot when he or she gets on a roll? If so, it won’t surprise you that the adjective voluble traces back to the Latin word volvere, meaning “to roll.” The word voluble describes talking continuously, fluently, at great length, in a steady flow. You’ll know it when you meet voluble talkers: they just keep rolling on and on."

  "bastion": {
    "short": "When the battle is getting long and the odds are getting longer, retreat to your bastion to regroup and prepare for the next round of fighting. A bastion is a stronghold or fortification that remains intact.",
    "long": "French Independence Day, or Bastille Day (July 14), commemorates the storming in 1789 of the French king's prison/fort, the Bastille. Bastion and Bastille share the root bast, which means \"build.\" Bastion can refer to any place to which one turns for safety; that can include not only buildings but also concepts, ideas, and even beliefs. The Church, for example, is a bastion of many religious beliefs."

  "strut": {
    "short": "When you strut, you walk with a proud swagger that has a little arrogance thrown in, like the prance of a running back who has just flown past the 250-pound linebackers and planted the ball in the end zone.",
    "long": "You can't strut and be shy about it — when you strut, you know people are watching you. The big boss in a gangster film, a model on the runway, and the rap artist whose album has just gone platinum all know how to strut. The noun form of strut has a little less flash and refers to a vertical or horizontal support that holds something up, like the long steel bars holding up a building."
  },
  "vacant": {
    "short": "You can use the adjective vacant to describe something that is empty — an apartment with no tenant or furniture, a job with no worker, or a person with no brainpower.",
    "long": "Vacant has its roots in the Latin word meaning “empty” or “free.” It can mean “unoccupied,” such as that seat next to you on the train — even if you’ve put your coat there. A vacant look or stare, however, is one that shows no intelligence or the slightest spark of interest. One might find this vacant gaze in the eyes of a zombie or in the eyes of a teen who has spent the past five hours gaming."
  },
  "adjourn": {
    "short": "To adjourn is to close a session of something, like at court. People also adjourn when they go to bed.",
    "long": "When something is adjourned, it's over. This word comes up most often in court. Lawyers and citizens don't have the power to adjourn — to call a recess in the proceedings. Only a judge can adjourn the court. This can also be used in any situation where someone is withdrawing from somewhere, or retiring for awhile. \"I must adjourn!\" is a fancy way of saying \"I'm out of here! I need to get some sleep. See you tomorrow.\""
  },
  "indignation": {
    "short": "Call your anger at an unjust situation indignation. If recess gets canceled for everyone because two students get into a fight, the rest of the student body will respond with indignation.",
    "long": "Indignation traces back to the Latin prefix in- \"not\" and root dignus \"worthy\" and means anger at something that is unfair or unjust. Another word for indignation is outrage. Be careful using these words as they have a bit of a negative slant. A person who feels indignation is a little self-righteous and focused on not being treated the way he feels he should be."
  },
  "revitalize": {
    "short": "To revitalize is to restore something to life or give it new life. Revitalizing adds newsness and strength.",
    "long": "Since vital things are alive, strong, and flourishing, when something gets revitalized, it is returned to health or life. A good night's sleep will revitalize you — so will eating a healthy meal. If a rundown building is purchased and then spiffed up, it's being revitalized. A new paint job could revitalize a room. A sick person is revitalized by medicine. In all cases, when something is revitalized, it has been restored to a better state."
  },
  "edifice": {
    "short": "Edifice means a building, but it doesn't mean just any building. To merit being called an edifice, a building must be important. A small but elegant temple can be an edifice, and so can a towering sky scraper.",
    "long": "The meaning of edifice has expanded to include a system of ideas — when it is complicated enough to be considered to have walls and a roof, then it is an edifice. You could say that basic facts of addition and subtraction are the foundation on which the edifice of higher math rests."
  },
  "factual": {
    "short": "If something is factual, it can be proven, like your mother's story about the bear that is factual because she took a picture of it standing next to the family car.",
    "long": "Something factual is real. It is based in fact, meaning it can be proven, repeated or observed. In fact, fact is the root of the word factual, from the Latin word factum, meaning \"event, occurrence.\" The factual part of a story is the part that really happened — the rest gets more outlandish every time someone tells it. Evidence makes something factual."
  },
  "cynosure": {
    "short": "A cynosure is the main attraction. A figure skater on the ice is the cynosure, or focal point, of a stadium as she triple-axels through the air. All eyes are on her with admiration, hoping that she'll land it.",
    "long": "Cynosure, pronounced sy-na-shoor, comes from the Greek word kynosoura, or \"dog's tail.\" In Latin Cynosura refers to the constellation Ursa Minor, also known as the North Star. Unlike other stars, the North Star is a fixed point, used by sailors to orient themselves for centuries. Like a bride who attracts the attention of everyone at a wedding as she comes down the aisle, the North Star is the cynosure for travelers lost in the forest without a map."
  },
  "repugnant": {
    "short": "Repugnant refers to something you detest so thoroughly it threatens to make you physically sick, like the idea of marrying your sister. Or wearing last year's jeans.",
    "long": "A repugnant thing is a thing offensive, detestable, or obscene. It can be repugnant to your mind or your morals. It can also be physically repugnant, like the smell that comes from a restaurant’s dumpster, which hasn't been emptied since the very exciting \"Omelet Week,\" way back at the beginning of August. Makes you want to \"re-PLUG-nant\" your nose!"
  },
  "paradigm": {
    "short": "A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something.",
    "long": "The word paradigm comes up a lot in the academic, scientific, and business worlds. A new paradigm in business could mean a new way of reaching customers and making money. In education, relying on lectures is a paradigm: if you suddenly shifted to all group work, that would be a new paradigm. When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something."
  },
  "qualify": {
    "short": "Make sure you know the context when using the word qualify. In one sense, it means to be right for, to measure up. In another sense, though, qualify means to change something slightly, to limit it or add a condition to it.",
    "long": "If you want to qualify for your driver's license, remember not to drive through that final stop sign without stopping. I guarantee you that if you don't stop you will not qualify. You don't just get your Eagle Badge. You have to qualify for it—there's a lot to do before you get it. The word might be used in its other sense like this: If you plan to get married, keep your vows simple: say \"I do.\" Don't qualify them by saying something like \"I do...except sometimes, when I don't.\" If you have to qualify your wedding vows, don't get married."
  },
  "chicanery": {
    "short": "Have you ever gotten the sense that politicians or corporate leaders will say anything to turn public opinion their way? This tricky kind of deceit and manipulation is called chicanery.",
    "long": "Besides chicanery, another funny-sounding word for trickery is shenanigans. Whereas the former is always used in the singular and involves deceptive language, the latter is usually used in the plural and refers to the actions of a person. Your crazy neighbor is up to his old shenanigans if he has begun doing weird stuff again, but if a politician's chicanery is exposed, he will lose public trust and not be returned to office in the next election cycle."
  },
  "innocuous": {
    "short": "Something that's innocuous isn't harmful or likely to cause injury. Public figures like mayors and governors have to expect they'll get critical or even hurtful emails and phone calls, as well as more innocuous feedback.",
    "long": "The adjective innocuous is useful when you're talking about something that doesn't offend or injure anyone. Innocuous remarks or comments are meant kindly, and innocuous germs won't make you sick. An innocuous question is innocently curious, rather than aimed to hurt someone's feelings. The word comes from the Latin roots in-, \"not,\" and nocere, \"to injure or harm.\""
  },
  "impenetrable": {
    "short": "Impenetrable describes something that's impossible to get through. Whether it's a brick wall or a difficult reading passage, something impenetrable won't let you in.",
    "long": "Impenetrable comes from the Latin impenetrabilis, meaning \"not to put or get into, enter into.\" Impenetrable, the adjective, has two meanings. When you're trying to learn a subject that is so complicated, so confusing or so detailed that it seems like it's in another language or from another planet, it's impenetrable — like calculus. Or a physical object can be impenetrable, meaning it is impossible to actually enter or get inside of, like that impenetrable nightclub that has bouncers watching every entrance to keep you and your friends out."
  },
  "decorous": {
    "short": "Something that is decorous is dignified, proper, and in good taste, like your decorous great-aunt who always wears a dress — even when she's only headed to the grocery store.",
    "long": "The adjective decorous shares its origins with decoration. Both words come from the Latin word decor, meaning \"beauty, elegance, charm, grace, ornament.\" So, something decorous is attractive. Decorous can also mean \"dignified or proper,\" like your decorous habit of saying, \"How do you do?\" when you meet someone for the first time."
  },
  "agenda": {
    "short": "An agenda is a list of things to do. If you're going to attend a meeting with a long agenda, you'll want to take your coffee mug along.",
    "long": "The word agenda is the plural for of the Latin word agendum, which literally means \"something to be done.\" The noun retains this meaning  because an agenda is a plan — organized by time — of events or things to do. You might have a meeting, a lunch date, and a doctor's appointment on your agenda for the day. And when you run for office, you better have a political agenda — or a plan for what you want to get done if elected."
  },
  "opiate": {
    "short": "An opiate is a drug such as morphine or heroin that is derived from opium. Used figuratively, it means something that calms or soothes.",
    "long": "Karl Marx famously said that religion was the opiate of the masses, which means he thought that it was religion that prevented working-class people from rising up against their leaders. Today, you might say that television has replaced religion as a mass opiate, but you'd need to say that during a commercial for anyone to pay much attention."
  },
  "intermittent": {
    "short": "Reach for the adjective intermittent to describe periodic movement and stopping and starting over a period of time.",
    "long": "The adjective intermittent modifies things that work or stop and start at periodic intervals. An interesting use of something intermittent is a metronome, a device that marks off time in music by making a sound in a regular pattern. It provides structure for musicians, especially when there are several instruments all playing different melodies at the same time. Other intermittent things are the windshield wipers on your car — and thank goodness for them when it rains!"
  },
  "abundant": {
    "short": "On Halloween, you can find candy in abundant supply. Use abundant to describe something that exists in large amounts that are more than what's needed.",
    "long": "Near synonyms are plentiful, emphasizing \"large amounts,\" and ample, emphasizing \"more than enough.\" The adjective abundant is commonly followed by the prepositions with or in, to mean \"filled with or rich in something\": a region abundant in natural resources. Abundant comes from Middle English aboundant, from Old French abondant, from Latin abundāns, form of abundāre \"to overflow.\""
  },
  "rationale": {
    "short": "The rationale for something is the basic or underlying reason or explanation for it. This noun (pronounced \"rash-uh-NAL\") is usually used in the singular: What was the rationale behind his decision to quit?",
    "long": "The related adjective rational means \"based on facts or reason\" or \"having the ability to think clearly.\" An example of a rational rationale? You add extra baking soda to pancake batter under the rationale that if you want them to be fluffier, you need more rising agent. Rationale is from Latin, from rationalis \"relating to reason,\" from ratio \"calculation, reason,\" from rērī \"to consider, think.\""
  },
  "exemplar": {
    "short": "A high school valedictorian is an exemplar of dedication and hard work. Most parents would love for their children to emulate a student with such excellent grades.",
    "long": "Notice the similarity between the words exemplar and example. This word can mean both “perfect example” and “typical example.” A fireman can be an exemplar of courage, and a building can be an exemplar of the architecture from a certain period."
  },
  "cursory": {
    "short": "No reason to get excited — cursory has nothing to do with bad language. Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give your new haircut a cursory glance.",
    "long": "Cursory dates to the early 17th century, from the French word cursoire meaning \"rapid,\" which comes from the Latin word cursorius, meaning \"hasty, of a race or running.\" Something that is cursory is done quickly. A teacher might take a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions."
  },
  "contumacious": {
    "short": "That ornery horse that keeps heading back to the barn, no matter how much you coax and pull and try to convince him to stay on the trail? He's showing you his contumacious side, meaning he's stubbornly resisting authority.",
    "long": "You might hear the word contumacious used in a courtroom to describe an uncooperative witness or someone who willfully disobeys an order given by the court. If you have a glove compartment full of unpaid parking tickets, when you finally land in court your disobedient behavior may cause the judge to tell you that you're a contumacious lout. You'll not only have to pay the tickets, you'll also be slapped with a big fine, and you'll never be contumacious again."
  },
  "speculate": {
    "short": "When you speculate, you use what you know to make a prediction about an outcome, like when you speculate that the injury of two key players will prevent your favorite team from going far in the playoffs this year.",
    "long": "The verb speculate has a specialized meaning in the world of finance — it means to take a financial risk in the hopes of monetary gain. For example, a business owner may speculate that a brand-new kind of frozen yogurt will be really popular, so she buys a huge order of it for her ice cream store. Someone who speculates goes looking for the next big thing, as seen in the word's Latin origin, speculatus, meaning \"to spy out, examine.\""
  },
  "inherent": {
    "short": "Use the adjective inherent for qualities that are considered permanent or cannot be separated from an essential character.",
    "long": "We use the adjective inherent to describe attributes that are part of the essential nature of something. It's different from you being tall, rather than being a description, it has to be a quality and this quality is unchangeable. So, for example, if you have never been able to eat spinach, you have an inherent dislike of it."
  },
  "abrasive": {
    "short": "What does an obnoxious person have in common with sandpaper? Both are abrasive. Anything that grates or irritates — physically or metaphorically — can be described using this adjective.",
    "long": "The history of the word abrasive illustrates how a word typically enters the English language and then changes with time.  The English verb abrade, \"to wear down by scraping,\" entered the language from Latin abradere, \"to scrape off,\" in the late 1600s. Some 200 years later, the adjective form of the word — abrasive — came into use to describe a type of grinding tool. By the 1920s, abrasive had acquired the more figurative sense of annoying and infuriating. If you find someone abrasive, he or she grinds away at your nerves."
  },
  "consecrate": {
    "short": "Consecrate means to make holy or to dedicate to a higher purpose. You need to consecrate a building to turn it into a church, but you can also consecrate a week in New York City to the pursuit of the perfect bagel.",
    "long": "The secr part of consecrate comes from the Latin sacer \"sacred.\" Remember that something consecrated is dedicated to God and thus sacred. And then remember that the meanings of words tend to stretch; over time this one moved from \"dedicated to God\" to \"dedicated to whatever\": jelly donuts, the perfect tan, finding a solution to Rubik's Cube."
  },
  "incorporate": {
    "short": "To incorporate is to include or integrate a part into the whole. Incorporate is a more active version of the word \"include\"; if you incorporate, you are adding something to the mix.",
    "long": "In the business world, to incorporate is a legal process. In other usages, the word incorporate really just means to include something or work something into whatever was already existing. You could incorporate your new roommate's furniture into the decor of your apartment, but you may not find a way to incorporate her cat's litter box."
  },
  "exhilarate": {
    "short": "Exciting or thrilling things might exhilarate you.  If you love acting, just the thought of being on stage might exhilarate you, giving you a feeling of giddy excitement.",
    "long": "The Latin word exhilarare meant \"to gladden\" and exhilarate still holds a similar meaning today.  If you feel down, maybe imagining a high, clear sky on a fresh, cool day can exhilarate your spirit.  You found out that driving a race car exhilarates you but only makes your friend carsick.  I hope you brought some rags."
  },
  "prose": {
    "short": "Prose is so-called \"ordinary writing\" — made up of sentences and paragraphs, without any metrical (or rhyming) structure.",
    "long": "If you write, \"I walked about all alone over the hillsides,\" that's prose. If you say, \"I wondered lonely as a cloud/that floats on high o'er vales and hills\" that's poetry. See the difference? (Let's not get into prose poetry!) From prose we get the term prosaic, meaning \"ordinary\" or \"commonplace,\" or lacking the specially delicacy and beauty of its supposed opposite — poetry."
  },
  "fame": {
    "short": "Fame is what you have if you're a celebrity: a lot of people know who you are. A musician's fame might mean she wears sunglasses and a baseball cap to disguise herself when she's in public.",
    "long": "Movie stars, rock stars, well-known public figures — these are all people who have achieved some amount of fame. You may have a kind of fame in a much smaller sphere: \"She won every spelling bee in the state, which gave her some fame at her school.\" Fame is an Old French word that means \"reputation or renown,\" from the Latin fama, \"rumor, reputation, or renown,\" and also \"ill-fame\" or \"scandal.\""

  "manual": {
    "short": "Something manual is operated by human hands. Before Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, picking cotton was a manual job. Nowadays, farmers might need to read a manual to know how to operate a cotton gin.",
    "long": "The word manual comes from Latin root words meaning \"of the hand,\" and the adjective form of the word still maintains that meaning — \"by hand or of the hands.\" The adjective definition is also extended a bit to mean something done by hand and not machine, and the implication is usually that it is physical work. As a noun, manual means \"an instruction booklet or handbook.\""
  },
  "collusion": {
    "short": "If you are making secret agreements with someone, then you are in collusion with them. Every time gas prices jump, consumers suspect the gas station owners of collusion and price fixing.",
    "long": "The noun collusion almost always implies that plans are being made because of some nefarious, most likely illegal, purpose. An art thief could be in collusion with a museum director to steal a famous painting from an art museum. Things get sticky when there is collusion between government and business, between union and management, or between your siblings."
  },
  "impetus": {
    "short": "An impetus is the force behind something, whether it's a boulder rolling down a hill or a person making a decision.",
    "long": "Very little would get done if there were no such thing as an impetus: an impetus is some kind of force that gets something or somebody moving. If you push a car that's out of gas, you're the impetus that's getting it moving. An impetus doesn't have to be physical. Advertisers hope their commercials will be an impetus to buy the product."
  },
  "ostracism": {
    "short": "If you banish someone from society, you've caused that person's ostracism. Quakers, for example, faced ostracism by Puritans in colonial Massachusetts and many of them fled to the nearby colony of Rhode Island.",
    "long": "Ostracism comes from the Greek word ostrakon, a broken shard of pottery. Athenians used pieces of  pottery as a paper substitute in an annual vote in which citizens chose to banish someone from Athens for a period of ten years. The banished person had to leave (or face death) but was allowed to keep his property and could return when his ostracism was up. The vote was often used to get rid of potential tyrants and political rivals."

  "zephyr": {
    "short": "Besides being the name of Babar's monkey friend in the much-beloved picture books about the elephant Babar, a zephyr is a gentle breeze.",
    "long": "In Greek mythology, Zephuros was the god of the west wind, and the bringer of light and early spring breezes. Zephyr derives from his name. That first day of spring, where suddenly you don't have to wear your jacket to school for the first time all winter? Thank the zephyr for that."
  },
  "belle": {
    "short": "A belle is a young woman singled out for being more attractive and charming than other women, as in the phrase belle of the ball. Cinderella was the belle of the ball, at least until midnight.",
    "long": "Belle comes from the Latin bella for “beautiful.” If you ever hear a woman being called a belle, it has nothing to do with ringing; she's super foxy. A Southern Belle is a lovely girl from the South, like Scarlett O’Hara from Gone with the Wind. A belle can be from anywhere, though, as long as she stands out. A belle has rivals, but she is more attractive and desirable. The belle is a little like the prom queen."
  },
  "inflate": {
    "short": "Using your own breath or an air pump, you can inflate a balloon — or anything else you need to pump air into. When you inflate something you fill it with air (or any other gas) to make it expand.",
    "long": "From the Latin verb inflāre, \"to blow into,\" the word inflate appeared in English in the early 16th century. Although we usually think of the word inflate as referring to blowing air or gas into a balloon or a tire, anything that grows larger, from food prices to an egoist's self-image, can be inflated. When an item becomes scarce, its price is likely to be inflated."

    "short": "An intermediary is someone who acts as a go-between or a mediator between two other people. Be careful when you're the intermediary between two friends who are fighting, because they might both end up mad at you!",
    "long": "The word intermediary comes from the Latin intermedius, which is also the root word for intermediate. Inter- means between, and medius means the middle — intermediary retains that sense of being in the middle. Intermediaries are used to negotiate between two countries who are at odds, between a company and a client over a contract, between two bickering children, or between a boss and an employee in salary negotiations."
  },
  "ample": {
    "short": "Ample describes an abundance of something. An ample supply of apple muffins at the bake sale is a good thing, as is ample legroom in your new van — but if the vet notices your dog's ample waistline, you might have to put Fido on a diet.",
    "long": "Like amplify (crank up the volume), ample is from the Latin word amplus, meaning \"large or spacious.\" Ample can be enough or even too much of something. It's great when there's ample parking or ample snacks for a hike, and we'd all be happy if we had ample time and money. But there are things that some people don't want more of — if your principal has ample evidence that you started the food fight in the cafeteria, you're probably going to end up in detention."
  },
  "hypocritical": {
    "short": "Hypocritical involves acting in a way that goes against your stated beliefs. If you drive drunk despite the fact that you are the president of Students Against Drunk Driving, you are truly hypocritical.",
    "long": "Hypocritical comes from the Greek hypokritikos which means acting a part. The word comes up most often when discussing political and religious figures who are sometimes caught engaging in behavior that goes against their professed beliefs. A person who engages in hypocritical behavior could be called a hypocrite, their behavior, an act of hypocrisy."
  },
  "cardinal": {
    "short": "A cardinal is a bright red songbird, and the word also refers to the bird's crimson color. In Catholicism, a cardinal is a high-ranking bishop. In math, you use cardinal numbers to count. A cardinal rule is one that is central and should not be broken.",
    "long": "Okay, that's a lot of definitions. How exactly are they related? In most cases, cardinal means central or essential. It's a cardinal principle that you use it to describe words of behavior like rule or sin. In the Church, cardinals form the central governing body, and in math the cardinal numbers (one, two, three) are the numbers you learn and use first."
  },
  "barefaced": {
    "short": "If masked means hidden, barefaced means unconcealed. If you get caught speeding and reach into your wallet and hand the officer $20, that’s a barefaced attempt at a bribe.",
    "long": "Barefaced — or as it's sometimes known, bald-faced — behavior is always bold and sometimes shameless. Nonchalantly telling a security guard at the jewelry store that you \"plain forgot\" you'd slipped the necklace into your pocket is a barefaced lie and shameless to boot. A reporter's barefaced questioning of a mayor found to be stealing from city treasury carries no shame, on the other hand  — at least not for the reporter."

  "deride": {

    "long": "To \"ride\" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to deride is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. Deride comes from the Latin root dērīdēre, meaning \"to ridicule, to scorn,\" and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns."
  },
  "conflate": {
    "short": "Conflate is a more formal way to say \"mix together,\" and it's typically used for texts or ideas. You probably wouldn't say you conflated the ingredients for a cake, but if you blended two different stories together to make a new one, conflate would work.",
    "long": "The verb conflate comes to us from the Latin word conflare, which literally means \"to blow together.\" So think of using this word when you want to talk about two things getting thrown together and combined. Things that have been conflated often seem mixed up or confused. In fact, this word is also now sometimes used to mean \"confuse or mix up.\""
  },
  "cadence": {
    "short": "The word cadence has its own lovely cadence — rhythm of sound as it's spoken.",
    "long": "Cadence has come to mean \"the rhythm of sounds\" from its root cadere which means \"to fall.\" Originally designating falling tones especially at the end of lines of music or poetry, cadence broadened to mean the rhythms of the tones and sometimes even the rhythm of sounds in general. Think of the cadence of the marching band at a football game or the cadence of the crickets on a warm spring night. You can remember the \"fall\" idea by thinking of one of the only words that contains it — decadence — which has the prefix de- at the front to mean down, or downfall."

  "trivial": {
    "short": "Something that is trivial is not important or significant, such as the trivial details you shared with me about your trip to the post office this morning.",
    "long": "Trivial can also describe something that isn't deep or meaningful, like a trivial movie that you'll forget about after the credits roll. It comes from the Latin word trivium: tri means \"three\" and via is \"road.\" So a trivium is a \"place where three roads meet,\" meaning a crossroads — just something ordinary. So something that is trivial is not worth remembering; it just isn't important."
  },
  "imbibe": {
    "short": "Imbibe is a fancy word for \"drink.\"  If you need to imbibe ten cups of coffee just to get out of the house, you might have a caffeine problem.",
    "long": "Although the verb imbibe means to take in liquids of any sort, if you don't specify the liquid, people are likely to infer you mean an alcoholic beverage.  You can also use it figuratively.  If you have imbibed every detail about every battle of the U.S. Civil War, you must find the subject interesting."
  },
  "credulous": {
    "short": "People who believe things easily without having to be convinced are credulous. Sales people are always hoping that someone credulous picks up the phone during a sales call.",
    "long": "Credulous comes from the 16th-century Latin credulus, or \"easily believes.\" A synonym for credulous is gullible, and both terms describe a person who accepts something willingly without a lot of supporting facts. Calling someone credulous can imply that the person is naive and simple. An individual isn't necessarily insulted by being called credulous, though, because some objects of belief, like religions and unicorns, come with a willing leap of faith for believing in what is unseen."

  "inflammatory": {
    "short": "In medical terms, something that is inflammatory causes a local reaction that shows up by swelling, heat, pain, and redness. If you are stung by a bee, you may have an acute inflammatory reaction to the sting.",
    "long": "The noun inflammatory also refers to something that excites anger, violence, rebellion, or similar strong emotions. In this case, the noun usually refers to speech or writing. If you are a politician, inflammatory speeches may be one tool you use to incite your constituents to vote against the corruption of your opponent. After all, a stirring speech about rights people may lose if an election goes a certain way is more likely to get out the vote than a more understated discussion."

  "allay": {
    "short": "The verb allay is used when you want to make something better or eliminate fears and concerns.",
    "long": "When you allay something, you are calming it or reducing difficulties. It is used commonly in the context of to allay concerns and to comfort and some of its many synonyms are alleviate, decrease, mitigate, assuage and mollify. Allay comes from the Old English word alecgan, which means \"to put down,\" as in literally \"to lighten.\" So, if you can allay someone's fears, you are lightening their mood!"

    "short": "Daunt means to frighten or scare off. The Cowardly Lion's efforts to daunt Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man were less than successful.",
    "long": "Daunt rhymes with haunt, another word which means to frighten, though in a creepier sense. Walking through your neighbors' haunted house on Halloween might daunt your little brother, even though he's unlikely to encounter anything scarier than plastic skeletons and ghosts made of sheets. Daunt often shows up as part of the adjective undaunted, which describes someone who remains unafraid or perseveres in the face of scary circumstances."

  "dyspeptic": {
    "short": "Dyspeptic is an old-fashioned word not often used anymore. It describes someone who is irritable due to depression or indigestion.",
    "long": "Nowadays we separate people who are depressed from people who are cranky because of indigestion, but dyspeptic rolls both these conditions into one ball of fun. A common dyspeptic type would be an old man shouting \"Get off my lawn!\" to kids playing on the street."

  "anecdote": {
    "short": "A short, amusing true story is an anecdote. You might come back from a crazy spring break with a lot of anecdotes to tell.",
    "long": "The roots of anecdote lie in the Greek word anekdota, meaning \"unpublished.\" The word's original sense in English was \"secret or private stories\" — tales not fit for print, so to speak. It can still have connotations of unreliability, as in the phrase \"anecdotal information.\" But the most common sense today is that of \"a funny story about something that happened.\""

  "plucky": {
    "short": "To be plucky is to show courage. Plucky people are often underdogs fighting against the odds, like a plucky kid who scares away a burglar or a plucky kitten who refuses to run away from a Great Dane.",
    "long": "Pluck is courage or heart, so to be plucky is to have those qualities. This word describes brave people and actions, and it means about the same as feisty and spunky. It often applies to people who bravely struggle against powerful forces. A short person playing basketball is plucky. You can be plucky in fighting a terrible disease. Anyone who refuses to give up, no matter what, is plucky."

  "complaisance": {
    "short": "Complaisance is a quality of being eager to please or happy to follow instructions. Your new puppy's complaisance is going to make her easy to train.",
    "long": "This characteristic is usually positive — think of a happy preschool teacher with a class of cheerful students whose complaisance keeps them sitting eagerly in a circle, listening to a story. Sometimes, however, the word is used for people who unthinkingly follow directions to their detriment: \"The students' complaisance means they keep eating those terrible school lunches without ever questioning why there aren't more fresh fruits and vegetables.\""

    "long": "Have you ever heard of the \"sixth sense,\" the mysterious ability to know something that can't be observed? That's clairvoyance. The ability to tell the future, read someone's mind, or communicate with dead people could all be described as clairvoyance. The French prefix clair, or \"clear,\" combined with voir, \"to see,\" gave us the word clairvoyance."

    "long": "Coming from the Latin illustris, meaning “bright, distinguished, famous,” illustrious is a powerful adjective. It's similar to luster, which is a brilliant shine — so imagine that something illustrious is as wonderful as a sparkling diamond.

    "short": "If something is aseptic it is sterile, sanitized, or otherwise clean of infectious organisms. Hospitals make every effort to keep operating rooms aseptic so that patients don’t contract infections after surgery.",
    "long": "The prefix “a-” almost always means that a word means the opposite of its base. The adjective aseptic, “a-” plus the root “septic,” describes anything that is not septic or is without sepsis. The origin of septic is the Greek word septikos meaning “characterized by putrefaction.” Putrefaction is the rot that happens to flesh after it dies, and when something is aseptic it is free of any rot, filth, bacteria or viruses that could cause disease or death."

To make peanut brittle, bake the ingredients on a cookie sheet then let the brittle cool into sheets which you break into pieces (and then eat — wreaking havoc with your braces). It's ok to use the adjective brittle freely to describe lots of things that will break easily — such as a heart, a theory, or a poorly equipped army."

    "long": "An adjective used to describe that which inspires visions of death and feelings of revulsion, ghastly originated circa 1300. It is very close in meaning to the similarly spelled ghostly. In fact, the word in Old English was originally spelled gastli. But over the years, people confused gastli with ghost, began to adopt the gh- spelling. But don't you forget the \"h\" - that would be a ghastly spelling error on your part."

  "evanescent": {
    "short": "A beautiful sunset, a rainbow, a wonderful dream right before your alarm clock goes off — all of these could be described as evanescent, which means “fleeting” or “temporary.”",
    "long": "Evanescent comes from the Latin ex, meaning \"out of,\" and vanescere, meaning \"to vanish.\" When pronouncing this word, emphasize the third syllable and note that the c is silent. You might want to practice saying evanescent a few times right now; if you stumble over pronunciation when you need this word the most, whatever you’re describing — be it a shooting star or a whiff of fragrant perfume — will be gone."

    "long": "Many words with \"du\" have meanings with \"two\" or \"duo.\" Duplicity is from a Latin word meaning \"twofold, having two parts.\" Someone who shows duplicity is two-faced — maybe showing one side in public and another in private — or is just a liar, saying something known to be untrue or misleading. A fraud uses duplicity to gain something with false promises, and someone described as \"fake\" might use duplicity just to fit in or be accepted."

  "encomium": {
    "short": "An encomium is a fancy word for a formal speech or piece of writing that warmly praises someone or something.",
    "long": "Encomium comes from the Greek word enkomion which, in a nutshell, is to honor someone or something at a party in a poetic speech. It used to refer to the song for the winner of the Olympic Games, sung at a victory celebration. You might hear an encomium at a retirement party, after you publish a fabulous book, or even at a funeral (a eulogy, or speech at a funeral about the person who died, is a kind of encomium).

    "long": "Consider the Greek word eikōn, or \"image,\" coupled with -klastēs, \"one who breaks,\" and you get a good image of someone who is iconoclastic. An iconoclastic approach to religion involves tearing down the icons representing the church. While this was once done physically, through riots and mayhem, today’s iconoclasts usually prefer using words. Not all iconoclasts are destructive, however.

In literature, fantasy — a genre similar to science fiction — might include a story about a three-headed squirrel and a bionic aardvark who fall in love on a planet made entirely of strawberries.

    "long": "To activate something is to make it active. It’s not just for bad guys — when you activate a credit or library card, you can start using it. When a coach activates a player on a sports team, the player enters the game. If someone activates a bomb, you should run. If the pancakes you’re cooking burst into flames, you’ll probably activate the smoke alarm. And you should run."

  "authentic": {

    "long": "In addition to describing something real, the adjective authentic describes something reliable, based on fact, and believable. If you have to write a research paper for school, be sure to use authentic facts and figures.

  "culprit": {
    "short": "A culprit is a person who does something wrong, like committing a crime. When your wallet got stolen out of your pocket, there was a culprit to blame in the crowd.",
    "long": "The word culprit comes from the Anglo French words cul prit, a contraction of culpable, which means \"deserving blame.\" A culprit isn't always a person; it can be anything that caused something bad to happen — even a sock left on the steps can be a culprit if it makes you slip and fall. Don't confuse culprit with scapegoat, which is a person or thing that gets blamed for something it didn't do."

    "long": "From the Latin sparsus, meaning “scattered,” we get the adjective sparse, which means “few and scattered.” Thinning hair is sparse, as is the population of an endangered species.

  "ambidextrous": {

    "long": "Coming from the Latin word ambidexter, which means “right-handed on both sides,” ambidextrous describes someone who can use either hand to write, swing a bat or catch a ball. Lucky ducks. In a broader sense ambidextrous means \"facile\" or \"skillful.\" But when it first came into use in the 1530's, ambidextrous had more sinister connotations with the practice of deceitful double-dealing."

  "appropriate": {
    "short": "Something appropriate is correct and fits the situation. A sweater-vest with reindeer on it is appropriate holiday apparel, even if it's totally embarrassing.",
    "long": "The adjective appropriate is used when something is suitable or fitting. It comes from the Latin appropriare, which means \"to make something fit, to make something one's own.\" Going back even further, appropriate is related to the Latin word proprius, \"to belong to a person, thing, or group.\" Another appropriate way to use this word is as a verb, meaning to steal or seize something, the way you'd appropriate your sister's sandwich if she left it sitting near you."
  },
  "obstreperous": {

  "malice": {
    "short": "Malice is the intention to cause harm. If someone feels malice toward you, look out! They've got bad intentions.",
    "long": "Just like the Spanish mal, this is a word for badness or evil. Malice isn't just any evil, though: it's evil done intentionally by someone seeking to do harm. People feel malice for people they hate. Malice is even stronger than spite. Out of all the emotions and thoughts you can have, malice is one of the most dangerous. Just about every villain in every movie and TV show is full of malice."

  "dangle": {
    "short": "Dangle means to hang or swing loosely. If you dangle string above a kitten you will both be entertained.",
    "long": "The verb dangle probably comes from a late 16th century Danish or Swedish word meaning “loose or pendulous,” though we don’t know for sure.

    "long": "As a noun salvage is the act of rescuing stuff from a disaster like a shipwreck or fire — or the rescued goods themselves. As a verb, salvage means to collect or rescue that sort of item, or more generally to save something from harm or ruin. If you want to salvage your grade, you need to stop gaming so much and start studying more."

    "short": "A proclivity is a natural tendency to like something, such as your sister's proclivity for restaurants that serve hot, spicy food.",
    "long": "When you have a proclivity, it feels automatic — you like what you like; you don't even have to think about it. The origin of the word proclivity supports this feeling. Proclivity comes from the Latin word proclivis, which literally means \"sloping forward.\" You slide toward a proclivity — no effort is needed. You just give in to it, since you're headed in that direction naturally."
  },
  "resurrect": {
    "short": "To resurrect is to bring someone back from the dead. You can also resurrect things that are inactive or out of use.",
    "long": "If you've ever seen someone bring a dead person back to life in a science fiction or fantasy movie, you saw them resurrect someone. Turning someone into a zombie or vampire is a type of resurrecting, and in the Bible Jesus resurrects Lazurus. Also, this word can apply to any kind of revival. A song can resurrect faded memories. A forgotten project can be resurrected if you start it up again. Resurrecting always involves bringing something back to life."

It comes from the West Indies, a twist on the French savez vous? — “Do you know?”  Savvy was first recorded in its adjective form in 1905. Synonyms for the noun form include acumen, discernment, grasp, perception, and sharpness."

    "long": "Distract comes from the Latin word for “draw apart.” It can be annoying when someone or something distracts you. A loud car alarm or a talkative friend might distract you when you’re watching your favorite TV show. But being distracted is not always bad. Playing a round of miniature golf might distract you from feeling sad about the death of your parakeet."

You might have a hint that a new acquaintance is an egotist if he uses the word I constantly during your conversations. Egotist was first used in the 1700s, and it initially meant specifically \"talking too much about one's self,\" from the Latin ego, or \"I.\""

Perpetrate, on the other hand, means to commit a criminal act. Needless to say, you wouldn't want to perpetuate the acts of perpetrators!"
  },
  "unctuous": {
    "short": "You might know the idea of the adjective unctuous by other words like \"oily,\" \"smarmy,\" or overly \"flattering.\" When a person is unctuous, you can't trust their kindness, because they usually want something in return.",
    "long": "Interestingly, unctuous is derived from the Latin unctus which means \"anointed with oil,\" which is where the oily connotation comes from. Unctuous and oily are synonyms that both suggest that someone is trying to butter you up; they're being nice, because they're hoping you'll give them what they want. Talk-show hosts, used-car salesmen, people who want your job: all of these are people we think of (rightly or wrongly) as being unctuous. Being an unctuous jerk, he gave me a gift, hoping I'd give him a record deal."

    "short": "When something is veritable it is true, or at least feels that way. \"The trees and lights turned the campus into a veritable wonderland\" means that the campus seemed to be transformed into a true wonderland (if there is such a thing).",
    "long": "Veritable comes from the Latin veritas which means true. But unlike true, it does not describe things like statements. It is often used to enhance the word that follows it. \"A veritable cornucopia of food\" is a lot of food of different varieties. If someone calls you \"a veritable force of nature,\" they don't mean that you are actually a hurricane; they just mean that you have the unstoppable quality of a big old storm."

  "precipitate": {

    "long": "Precipitate, as a verb, can also mean specifically, \"to fall from clouds,\" such as rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation. When used as an adjective, precipitate means \"hasty\" or \"acting suddenly.\" If you decide to throw your class project in a trash masher just because someone in your class had a similar idea, then your actions might be described as precipitate. Or if you do that sort of thing regularly, you may be a precipitate person."

Many classic children's books feature mettlesome main characters, like Huckleberry Finn and Ann of Green Gables.

    "long": "The word conscience contains the word science, which comes from the Latin word scientia, meaning \"to know\" or \"knowledge.\" You can think of your conscience as your knowledge of yourself, especially when it comes to your own morals, or your feelings about right and wrong. Pangs of conscience, which feel like an uncomfortable inner voice, are helpful when you're trying to decide the right thing to do in a particular situation."

Because pundit is a lovely word that is very close to its Sanskrit root, payndita-s, \"learned man or scholar.\" Originally, a pundit was a \"learned Hindu\" or Sanskrit expert. Today's classic examples of the pundit are guests on talk radio and professional sports commentators, all brilliant dispensers of insights, statistics, and occasional hot air."

If you walk into a store and buy the first pair of pants in your size, no matter what they look like, you are an indiscriminate shopper.

They affect all people without considering the differences in their lives."

    "long": "The verb detract comes from the Latin word detrahere, meaning “draw away from,” or “take down.” If you detract from someone’s credibility, you reduce — or take down — that person's worth. When you make valid points opposing an argument a politician is making, you detract from her platform. Detract can also describe drawing attention away from something.

    "long": "When you think of abhorrent, think of horror, as in something so vile and loathsome that you can only react to it in horror. In fact, the word abhorrent in Latin means “to recoil (back away) in horror.” Note that the ending is spelled -ent with an e, not an a.

    "long": "When you want things to appear different than they really are, you might be tempted to put on a charade, like a charade of happiness when you are really feeling down. Charade is also the name for a silently-acted clue in the game called Charades — which originally wasn't silent. It used indirect descriptions of the words."

  "board": {
    "short": "A board is a plank or surface, sometimes having buttons or controls. You can cut vegetables on a cutting board, post a flyer on a bulletin board, or cause a power outage on a circuit board.",
    "long": "The word board frequently finds itself as half of a compound word where the action takes place: You stand on a surfboard, type at a keyboard, or lose on a checkerboard. You can also sit on a board, meaning a team, of directors, or board, meaning stay, at a hotel. If you want to leave your hotel, you may board, or climb onto, your hovercraft.

    "long": "Skulduggery is an alteration of the Scottish word for \"adultery,\" sculdudrie. Lies, deceit, dirty tricks? Sounds like skulduggery — or using clever words to take advantage of a situation, or person — is involved. However, skulduggery can have many other goals, from lying to potential customers about what a product can do or telling voters anything they want to hear in order to secure their votes."

  "pronounced": {
    "short": "You can't miss something that's pronounced, because it's totally obvious. If you sprain your ankle playing soccer, you might walk with a pronounced limp for a few days.",
    "long": "When things are pronounced, they're noticeable or conspicuous, like the pronounced lines in your grandfather's face or the pronounced Italian accent of your new neighbor who just arrived from Rome. The original meaning of this word was simply \"spoken,\" and you can also use it that way: for example, the word \"eve\" has one pronounced e and one silent e. But the \"emphatic or obvious\" meaning is far more common."

  "existential": {
    "short": "If something is existential, it has to do with human existence. If you wrestle with big questions involving the meaning of life, you may be having an existential crisis.",
    "long": "Existential can also relate to existence in a more concrete way. For instance, the objections of your mother-in-law may pose an existential threat to the continuation of your Friday night card game. Often the word carries at least a nodding reference to the philosophy of existentialism associated with Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, and others, which emphasizes the individual as a free agent responsible for his actions."

Bedraggled people haven't gotten enough sleep and aren't quite as pulled together and polished as they might like to be. Bedraggled is an 18th-century word, from the now-obsolete verb bedraggle, combining be and draggle, \"make wet and dirty\" or \"lag behind.\""

  "facade": {
    "short": "A facade is the front of a building, or a kind of front people put up emotionally. If you're mad but acting happy, you're putting up a facade.",
    "long": "This word has to do with the outer layer of something. One sense has to do with the front or outside of a building. The other meaning has to do with people who are hiding something. In both cases, the facade could be deceiving. A building with a gorgeous facade isn't necessarily gorgeous inside. A person putting on a facade is definitely putting on a front: the face they're showing to the world doesn't match how they're feeling."

    "long": "In the strictest sense, suppress means to put an end to something by force, like a government that suppresses the right to free speech by shutting down the newspapers or the military suppressing an uprising by rebel forces. But we also use suppress in less serious terms to describe an attempt to muffle or stifle something, such as suppressing a sneeze in a quiet theater or suppressing your true emotions to not cause a teary scene."

    "short": "If you assure your boss that you’ll finish your project by Tuesday, you are make a promise or commitment to have it done by Tuesday.",
    "long": "The verbs insure and ensure look and sound like assure but they aren't synonyms. There is some overlap in meaning — all of them can mean “to make secure or certain” — but assure is generally used in situations when you are referring to a person: “I assure you that I haven’t forgotten about driving you to the airport” or “He called his mother to assure her that everything will be fine.”"

    "long": "The verb amalgamate originally referred specifically to the mixture of metals; now however, it refers to any mixing or blending.

    "long": "You can conspire with someone, meaning you team up with another person to plot against someone else, or you can conspire against someone. This means you devise a scheme to do that person harm.

    "long": "If you’re the only one who hates, say, your math teacher, it’s not fair to say that person is reviled. If she is majestically unpopular with the entire senior class and is routinely the butt of geometry-themed insults, well then sadly, this instructor is indeed reviled.  Generally, when someone or something is reviled, much of the poison aimed is in print, such as critical reviews or insulting editorials."

  "envision": {
    "short": "The verb envision means to imagine or picture. Kids often envision themselves doing exciting things when they grow up, like being movie stars, professional athletes, or astronauts.",
    "long": "The word envision comes from the Latin en-, which means \"cause to be,\" and visionem, meaning \"a thing seen.\" Career paths aren't the only things that can be envisioned. If you envision a cleaner world, you may volunteer to pick up trash on the beach. If you envision a more peaceful world, you might make your brother and sister play in separate rooms to stop them from screaming at each other."

    "long": "The verb emigrate comes from the Latin word emigrare, which means “move away,” or “depart from a place.” The words emigrate and immigrate both mean that a person has decided to permanently live in a foreign country, but to emigrate is to leave your country, and to immigrate is to come into a new country. To emigrate is to exit."

    "long": "The word comestible, a rather formal-sounding word for food, has its roots in the Latin word comedere, which means \"to eat up.\" Since comestible shares a background with the word consume, you will hopefully remember its meaning. Comestible was first recorded in the 15th century, and it bounced around as an adjective before becoming a noun in the 19th century."

You can also use the adjective lucid to describe your mind or thoughts when you're thinking in a rational, sensible way: \"I was worried about my grandmother's confusion yesterday, but she seems really lucid today.\" Another meaning is \"translucent,\" or \"letting light shine through\" — which makes sense since lucid comes from the Latin lucidus, \"light or clear,\" with its root of lux, \"light.\""

If a swindler is trying to sell you fake medicine, then he is \"preying on your credulity.\" This noun is associated with being naïve, gullible or innocent. It shouldn’t be confused with credibility, which means “believability,” although it is often misused in this way.

This presents a problem if your current car is deficient in some way––say, it no longer has enough engine power to drive up a hill. You may not feel you have what it takes to get a job, but the reality is you will have to chose between indulging your own deficiencies in this area or the car's."

  "defer": {
    "short": "Defer means to put off or delay. You can try to defer the inevitable by pushing “snooze” and falling back asleep, but eventually you're going to have to get up.",
    "long": "If you're excellent at pushing things to a later date and a master at procrastination, then you already know how to defer. But defer can also mean to comply with another person’s opinion or wishes. So when your boss finds out you deferred your work to shop online instead, you should probably defer when she asks you to come in and finish everything up over the weekend."

  "rift": {
    "short": "Rift sounds like rip, and it's helpful to think of it that way. When there is a rift in a political party over a particular policy, it is like a rip or tear in the fabric of the group.",
    "long": "Rift has a slightly different sense than break. A group can have a rift without having fully broken apart. A rift can heal, though a break is permanent. A rift can arise between sisters over whose turn it is to do dishes; it can quickly heal when parents promise an ice cream trip when the dishes are done. The Earth's crust has rifts, where it's splitting apart, like in East Africa."

  "disproportionate": {

    "long": "If you live in New York or Los Angeles or another very expensive city, you probably spend a disproportionate amount of your income on housing — meaning you pay more than you'd expect. If you have a sweet deal somewhere and pay very little in rent, it's still disproportionate — only this time it's less than you'd expect."

  "perceptive": {
    "short": "If someone calls you perceptive, they mean you are good at understanding things or figuring things out. Perceptive people are insightful, intelligent, and able to see what others cannot.",
    "long": "Perceive means \"to see\"; so,  perceptive is a word to describe someone who is good at seeing. Perceptive is derived from the Latin word percipere which means \"to obtain or gather.\" A perceptive person is good at gathering information and using her senses to take in the world. If you are upset but trying to hide it, a perceptive person is the one who will notice."

Beautiful scenes are riveting, but terrible and ugly things are also riveting, like the site of an accident you can't stop looking at. Words from a teacher or actor have a riveting effect when they're full of impact and interest, and when you exaggerate a story for your best friend, that's riveting too."

  "ponder": {

    "long": "Think of ponder as reflecting on weighty thoughts. It will help you remember the definition if you can remember the word's Latin roots. It comes from ponderare, which literally meant to weigh, and pondus, which means weight.

You may tap your chin for a second and say, \"Let me ponder that.\" Pause. \"Um, no!\""

    "short": "If you are feeling lassitude, you're weary and just can't be bothered. Couch potatoes make lassitude into an art form.",
    "long": "Lassitude might sound like latitude, but the two words don't mean the same thing. Latitude describes the distance of a particular location from the equator. Lassitude is the weariness you'd experience after attempting to run a marathon around the equator. Lassitude can also describe a lack of interest, like deciding you'd rather lie on your couch than run that marathon along the equator."

  "agriculture": {
    "short": "Agriculture describes the practice of growing crops or raising animals. Someone who works as a farmer is in the agriculture industry.",
    "long": "The Latin root of agriculture is agri, or \"field,\" plus cultura, \"cultivation.\" Cultivating a piece of land, or planting and growing food plants on it, is largely what agriculture means. Raising animals for meat or milk also falls under the category of agriculture. If we didn't have agriculture, we'd all be running around the woods, picking berries and trying to shoot things."

Particularly large or tall people are almost inevitably said to lumber, as the common phrase \"lumbering giant,\" attests. You never hear of a tip-toeing giant, but some of them must.

  "drab": {
    "short": "Dull, dreary, dingy, depressing: These adjectives capture the sense of drab, whether the word is used to describe a muted color, a miserable mood, or an oppressively boring existence.",

A little over 100 years ago, people began using drab in the metaphorical sense to mean \"dull\" and \"lacking brightness.\" If a website or an advertisement is drab, the page is boring and unattractive.

    "long": "Humility comes from the Latin word humilis, which literally means low. If you feel humility in front of someone, you feel small in the scheme of things — that you are just a simple, insignificant person. Someone who spends his life taking care of others shows humility. Although it's related to humiliation (which makes you feel low in a bad way), humility is usually used to talk about a lack of ego."

Listing can be done numerically, alphabetically, or randomly. Also, a line or surface that leans or tilts has a list, like a sagging bookcase that's overloaded.

    "long": "Fallacious comes ultimately from the Latin fallax, \"deceptive.\" The word fallacious might describe an intentional deception or a false conclusion coming from bad science or incomplete understanding. A tween's assumption that anyone over 20 can't understand her situation would be fallacious; we have all been young once too."

    "long": "The adjective impermanent is useful for talking about things that are fleeting or transitory; bubbles, the summer, a baby's cute lisp, and a wonderful dream are all impermanent. Many religions, especially Buddhism, emphasize the impermanent nature of everything in life, and the inevitability of change. The word at the root of impermanent is permanent, from the Latin permanere, \"endure, continue, or stay to the end.\""

    "long": "When you break apart the word laudable, you can see the verb laud, meaning praise or acclaim, followed by the suffix -able, which is a tip-off that this word is an adjective. So laudable describes things that are worthy of praise, such as a laudable effort to end poverty, and it can also describe admirable ideas or beliefs, such as a laudable compassion for others."

In fact, the word comes from old German and Dutch words for \"slippery,\" another word that could be used to describe the very same salesman. In addition to meaning \"smooth\" and \"persuasive,\" glib can be applied to the kind of thoughtless comment that could get you into big trouble."

    "short": "A rectangle is any shape with four sides and four right angles.  All squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares (all the sides in a square have to be the same length).",
    "long": "The rect in rectangle comes from the Latin rectus, which means \"right\" or \"straight.\" Because of its right angles, a rectangle has straight sides.  Another word with the same root is rectitude, which means moral uprightness.  A morally upright person is someone who does the right thing, but doing the right thing doesn't make you a square — or a rectangle."

It usually refers to financial behavior but can cross over to social activity as well.

    "short": "You see doctor, and you think of someone doing good — like the medical doctor who saves lives. However, a person who doctors or tampers with a document is adding something wrong or harmful to it, like a lie.",
    "long": "Doctor is the Latin word for \"teacher,\" which makes sense since your doctor is often the one teaching you about how to take care of your body. Anyone who has a PhD, be it in English or Egyptology, is also referred to as a doctor because she holds a doctorate degree. But beware, there's also a market out there for doctored, or tampered-with diplomas, where you can buy a fake degree to call yourself a doctor."
  },
  "exigent": {
    "short": "When you describe something as exigent, you are saying it requires attention: it can't be ignored.",
    "long": "Exigent, which means \"demanding attention,\" comes from the Latin for \"driving out.\" If there's a runaway train driving straight at you, that's an exigent situation — not a good time to stop and write a poem.  When circumstances become exigent, it's time to act.  When exigent questions arise, an answer is necessary.  You can also use exigent for a person who demands attention, usually by complaining.  If you've ever worked as a waiter, you've surely dealt with an exigent customer."
  },
  "awe-inspiring": {
    "short": "When something is so astonishing or magnificent that you can hardly speak, it's awe-inspiring. You dream might be to travel to Arizona to see the awe-inspiring sight of the Grand Canyon.",
    "long": "What's awe-inspiring is in the eye of the beholder — in other words, your first visit to New York may provide one awe-inspiring sight after another, from the towering skyscrapers to the Statue of Liberty. Someone born and raised there might be unimpressed, finding the rugged coast of Maine to be far more awe-inspiring. If something inspires a feeling of awe in you (a sense of overwhelming wonder), it's awe-inspiring."
  },
  "lionize": {
    "short": "The lion is the king of beasts. To lionize someone is to see them as important as a lion. Republicans continue to lionize Ronald Reagan as their ultimate hero.",
    "long": "The lion is a symbol of pride, strength, courage, and nobility, so when you lionize someone, you attribute to them all those marvelous traits. Many people are uncomfortable with being lionized, since being made to seem important comes with responsibilities that are sometimes a burden. After the shooting, the bystander resisted people's efforts to lionize him. He was only doing what any person would do, he protested. \"Don't make me into a hero. I don't want to be lionized.\""
  },
  "edifying": {
    "short": "Anything edifying is enlightening. Edifying things uplift people intellectually or morally and help them learn. Good literature, art, and music are edifying.",
    "long": "The original meaning of edify was \"to build,\" and things that are edifying build up a person, especially in an intellectual or moral way. It’s often used in the negative. If you say something is not edifying, you mean that it’s unpleasant and unacceptable. Edifying applies to things that help you become a better person. A wise saying is edifying. A powerful documentary is edifying. The words of a good teacher are often edifying. Word definitions are definitely edifying!"
  },
  "calorie": {
    "short": "A calorie is the energy that it takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree centigrade. More importantly, a calorie is a unit that you can use to measure the energy in your food.",
    "long": "From the Latin calor, “to heat,” a calorie is a measurement of heat energy (it may be called a small calorie or a large calorie). When you’re out of the chemistry lab, you’ll most often hear calorie in relation to the energy in food or the energy you burn through exercise. It will also usually be referred to in the plural, as calories. This makes sense: just one calorie won’t make any difference in what you weigh, but many calories will!"
  },
  "palliate": {
    "short": "When you palliate something, you try to make something less bad: “City leaders tried to palliate effects of the trash haulers' strike by distributing extra large garbage cans with tight-fitting lids.”",
    "long": "Palliate is the word to use when you want to make something feel or seem better. Palliate doesn’t mean “cure” or “solve.” Instead, something that palliates relieves the symptoms or consequences of something, without addressing the underlying cause. Your dentist might give you pain-killing drugs to palliate the discomfort caused by an impacted molar, but that molar is still there, waiting to cause more trouble."
  },
  "bespoke": {
    "short": "The man in the bespoke suit is likely to be either the best-dressed or the most overdressed person at your backyard barbecue, depending on how you look at it. Bespoke means custom-made.",
    "long": "Clothing that's made to order, tailored especially for you, is called bespoke. It's an adjective that is more common in Britain than in the United States. Bespoke can also describe non-clothing items that are made-to-order, as well as the person who makes such things: a bespoke jeweler. The term was originally bespoken, meaning \"spoken of or arranged beforehand.\" Obviously, if you wanted a custom-made suit, you had to make arrangements before buying it."
  },
  "dormant": {
    "short": "That old dog was dormant for so long he was confused for a furry doormat, but a doormat is likely to stay dormant, or inactive, because it is lifeless: that old dog has some life in him yet.",
    "long": "Volcanoes are described as dormant when they stay cool for a long time, without spewing hot lava and ash. They may have the ability to come to life, but they remain dormant, or inactive. Dormant comes from French dormir, \"to sleep,\" and it refers to living things that are on a break rather than things that have died. Being dormant is being temporarily at rest, although sometimes, as with some cancer cells, things become permanently — and thankfully — dormant."
  },
  "axiomatic": {
    "short": "An axiom is a self-evident truth. The authors of the Declaration of Independence could have written, “We hold these truths to be axiomatic,” but it wouldn't have the same ring.",
    "long": "The root word of axiomatic, axiom, derives from the Greek axioma, meaning \"authority,\" or \"that which is thought worthy or fit.\" We use it to describe statements that have the authority of truth about them, or that seem worthy of the truth, or fit to be described as such. That is, an axiom is a proposition that we don’t generally question because it seems plain enough that it’s true. And axiomatic means evident without proof or argument."
  },
  "hubris": {
    "short": "Hubris is an excess of confidence: a boxer who shouts \"I'm the greatest!\" even though he's about to get pummeled by a much stronger opponent is displaying a lot of hubris.",
    "long": "Hubris is from Greek, where it meant \"excessive pride, violating the bounds set for humans\" and was always punished by the gods. We no longer have the Greek gods, so in English it just refers to over-the-top self-confidence. If you call yourself the best in something, you better have the goods to back it up, since too much hubris can lead to embarrassment and humiliation. It's an age-old human failing: pride goeth before the fall."
  },
  "penitential": {
    "short": "If someone is penitential, they're remorseful about something they did. Being truly penitential for losing your brother's phone means buying him a new one — not just saying, \"Oh, sorry!\"",
    "long": "The adjective penitential is less common than its synonym, penitent, but you can use it whenever you're truly contrite. The penitential letter you write your neighbor after your baseball shatters his kitchen window will probably make you both feel better. This word is often used in a religious context, describing people repenting their sins. The Latin root, pænitere, means \"cause or feel regret.\""
  },
  "abridge": {
    "short": "So the editor wants to cut your epic 800-page history of the stapler to a 150-page summary instead. Don't cry — he just wants to abridge your masterpiece, trimming it down to the more readable essential elements.",
    "long": "Synonymous with abbreviate, condense and cut short, abridge comes from the Latin word abreviare, which means \"to shorten.\" Although it's usually used in reference to wordy texts, one can also abridge or shorten a piece of clothing; a miniskirt is just an abridged version of the old floor length hoop skirt, for example. But abridging something isn't always good: If your civil rights are abridged, they've been lessened in some way."
  },
  "contest": {
    "short": "A contest is a struggle to determine who's tops –- you might wrestle an alligator in a contest of brute strength versus strategy. You can also enter a contest — a yodeling contest or a cake-decorating contest, depending on your talents.",
    "long": "If you're being sued and you respond to the court order saying \"no contest,\" you're saying you're not going to put up a fight. When you put the accent on the second syllable, contest becomes a verb, and it means to dispute something. You lost the election for class president, but you think there was something fishy going on at the ballot box, so you contest the results and ask for a recount."
  },
  "assay": {
    "short": "An assay is a breakdown of a material, examining the individual parts that make up the whole. When you assay a situation, you look at all the elements that created the problem in order to come up with a solution.",
    "long": "The word assay comes from the French word essai, which means \"trial,\" an appropriate sense for a word that means to examine for analysis. As a noun, assay means a test or appraisal to determine the components of a substance or object. As a verb, it refers to the act of analyzing, or of conducting that test. It is usually used in chemistry-related fields like metallurgy and pharmaceuticals, but you can also assay a poem."

    "short": "",
    "long": ""
  },
  "cant": {
    "short": "Cant is language repeated so often and so mechanically that it's essentially empty of meaning. Cant can also mean the specialized jargon of a particular group — like the \"cant of piracy\" (e.g., Ahoy! Lubber! Arrr!).",
    "long": "Possible sources for cant exist in both Irish Gaelic and Latin, and the meanings of both are similar: caint is \"speech,\" while cantare is \"to sing.\" In broader English, the word was first used to mock the singing of monks. As it evolved, cant became the whining of beggars and then the secret language of thieves, and the negative connotations persist in modern usage. As a verb, cant has a completely different meaning: it means to lean or tilt to one side."
  },
  "adore": {
    "short": "Someone you adore gets put on a pedestal. Considering your fear of germs, when you told me that you had shared a toothbrush — I knew you must adore her!",
    "long": "Adore comes from the Latin word adorare, meaning “to worship.”  So when you adore someone, it's more than just a crush. However, like many words of strong emotion, adore gets used in lighter situations as well. Your aunt tells me you just adore the miniature fruitcakes she sends you every holiday."
  },
  "coagulate": {
    "short": "When liquid starts to thicken and become solid, it coagulates. When you get a cut, the blood flowing from the wound will coagulate: it will start to clot and form a solid scab so you will stop bleeding.",
    "long": "Many liquids have the potential to coagulate. If the cream you just poured into your coffee is spoiled, you'll see the cream coagulate as it curdles into little floating chunks. If someone has a heart condition that may result in a heart attack, he or she might take medication that keeps the blood in the arteries from coagulating, or dangerously thickening."
  },
  "revert": {
    "short": "While revert means to return to something earlier or to go back, it's often used wrongly in combination. If you're buying the older version of the game, you might say you're \"reverting back,\" which is like saying \"go back back.\"",
    "long": "Revert has been around since the early 14th century, and it has changed little in meaning from the original \"turn back\" and \"return.\" You can revert to a simpler way of life or revert to bad behavior. Software users might revert to an older version of a program with fewer bugs. Though rare in modern use, some international English speakers do use \"revert back\" for \"reply\" in writing and e-mail, but most of the time, using revert with \"back\" is redundant, or repetitive."
  },
  "pseudonym": {
    "short": "A pseudonym is a name that someone, often a writer, uses instead of their real name. The real name of Dr. Seuss was Theodore Seuss Geisel. Mark Twain was a pseudonym for the writer Samuel Clemens.",
    "long": "A near synonym of pseudonym is pen name. Similarly, an allonym is the name of an important person in history that is taken by a writer as a pseudonym. Some of Shakespeare's plays might have been written by other writers using an allonym. If an actor uses a fake name, it is usually called a stage name. And there's no fancy work for nickname — it's just what your family and friends call you."
  },
  "implicit": {
    "short": "Use the adjective implicit when you mean that something is understood but not clearly stated. You might think you and your boyfriend might have an implicit understanding that you are going to get married, but it's probably better to talk it through.",
    "long": "A very near synonym of implicit in this particular meaning is the word implied. But the adjective implicit  also means \"without any doubt,\" so we can say that we have implicit trust or confidence in someone. The Latin root implicāre means \"to involve or entangle.\" Another English word with a more obvious connection to this Latin root is the verb implicate."
  },
  "acerbic": {
    "short": "If you say something acerbic, or harshly bitter, to someone, it can leave a bitter taste in your own mouth that lingers, and the acerbic, or acidic, words can eat away at the person on the receiving end too.",
    "long": "It is fitting that the first part of acerbic sounds like the first part of \"acid,\" because the Latin source of acerbic is acerbus, \"sour-tasting.\" Acerbic speech is like acid, because it is sour and corrodes, or weakens, relationships. There are ways to use sharp words for humor, and some comedians are known for their \"acerbic wit,\" but just as you would take safety precautions in using acid in a science lab, you should be cautious about using acerbic language in conversation."
  },
  "culpable": {
    "short": "If a child tells his mother he was not to blame for the cookie jar being broken, she could still find him culpable if he was the only one home. Culpable means to be at fault.",
    "long": "Culpable is being deserving of blame. If you are culpable of a crime, you are the culprit, or the one who did it. Culpable can be used when looking for the root of the problem rather than a simple who done it. If a teacher leaves the room during a difficult test, and the students decide to cheat, parents might ask whether or not the teacher was also somewhat culpable for the outcome."
  },
  "balloon": {
    "short": "A balloon is a colorful bit of rubber that can be blown up or filled with helium. Many children's parties are decorated with balloons.",
    "long": "While most balloons are round, they come in many sizes and shapes. Balloon artists twist long, thin balloons together to form animals, hats, and other items, and Mylar balloons are made from a kind of thin, metallic paper. Much larger balloons include hot air balloons and weather balloons. In the 1500s, balloon was a game played with a leather ball, from the Italian pallone, \"large ball.\""
  },
  "primacy": {
    "short": "Something with primacy has first importance. If you are deciding who to take on an all-expenses-paid trip up the Amazon, the quality of being chill and fun might take primacy over the number of years you've been friends.",
    "long": "Primacy comes from primary, meaning first, and it is like a condition of always having first place. If you are the teacher’s pet, you might have primacy over your classmates. You can also talk about primacy within a field. Madonna, Beyonce, and Shakira have all at one time or another achieved primacy in the field of pop music. Keep practicing, maybe you'll be next."
  },
  "desultory": {
    "short": "If you lack a definite plan or purpose and flit from one thing to another, your actions are desultory. Some people call such desultory wanderings spontaneous. Others call it \"being lost.\"",
    "long": "The adjective desultory comes from the word desultor, which was a circus rider who would leap from the back of one galloping horse onto another. From this literal sense of jumping from one thing to another, we get the modern meaning of desultory as jumping between things without a logical purpose."
  },
  "invade": {
    "short": "When you Invade, you aggressively take over or occupy a place. If a country's leader wants to gain more land, the military might invade a neighboring country.",
    "long": "Not everything that invades is militaristic. Some things that invade are cultural, such as the phenomena of young, stylish people moving into a neighborhood that had never been thought of as cool before. In an instant, new restaurants and shops catering to the newcomers open and soon the area is overrun with people wearing, say, skinny jeans and complicated eyewear. Natives to the area lament, \"This place has been invaded by hipsters.\""
  },
  "truculent": {
    "short": "If you are quick to argue, always looking for a fight, and hard to please, you are truculent. You can also write a truculent essay, and fans upset by a loss can become truculent.",
    "long": "This word has no connection to truck, but the similar sound is still a good way to remember it: truculent folks are like monster trucks, ready to run over anything that gets in their way. To be truculent is to be defiant, aggressive, and quarrelsome. A truculent student will get in trouble with teachers, and a truculent teacher might get fired. In a violent sport like football, it helps to be truculent, but it's usually not a great quality."
  },
  "cumbersome": {
    "short": "You have to wrestle a bit with the longish word cumbersome; it's cumbersome, or kind of long and clumsy, to tumble out in a sentence. It's hard to use it gracefully.",
    "long": "A \"cumber\" is something that slows you down, and though the words aren't related, \"lumber\" includes big pieces of heavy wood, which might slow down the person carrying them. Moving lumber is cumbersome, because it's a heavy and awkward job. Getting your laundry down the stairs or putting a Rottweiler in the bathtub can be cumbersome too."
  },
  "ordinance": {
    "short": "An ordinance is a local law. Many cities have recently passed ordinances making it illegal to smoke indoors or mandatory for pet owners to curb their dogs.",
    "long": "Ordinance can also mean the act of making someone a priest. In both senses, it means a direction or command coming down from a higher authority or an official conference. If you break an ordinance, you'll likely be fined rather than jailed. Remember that an ordinance is a rule meant to keep things in order."
  },
  "futility": {
    "short": "When you can’t see the point in even trying, that’s the feeling of futility, the sense that no matter how much you work at it, nothing good will happen, so you might as well give up.",
    "long": "What’s the point?  That’s the question asked by anyone who senses the futility of something.  The futility of war makes soldiers put down their weapons, and your father’s strict rules makes any protest an act of futility.   The root word is the Latin futilis, which literally means “leaky.”  Imagine pouring lemonade into a cup that has no bottom.  No matter how long you pour, you’ll never get a sip because of that leaky cup.  Ah, the futility!"
  },
  "avant-garde": {
    "short": "The term avant-garde refers to innovative or experimental concepts or works, or the group of people producing them. Pushing boundaries with his development of Cubism, Pablo Picasso was part of the early 20th-century art world’s avant-garde.",
    "long": "In French, avant-garde means the “vanguard” or the “advance guard” — basically the people and ideas that are ahead of their time. Usually it refers to a movement in the arts, like Dadaism, or in politics, like anarchism. Avant-garde can also be used as an adjective to describe something that’s cutting-edge. You might have enjoyed that avant-garde dance piece in which the performers threw marshmallows at each other, even though it was confusing at times."
  },
  "reassure": {
    "short": "When we reassure other people, we pat them on the head, give them a hug, or say soothing words to convince them that everything is going to be OK.",
    "long": "When someone thinks they aren't smart enough, strong enough, or good enough for something, you reassure them to build their confidence up. Folks who worry a lot need to be reassured all the time, though they might not really believe your reassurances. People can also be reassured by things that happen too: an A on a paper could reassure a student that he's a good writer."
  },
  "cantankerous": {
    "short": "If someone is cantankerous he has a difficult disposition. Take care not to throw your ball into the yard of the cantankerous old man down the street — he'll cuss you out and keep your ball.",
    "long": "The origin of cantankerous is unclear (it may be at least partly from Middle English contek 'dissension'), but ever since it first appeared in plays from the 1770s, it's been a popular way to describe someone who is quarrelsome and disagreeable. It is usually applied to people, but stubborn animals like mules are also described as cantankerous. Events can be cantankerous too, like a cantankerous debate. Some synonyms are cranky, bad-tempered, irritable, irascible."
  },
  "extant": {
    "short": "Use the adjective extant to describe old things that are still around, like your extant diary from third grade or the only extant piece of pottery from certain craftspeople who lived hundreds of years ago.",
    "long": "Extant is the opposite of extinct: it refers to things that are here — they haven't disappeared or been destroyed. Use extant to describe things that it may be surprising to learn are still around — you wouldn't say jeans you bought last year are extant, but a pair of jeans worn by Marilyn Monroe back in the 1950s? Definitely extant."
  },
  "clandestine": {
    "short": "Use the adjective clandestine to describe something that is done in secret, like your clandestine attempts to steal your brother's Halloween candy.",
    "long": "Clandestine, an adjective imported from Latin, describes a secret, usually illegal activity. Often these things have to do with political and spy organizations. The CIA might run a clandestine operation to infiltrate terrorist organizations. Words with similar meanings include secret; covert, used especially for military matters; undercover, common in espionage; and surreptitious which emphasizes a person's efforts to keep something secret."
  },
  "expropriate": {
    "short": "Use the verb expropriate to describe the act of taking people's property, usually by a government. If you really like your neighbor's house, you may wish you could expropriate the property.",
    "long": "To correctly pronounce expropriate, say \"ex-PRO-pree-ate.\" It sounds a lot like another verb, appropriate and has a similar meaning. That's because of their shared Latin root proprius, which means \"own.\" Expropriate is typically used to describe taking property — rather than smaller possessions — and a government or other official organization is usually the one doing the taking. For example, a state may expropriate property in order to build a new road."
  },
  "musty": {
    "short": "Use the word musty to describe an unclean, stale, and possibly moldy smell. If something smells musty that means it’s probably been sitting in a damp corner without any air for a little too long.",
    "long": "Musty smells take time to develop: they’re caused by dampness and mold, and signal some amount of decay. You might also call the smell of a musty old basement rank or foul. But people also use musty to insult someone’s writing, or their ideas. A musty speech wouldn’t just be old-fashioned, it would be old in a bad way: rotten and boring."
  },
  "monomania": {
    "short": "Someone who suffers from monomania is unhealthily preoccupied with something. If your sister talks about nothing but her collection of vintage lunch boxes, you could call it monomania.",
    "long": "It's one thing to be excited about playing Scrabble or preoccupied with local politics, but when any interest gets out of hand, you can call it monomania. The word monomania, from the Greek mono, \"one\" and mania, \"madness,\" was coined by a French psychiatrist in the early 1800s. One of the most famous literary cases of monomania is that of Captain Ahab, obsessed with his pursuit of Moby Dick."
  },
  "tranquil": {
    "short": "When a place or your state of mind is peaceful, quiet and serene, it is tranquil.",
    "long": "Like a pond with no ripples, tranquil means calm and placid. A pleasant state of mind, with nothing to agitate or cause anxiety, can also be considered tranquil.  As you struggle through your yoga poses, the teacher might annoyingly exclaim how tranquil you should be feeling, and when you and your siblings bicker over every little thing, your parents are wishing the house were more tranquil."
  },
  "adversity": {
    "short": "When circumstances or situations work against you, you face adversity. Refugees from war-torn countries encounter terrible adversity.",
    "long": "Adversity, a noun which has been part of the English language for over 800 years, comes from the Latin adversus, literally \"turned against\" and figuratively \"hostile or unfavorable.\" When things seem against you — circumstances or a stroke of bad luck — you are facing adversity. Sometimes people use a form of the phrase \"turning adversity into opportunity.\" This refers to the ability some people or companies have to take a bad situation and make it into a successful one."
  },
  "anachronistic": {
    "short": "Something that's old-fashioned and maybe a little out of place is anachronistic,  like  a clunky black rotary-dial telephone sitting on a desk beside a sleek new smart-phone (or whatever the new technology is when  you read this).",
    "long": "The adjective anachronistic comes from the Greek words ana, or \"against\", and khronos, or \"time.\" It usually refers to something old-fashioned or antique, but it can also mean anything that blatantly clashes with the time in which it is seen. Imagine watching a movie that takes place in the 1700s and seeing one of the characters pull out a cell phone. Any phone, in the context of the movie's time period, would be anachronistic."
  },
  "equivocal": {
    "short": "Equivocal means uncertain or ambiguous. If you ask your teacher what's on an upcoming test and she gives you an equivocal answer, you won't be able to narrow down your studying.",
    "long": "Equivocal is from the Latin aequus, \"equal, the same,\" + vocare, \"to call, to speak,\" and describes when something is too close to call. An editorial in your local newspaper might make a strong case for new taxes on soda, while another editorial is more equivocal. The fact that equivocal means \"uncertain\" and unequivocal means \"certain\" is tricky, and a lot of people get stumped."
  },
  "disrobe": {
    "short": "When you disrobe, you take your clothes off. Before you go swimming, you should probably disrobe and put on a bathing suit.",
    "long": "Everyone disrobes, before we take a shower, change our clothes, or go skinny dipping. To disrobe is simply to get undressed. You might disrobe in a dressing room to try on a tuxedo or disrobe before your karate class so you can put on your white karate gi. The word uses the prefix dis-, \"do the opposite of,\" before robe, with its old fashioned verb sense of \"clothe.\""
  },
  "dissimulate": {
    "short": "Your wife gave you socks for Christmas and you smiled happily and kissed her? You, my friend, know how to dissimulate — that is, cover up your true feelings. Unless you happen to really, really like socks.",
    "long": "Sometimes confused with dissimilar, meaning \"not alike\", or \"different,\" or a form of simulate, meaning \"to pretend to do or feel something.\" Being able to dissimulate is a useful trick, not just if your wife gives you socks. After all, the whole political process depends on it. As Louis XI once said, \"He who knows not how to dissimulate, can not reign.\" Wikipedia would probably agree with that."
  },
  "clumsy": {
    "short": "Someone clumsy is a klutz. They're awkward, ungraceful, and walk like they have two left feet. Something hard to handle — like a huge box — is also clumsy.",
    "long": "A badly told story is told in a clumsy way, and a couch that's hard to move clumsy to carry. But mostly being clumsy is embarrassing. Dropping things, tripping a lot, and stumbling are all examples of clumsiness. Clumsy people usually aren't too good at sports or dancing. And you certainly don't want a clumsy surgeon. Most people are a little clumsy when they're teenagers — growing so fast makes it hard to be sure of yourself physically."
  },
  "culminate": {
    "short": "The verb culminate is used to describe a high point or a climactic stage in a process. For example, the goal of a Major League baseball team is to have their season culminate in a World Series victory.",
    "long": "The word culminate derives from the Latin word culminatus, the past participle of culminare, which means \"to top or crown.\" Use culminate when you are referring to a crowning moment or a final conclusion: “I want my experiments combining strawberry jam with burnt toast to culminate in a Nobel Prize in Chemistry — or at least a lucrative contract with a major food supplier.”"
  },
  "partial": {
    "short": "If you describe something as partial, you're usually saying it's just part of the whole, or incomplete.  Say someone asks how you started your band and you say, \"I bought a guitar.\" That would be a partial answer, at best.",
    "long": "Partial has another meaning, too.  If you say you are partial to something, you are expressing a fondness for it. Or not.  If someone asks you whether you still love your husband after 50 years of marriage, for example, and you say, \"I'm partial to him,\" you're either joking or politely saying \"Not really.\"  Being partial to something is to love as a warm stove is to a bonfire."
  },
  "catharsis": {
    "short": "Use the noun catharsis to refer to the experience a person can have of releasing emotional tension and feeling refreshed afterwards.",
    "long": "Conceived by Aristotle as the cleansing effect of emotional release that tragic drama has on its audience, catharsis stems from a Greek verb meaning \"to purify, purge.\" Today, it can be used to describe any emotional release, including a good long laugh or cry that is followed by a sense of balance and freshness afterwards."
  },
  "morose": {
    "short": "A morose person is sullen, gloomy, sad, glum, and depressed — not a happy camper.",

We all can be morose at times, like after the death of a friend or family member. Whether you're morose due to an event or just because you're feeling blue, you should try skipping or whistling a little tune to perk things up."

    "short": "To dissemble is to try to deceive someone. Your little brother tried to dissemble when you asked if he ate the last doughnut, but the chocolate icing on his face gave him away.",
    "long": "Dissemble is a little more complicated than a straight lie or denial. When you dissemble, you disguise your true intentions or feelings behind a false appearance. To dissemble is to pretend that you don't know something, to pretend that you think one way when you act another way. \"He worked for six months at that company before they discovered he was dissembling: he had lied on his application about his credentials and education.\""

  "distortion": {
    "short": "A distortion is a change, twist, or exaggeration that makes something appear different from the way it really is. You can distort an image, a thought, or even an idea. To say that I never take out the garbage is a distortion of the facts.",
    "long": "The heat from the highway creates a distortion in the way objects in the distance appear: They wiggle and dance. The heat creates a wavy distortion in the air that shakes up the image of the things beyond it. Things are the way they are: to change them is to distort them or to create a distortion. Some guitar players prefer distortion: they plug their instrument into amps and pedals that twist and stretch the sound so much that you might not even recognize its source as a guitar."

  "interminable": {
    "short": "Use interminable to describe something that has or seems to have no end. Your math class. Your sister's violin recital. A babysitting job where five kids are going through your purse and the parents didn't leave a number.",
    "long": "Something that is interminable is often boring, annoying, or hard to bear, such as an interminable noise. A near synonym is incessant, which also refers to something unpleasant that continues without stopping. It descends from the Latin prefix in-, \"not,\" terminare, \"to end,\" and the suffix -abilis, \"able to.\" Latin terminare is also the source of the English verb terminate, \"to end\" and the corresponding noun termination, \"an act of ending something.\""
  },
  "petulance": {
    "short": "Petulance is whininess and irritability. Your least favorite thing about the kids you babysit might be their petulance.",
    "long": "The noun petulance is the quality of being fretful, complaining, petty, or generally cranky. It's not a pleasant characteristic — it's almost always described negatively, like when you talk about the childishness and petulance of your constantly whining boss or the petulance of a hotel guest who complains about the pillows being too fluffy. Petulance comes from the Latin petulantia, which means insolence or immodesty."
  },
  "misanthrope": {
    "short": "A misanthrope is a person who hates or mistrusts other people. Your great aunt Edna who lashes out at anyone who approaches, convinced they'll steal the jewelry she keeps in her handbag on her lap? A misanthrope indeed.",
    "long": "This is a formal word, derived from Greek misanthrōpos \"hating mankind,\" from misein \"to hate\" plus anthrōpos \"a man.\" From the same root, we get the English word anthropology \"the study of humans.\" If you make a statement or do something that is particularly hostile or untrusting, you can call that misanthropic."
  },
  "recidivism": {
    "short": "Recidivism means going back to a previous behavior, especially criminal behavior. People who work with prisoners are always hoping to lower recidivism rates.",
    "long": "The word recidivism comes from the Latin root words re, meaning \"back,\" and cadere, meaning \"to fall\" — or literally \"to fall back.\" The word is most commonly used to discuss the relapse rate of criminals, who have served their sentence and have been released. However, it can be used for any relapse in behavior. Alcoholics who do not receive support are more prone to recidivism than those in recovery programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous."
  },
  "jubilation": {
    "short": "Jubilation is a happy word. Where there is jubilation, there are laughter, smiles, laughs, joy, and gladness.",
    "long": "Few things in life are as good as jubilation — this is a word for a lot of happiness and celebration. You can find jubilation at parties, and it often breaks out on holidays. When you get good news, you might feel jubilation. When people say \"Yes! or \"Woo-hoo!,\" they are expressing jubilation and are jubilant."
  },
  "glut": {
    "short": "A glut is too much of something. A glut of gas in the marketplace can lower its price. A glut of heavy metal T-shirts in your dresser, however, has nothing to do with the economy but might be a signal that it's time to clean your room.",
    "long": "Glut comes from the Old French gloter, meaning \"to swallow too much.\" The glottis is the part of your body where your vocal folds reside and where you swallow. If you go to the movies alone and get the family tub of popcorn, you are glutting yourself on the salty snack, but do try not to get any popcorn stuck in your glottis. Glut is used more commonly in reference to the economics of the marketplace, where an oversupply of one thing lowers prices."

  "fluid": {
    "short": "Something that is unstable or subject to change can be described as fluid. The fluid political situation in a particular country makes it unsafe to travel there, with the constant possibility of a violent uprising.",
    "long": "A liquid is a fluid — something that flows easily when poured — although gases can also be called fluid. When your doctor told you to drink lots of fluids to help your cold symptoms, she probably meant things like water or orange juice, not root beer floats. If a movement is smooth, it can also be described as fluid. You have to make fluid arm movements in ballet so you look graceful."

  "banter": {
    "short": "Good friends usually banter back and forth easily, like they're trying to keep a step ahead of each other in witty responses. This type of banter is their special language of friendship.",
    "long": "Banter is both a noun and a verb about talking. It comes from unknown origins, but even as a word, it seems to be playful and teasing. You can engage in banter with friends, siblings, parents, and even good-natured strangers. Banter usually ends with everyone feeling better for the talk and verbal play. Joking, joshing, and teasing are all related to banter."
  },
  "venerate": {
    "short": "To venerate is to worship, adore, be in awe of. You probably don't venerate your teacher or boss; however, you may act like you do!",
    "long": "The word hasn't come far from its Latin roots in venerari, \"to worship.\"  Although you can certainly venerate a deity, a person can deserve it, too. We don't usually venerate our friends: instead, we usually save this feeling for deities or remarkable people who inspire awe. Mother Teresa was venerated for her work with the poor, and Gandhi was venerated for his efforts for peace, but most people aren't venerated for normal stuff like taking out the trash or hanging out on a Saturday."
  },
  "loathe": {
    "short": "If you loathe someone or something, you hate them very much. You might not choose to eat raw carrots if you dislike them, but if you loathe them, you might have a hard time even having them on your plate.",
    "long": "This word suggests a strong feeling of disgust. Near synonyms are abhor and detest. The verb loathe descends from Middle English lothen, from Old English lāthian. The related adjective loathsome means \"hateful or disgusting,\" and the adjective loath means \"not willing to do something,\" as in \"I'm loath to cheat on a test, but I don't see what choice I have.\""
  },
  "presumptuous": {
    "short": "When someone takes liberties, doing things too boldly, you can describe them with the adjective presumptuous.",
    "long": "Presumptuous comes from the Latin verb praesumere which means to take for granted. It means taking for granted your access to someone or power to do something. It's a very satisfying and effective word because it belittles and criticizes at the same time. In Shakespeare's Henry VI, Northumberland calls Warwick \"presumptuous and proud\" for trying to get rid of the king.  It's usually pronounced with all four syllables, pre-ZUMP-choo-us, although pre-ZUMP-chus is acceptable as well."
  },
  "chant": {
    "short": "A chant is a type of song with a repetitive, monotonous structure. It’s also something sports fans love to do. At the Olympics, some Americans chant, “USA! USA! USA!”",
    "long": "In addition to being something fans like to yell together, a chant is a traditional form in a lot of religious music. There are Catholic chants, Hindu chants, Jewish chants, and the list goes on. Because of this type of music, “to chant” means “to repeat something in a monotone or repetitive way.” Chants have no harmony or instruments, only a simple rhythm and a lot of repetition."
  },
  "herbivorous": {
    "short": "A buffalo, a goose, a grasshopper, and a stegosaurus sit down to eat dinner.  This isn’t a joke, it’s an example of herbivorous creatures who exist on a diet of plant life only.",
    "long": "Herbivorous comes from the Latin word herba, which means “green plants,” and that’s what herbivorous animals eat all the time: grass, leaves, and other plants.  Some massive and strong animals actually have peaceful herbivorous eating habits, like gorillas and hippopotamuses.  The opposite of herbivorous is carnivorous, which describes meat-eating beasts like lions, sharks, crocodiles, and your uncle Marvin who eats nothing but steak all day long."
  },
  "juxtapose": {
    "short": "See the word \"pose\" in juxtapose? When you juxtapose, you are \"posing\" or positioning things side by side.",
    "long": "The verb juxtapose requires contrasting things placed next to one other: \"The collage juxtaposed pictures of Jane while she was growing up and as an adult.\" Juxtapose is used often when referring to contrasting elements in the arts. \"The music juxtaposed the instrumentation of jazz with the harmonies of soul.\""

  "reverie": {
    "short": "If you're relaxing on the beach, dreaming of how you will never have to get up and go back to work, you're engaged in a reverie, or pleasant daydream.",
    "long": "There's nothing wrong with reverie, but if you follow its path into English, you'll see how closely it is connected to madness. The noun is from French rêverie, from a Middle French word meaning \"wild speech, delirium,\" from rever \"to roam, speak wildly.\" Middle French rever is also the source of English rave, as in raving mad."
  },
  "patriarchal": {
    "short": "A patriarchal system is one run by men. Traditionally, most societies have been patriarchal, but it's now considered sexist and unfair.",
    "long": "The patriarchal way used to be pretty much the only way: countries and societies were run by men. The U.S. was very patriarchal, especially when women couldn't even vote. Over time, these things change, though probably not fast enough. These days, calling a country or business patriarchal is usually an insult — it implies that women aren't being treated equally."

    "short": "If you are shrewd in your spending, you can make a small salary go a long way. Use the adjective shrewd to describe a person or thing that is smart or clever in a practical sort of way.",
    "long": "The word shrewd is from a Middle English adjective formed from the noun schrewe, \"an evil person, a villain.\" This Middle English noun is an earlier form of our modern English word shrew. So shrewd and shrew are related to each other. Shrewd doesn't usually have a disapproving or negative tone, but shrew certainly does."
  },
  "perspicacious": {
    "short": "Perspicacious is an adjective that means \"shrewd\" and \"wise.\" A perspicacious child can't be fooled when her parents try to keep a secret by talking in Pig Latin.",
    "long": "The adjective perspicacious is a long word for a short definition: \"keen\" or \"shrewd.\" This word is descended from the Latin word perspicere, which means \"to look closely.\" In other words, if you look closely at something you are paying attention to it and know it well. A definition of perspicacious that is out of date but still relevant is \"having keen eyesight\" and people who can see clearly are also aware and attentive!"

  "duplicitous": {
    "short": "That guy in the drama club who tells everyone he hates organized sports one day and then joins the football team the next? He's being duplicitous, or pretending to have feelings that his actions contradict.",
    "long": "In duplicitous, you can see the word duplicity, which means \"doubleness.\" Someone who is duplicitous is almost like two people, saying one thing but then doing something very different, even contradictory. Someone who is duplicitous can also be called \"two-faced,\" a vivid way to remember that this person shouldn't be trusted or taken at face value."

    "long": "If you have been following politics for long, you'll hear about plenty of elections: votes held every few years for political office. Mayors, governors, judges, and the President are all put in office by elections. You can also speak of the election of a winner: for example, \"Her election was close.\" An election can also mean any kind of choice, such as \"his election to move to Vermont.\" All the meanings of this word have to do with exercising choice."

  "adolescent": {
    "short": "Adolescent is just a fancy word for teenager — someone who is no longer a child but is not yet an adult. The word can also be used as an adjective. For example, a particular clothing line might be geared toward adolescent girls.",
    "long": "This word refers to all things related to teens — teenagers are adolescent, and the adolescent stage is after puberty and before adulthood. Since adults don't have a high opinion of teenagers, this word is also an insult. Movies full of fart jokes and immature shenanigans are called adolescent. If one adult says to another \"You're acting very adolescent\" that means \"You're acting childish.\" Adolescent means something close to juvenile, another word that refers to young people and childish people."
  },
  "limpid": {
    "short": "The adjective limpid describes something (often liquid) that is clear, serene and bright. Nature calendars often feature glamour shots of a limpid stream or a limpid lake.",
    "long": "The adjective limpid may also describe language that is easily understandable. Your teacher might ask you to give an answer in a single limpid sentence. But he probably won't because limpid is a word that's fallen out of use. Maybe because it sounds too much like limp. Or maybe because it's associated with the king of all clichés: \"Her eyes were like limpid pools.\""
  },
  "fort": {
    "short": "A fort is a place that's made strong and secure enough to be defended during a war. Although it’s usually a military word, you can also make a fort with chairs and a blanket to defend against annoying little siblings.",
    "long": "A fort can also be called a fortress or a fortification, although typically a fortress describes a larger structure or a series of structures, while a fort is usually only one. All of these words come from the Latin word fortis for \"strong, mighty, or brave.” Traditionally, forts have been strongly defended, with thick stone walls and other elements protecting them from invaders. Today in the US, some forts are simply military bases. Others are simply in the living room."

    "short": "To perplex someone is to amaze, baffle, bewilder, dumbfound, flummox, mystify, or puzzle them. Perplexing things are hard to understand.",
    "long": "If you're perplexed, then you're confused. Different things perplex different people. In football, a tricky defense will perplex a quarterback. Complicated formulas can perplex math students. When people do weird things, it can be perplexing. Anything hard to understand might perplex you. Perplexing also means to make something more complicated. So when you see the word perplex, think \"Huh?\""

  "phalanx": {
    "short": "A phalanx is a tightly knit group of people or things, like an army troop or a bunch of fans of the same band.",
    "long": "Phalanx refers to any tightly formed group of soldiers or officers, and historically defines a body of Macedonian infantry whose shields overlapped. From that sense, it came to mean any close-knit group. Another definition of phalanx — any bone in a finger or toe — also came out of the military sense: these bones work together closely, just like a military phalanx. The plural for these bones is phalanges, while  the plural for the other senses is phalanxes."

  "amorous": {
    "short": "If you are shot with a mythological arrow by Cupid, the Greek god of love, you may find yourself feeling amorous. Amorous means having strong feelings of love, especially romantic love.",
    "long": "Amorous words or glances show love or desire. This adjective is a Middle English word, borrowed from Middle French, from Medieval Latin amorosus, from Latin amor \"love.\" A more literary and less common synonym is amatory."
  },
  "proceed": {
    "short": "To proceed means to go or continue forward. But somehow \"ready, set, proceed!\" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.",
    "long": "From the Latin procedere, meaning “go forward, advance,” proceed is a verb that simply means to keep going, particularly after there’s been an interruption. Synonyms include progress and advance. People who constantly interrupt make it really difficult for the conversation to proceed smoothly. And proceed with caution when crossing a busy street, but if the light turns red, you better move it fast!"

  "superfluous": {
    "short": "When something is so unnecessary that it could easily be done away with, like a fifth wheel on a car or a fifth person on a double date, call it superfluous.",
    "long": "Superfluous (soo-PER-floo-uhs) means \"more than required.\" Use it when pointing out something that could be removed without detracting from the quality of something: \"For a climb over a glacier, the very thickest shoes are absolutely necessary; beyond these, all else seems superfluous to me,\" wrote the adventurer Charles Stoddard in 1899. The word comes from Latin and literally means \"overflowing\": super (\"over\") + fluere (\"to flow\"). So you can think of a superfluous addition as flowing over the boundaries of what's needed."
  },
  "cryptic": {
    "short": "\"White bunny. Moon square.\" Do you understand what that means? Of course not! It's totally cryptic. Cryptic comments or messages are hard to understand because they seem to have a hidden meaning.",
    "long": "Cryptic is from Late Latin crypticus, from Greek kryptos, \"hidden.\" This Greek adjective is the source of the English noun crypt, referring to a room under a church in which dead people are buried. That might account for why the word cryptic has an eerie tone to it."
  },
  "ineffable": {
    "short": "Anything ineffable is unspeakably beautiful, moving, or horrible. It’s beyond expression. If something is so powerful or emotional that you can't even describe it, it’s ineffable.",
    "long": "Ineffable ideas and emotions are difficult to put into words. Parents might feel an ineffable sadness and pride when watching their youngest child graduate from high school. Ineffable can also be used to describe a name that is so sacred you’re not allowed to say it.This word comes from the adjective effable, which means “something that can lawfully be expressed in words,” and isn’t used much anymore."

  "porcine": {
    "short": "You might be tempted to describe your greedy lunch companions as porcine, but you should try to resist the urge. Porcine means \"like a pig.\"",
    "long": "The adjective porcine is a scientific term for talking about pigs, but it's also useful for describing anything — or anyone — resembling a pig. A large, shiny-faced man might appear porcine to you, and so might a group of hungry kids who shove and jostle each other to get their hands on a plate of brownies. The Latin root is porcus, or \"pig.\""

  "enunciate": {
    "short": "Can't get your point across? Maybe you just need to speak more clearly or articulate your thoughts better — in short, enunciate.",
    "long": "Good enunciation is similar to pronunciation, but describes more specifically how clearly someone expresses themselves. The word enunciate is related to the Latin words for both \"announce\" and \"messenger.\" So most likely those ancient Romans who created the word wanted a messenger who could announce things without mumbling, grumbling, and rambling."

  "egalitarian": {
    "short": "An egalitarian is a person who believes in the equality of all people, and an egalitarian society gives everyone equal rights.",
    "long": "This is a word that means something close to equality and has to do with fairness. If you believe that everyone deserves a chance to vote, go to school, get good jobs, and participate in society, then you are an egalitarian. When laws make life fairer, the law is getting more egalitarian. The opposite of an egalitarian system could be a fascist society or dictatorship. Monarchies are not egalitarian. When you see this word, think about equality and freedom."

  "magnanimity": {
    "short": "Magnanimous behavior is noble, generous, or unselfish, and to exhibit magnanimity is to be this way. He showed great magnanimity in not pressing charges when I drove his car into the pond. \"Accidents happen my friend,\" he said, and patted me on the back.",

    "long": "Justice is usually associated with the law. A judge is also known as a justice, and the point of the law is to keep everything in a society fair according to society’s rules. Justice (capital “J”) is also the statue of a blindfolded woman holding scales and a sword. If something is brought to justice, the good guys have been rewarded and the bad guys punished — the scales are even."

  "turgid": {
    "short": "Turgid describes something that's swollen, typically by fluids, like a turgid water balloon that's way too big to resist dropping on your friend's head.",
    "long": "Turgid comes from the Latin word turgidus, meaning \"swollen, inflated.\" Turgid can be used in a figurative sense to describe things that are overblown. That might remind you of some people's egos! If a famous singer wants to showcase his incredible vocal range and his love of yodeling in a single song, the result may well be turgid, something so swollen with notes and styles that it seems ready to burst."

  "menial": {
    "short": "A menial task is anything that takes very little training, skill, or talent. Some people find it relaxing to do the menial chore of folding laundry.  Go figure.",
    "long": "The adjective menial comes from an Old French word, mensie, which means “household.”  Many chores that get labeled as menial  are domestic, but other jobs outside of the home are sometimes also considered menial: stuffing envelopes, data processing, repetitive assembly line work, brain surgery (OK, that last one is not considered menial; we were just checking to see if you were awake)."

  "obsolete": {
    "short": "Use the adjective obsolete for something that is out of date. As the Rolling Stones song \"Out of Time\" goes, \"You're obsolete, my baby, my poor old-fashioned baby.\"",
    "long": "Obsolete is from the Latin obsolescere \"to fall into disuse,\" and it is a very handy adjective for anything that is no longer used, from words to factories to computer software to ways of thinking. Something that is obsolete has usually been displaced by a newer, shinier innovation. Compact discs made records and cassettes obsolete, and then downloadable digital music files made compact discs obsolete."

  "amplify": {
    "short": "The verb amplify means to crank up the volume. Speakers amplify, or raise, the volume of the noise coming through a microphone so that everyone at the rock show can hear.",
    "long": "Amplify comes from the Old French word amplifier meaning \"to enlarge or expand.\" It refers to making a sound “expand,” but it can also crank up something like a disagreement — if you spread rumors, you might amplify an argument. It can “enlarge” an idea — if you don't realize how bad your health is, your doctor might amplify your test results by explaining them to you in simple, and possibly frightening terms."
  },
  "stasis": {
    "short": "When nothing's happening, that's stasis. A town government might be stuck in a period of stasis, unable to come to a decision about a controversial issue.",
    "long": "Sometimes opposing forces are equal in power, and since neither is stronger than the other, the result is a state where neither can gain any headway. This state is called stasis, and it is basically a stoppage of movement. In medicine, stasis describes the stopping of any bodily fluids from flowing, usually by an obstruction. The same idea is seen in literary stasis, where there is no forward movement in a story."

Many letters to the editors of newspapers and comments on websites are jeremiads, and someone addressing a city council or school board might make a verbal jeremiad — speaking for a long time about their many grievances. The word jeremiad was coined in 1700s France, as jérémiade, and it was a reference to the Old Testament's \"Lamentations of Jeremiah.\""

  "incline": {
    "short": "Something that slopes — that is, something that deviates from the straight horizontal or vertical — can be called an incline. If you like to walk up and down hills, you enjoy walking on inclines.",
    "long": "The Latin root of the word incline is inclinare, meaning \"to lean.\" As a verb, the word incline can mean to bend, so you incline your head. It can also mean to be favorably disposed toward something and you can think of it as having a bent for or leaning toward something. If the weather is nasty, you may be inclined to stay home to watch a movie with a bowl of popcorn at your side."

Cloying comes in handy to describe things that are too sweet both literally. \"Don’t worry about him trying to kiss you; your cloying perfume is sure to keep him at arm’s length.\" Or figuratively. \"Your incessant flattery and cloying way of hanging on my every word was charming at first, but now I wish you’d go away.\""

Pending is a good word to use when something has to happen before something else — like if you are learning to drive, maybe you'll have a car of your own soon, pending your success at passing the test."

  "diverge": {
    "short": "When two roads diverge, they split and go in different directions. If your opinion diverges from mine, we do not agree. To diverge means to move apart or be separate.",
    "long": "The poet, Robert Frost, wrote: \"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -/ I took the one less traveled by / And that has made all the difference.\" The word diverge in the poem carries both the meaning of separating and of being apart from the main. As a poet, it was Frost's job to use words properly. Here he does not diverge from this role."

  "amalgam": {
    "short": "In science, when you mix a metal with mercury to soften it, you create an amalgam. Otherwise, an amalgam is simply a combination of two or more unlike things into one.",
    "long": "Use amalgam when the mixture of several things creates something different and larger. If your school puts together a drug prevention task force of police, doctors, teachers, social workers, and students, the task force is an amalgam of local resources. If your band plays a combination of country music and jazz, they play an amalgam of contemporary styles. We can only hope they play it well."
  },
  "stanch": {
    "short": "Use the verb stanch to describe stopping a liquid from spreading. A bandage can stanch bleeding and thick towels can stanch the flow of water across the kitchen floor when you drop a full glass of water.",
    "long": "The vowel sound in stanch most frequently sounds like on: \"stonch.\" Stanch can also be pronounced to rhyme with branch. Though it's a verb mostly commonly associated with keeping blood from flowing from a wound, the origin is likely the Latin word stagnum, meaning \"pond, pool.\" This word is related to stagnate, describing water that has no movement."
  },
  "iniquity": {
    "short": "An iniquity is a really unfair or really immoral act. If you're a journalist, you may uncover a terrible iniquity that forces a famous politician to step down.",
    "long": "Iniquity comes from Latin, combining the prefix in-, “not,” and aequus, which means “equal” or “just.” So iniquity literally means “not just.” Iniquity can also be used to say that something lacks moral or spiritual principles. Some would call Las Vegas a “den of iniquity,” implying that sinful or wicked behavior occurs there. Others would just call it a vacation."
  },
  "abuse": {
    "short": "If you abuse someone, it means you are hurting that person, mentally, emotionally, or physically. If someone else is harming you, you are yourself suffering from abuse.",
    "long": "The word abuse is made up of two parts — \"use,\" which means to employ, and ab-, a Latin prefix meaning \"away\" — and as a whole comes from the Latin abūsus, meaning \"misuse,\" or \"use wrongly.\" It began as a verb and became a noun in the mid-15th century. Abuse also refers to anything that is employed improperly or to excess, such as the abuse of alcohol or drugs."
  },
  "pine": {
    "short": "If you pine for someone, you desperately want to see them, be with them, or perhaps smother them with kisses. If you're texting your ex-boyfriend over 50 times a day, there's a pretty good chance that you still pine for him.",
    "long": "In Old English, pine meant \"to torture or cause to experience pain,\" which seems quite fitting if you've known what it's like to pine for something or someone. The verb pine should not be confused with the noun pine, as in the evergreen tree. If you are from the Northeast and find yourself living in the Caribbean, you may pine for the sight of a pine tree, but the lovely weather should ease the pain."
  },
  "assume": {
    "short": "Assume isn't only used to mean \"accept as truth without checking\"; it also means \"take on the form of.\" It might be safer if you don't assume that the vampire standing in front of you isn't merely a person assuming that form.",
    "long": "Assume always has the sense of taking on something. It may be the belief in the appearance of truth: Your mother probably assumes you do your homework right after school. It may be another form or identity: Superman assumes the identity of a city reporter. Or, it might be a physical space: If you get nervous while driving, your dad might assume control of the car."
  },
  "abscission": {
    "short": "Abscission means the cutting off or removal of something, like an unsightly mole on the chin.",
    "long": "You can remember that abscission is all about cutting when you see how close it looks to the word scissors. If you are a public speaker who habitually cuts yourself off, your speeches may suffer from abscission. If you’re wounded in the leg in battle and gangrene sets in, you will be faced with the abscission of a limb. Layoffs at work are the abscission of workers."
  },
  "equate": {
    "short": "When you equate one thing with another, you say that they are both the same. You might equate indulging in a hot fudge sundae with giving up on your body entirely, but I would disagree.",
    "long": "To equate means to make things equal, and it’s a useful word because this is something people do all the time. They equate strong political views with fascism, they equate having lots of money with good taste, and they equate popularity with goodness. Remember, though, that just because you equate one thing with another does not mean that they really are the same! As you have no doubt noticed, equate has the Latin root equ that means \"equal, level,\" so look there if you need a reminder as to its meaning."
  },
  "equitable": {
    "short": "Equitable distribution means everyone gets their fair share of something.If you work on a group project in class, you want an equitable share of the credit.",
    "long": "When you look at equitable, you might think you see the word, equal, but it doesn't mean fair in the sense of exactly the same. If you worked ten hours at a lemonade stand and your friend worked five, you'd want an equitable share of the profits rather than an equal share. Equitable would take into account the amount of work you did, equal would not."
  },
  "fortuitous": {
    "short": "Fortuitous means by chance, like a lucky accident. If you and your best friend's families happen to go on vacation to the same place at the same time, that’s a fortuitous coincidence!",
    "long": "Something fortuitous is random like an accident, but there’s no downside. A rock falling on your head is an accident, dollar bills falling on your head is fortuitous. The meaning of fortuitous is changing from \"happening by chance\" to \"lucky chance\" because people get it mixed up with fortunate.  But watch out: If you say fortuitous to mean just plain lucky without the element of chance –– that's a usage error."
  },
  "pedestrian": {
    "short": "A pedestrian is someone traveling by foot. If you're a pedestrian, you will likely get annoyed at the drivers who don't stop so you can cross the street.",
    "long": "Pedestrian comes from the Latin pedester meaning \"going on foot\" but also \"plain.\" As a noun, it's someone walking around — sidewalks are for pedestrians. As an adjective it means \"lacking wit or imagination.\" If someone calls your new poem pedestrian, they mean it's dull. If you want to impress your friends while also making them feel worthless, mutter \"these people are SO pedestrian,\" at a party, loud enough for everyone to hear."
  },
  "truce": {
    "short": "When two warring sides decide to call it quits, it's called a truce — an agreement to end the fighting.",
    "long": "When there's a truce, the two sides stop attacking each other, catch their breath, and try to work out a peace deal. A truce isn't a permanent solution: it's more like a time-out. People with other kinds of conflicts talk about truces, too. If you and your sister are in an ongoing battle, one of you could say, \"Can we please call a truce?\" That means you'll take a break from squabbling, at least for a while."
  },
  "equivalent": {
    "short": "If two things are basically the same, you can say that they're the equivalent of each other.  Like, studying advanced physics is the equivalent of banging your head against the wall.",
    "long": "Equivalent's Latin roots are \"equal\" and \"value,\" which suggests that the word originally was used to describe things that had the same value. Now it can be used to describe things that have the same effect, or importance, or role — for example, \"England's Parliament is the  equivalent of America's Congress.\" It can also be used as an adjective: \"Eating a bowl of Sugar Pops for breakfast is equivalent to starting your day with two scoops of ice-cream.\""
  },
  "coalition": {
    "short": "A coalition is a group of people who join together for a common cause, like a coalition you form with other skateboarders who want to convince your town to build a skate park.",
    "long": "The noun coalition comes from the Latin word coalitiō, meaning \"to grow together.\" Often, the people and groups that form coalitions have different backgrounds but come together because they share a goal. For example, parents, teachers, business owners, and city council members might form a coalition to build a teen center, just as nations that do not agree on all issues might form a coalition because they all want peace."
  },
  "fervor": {
    "short": "Use fervor to describe an intensity of emotion or expression. Fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers show so much fervor that they \"bleed Dodger blue.\"",
    "long": "This noun comes to us from Latin fervere, meaning \"to boil, glow.\" In the English word fervor, the suffix –or means \"a condition or property of something.\" There is another –or suffix that means \"a person or thing that does the thing expressed by the verb.\" A corresponding adjective is fervent; synonyms of the noun and adjective are ardor and ardent."
  },
  "aristocrat": {
    "short": "An aristocrat is someone from the ruling class, usually those with nobility, money, or both. Although not an aristocrat yourself, you may have the odd viscount on your family tree if you go back far enough.",
    "long": "The word aristocrat comes from the Greek word aristokratia, which itself comes from the root words aristos, meaning \"best,\" and kratos, meaning \"rule.\" So, the aristocracy was the ruling class of (supposedly) the best and noblest people, and an aristocrat was a member of that class. Today the word can also be applied to anyone with superior standing: Count Basie was an aristocrat in the jazz world."
  },
  "distraught": {
    "short": "If you are upset, you are distraught. If you don't want to explain why you are pulling your hair out, just utter \"Leave me alone; I'm distraught.\" It'll work.",
    "long": "While distraught may sound like an old Germanic past participle, it is actually an alteration of distract from the Latin distrahere \"to draw in different directions.\" If you are distraught, you are so upset that it's hard to think straight, hence your mind is \"drawn in different directions.\""
  },
  "emulate": {
    "short": "When you emulate someone, you imitate them, especially with the idea of matching their success.",
    "long": "When someone is impressive because of their great skills, brains, strength, or accomplishments, others will emulate them. To emulate is to imitate and model yourself after someone. People emulate role models — people they want to be like. After Michael Jordan retired from the NBA, player after player tried to emulate Jordan's game and success. It's hard to be as good as someone like that, but having a hero to emulate can be helpful in many areas of life."
  },
  "eminent": {
    "short": "Anyone highly regarded or prominent is eminent. Eminent people are very successful at their jobs. If you’ve heard of Neil deGrasse Tyson, it’s probably because he’s an eminent astrophysicist.",
    "long": "Every field has eminent — impressive, famous, or accomplished — people. Two of the most eminent coaches in the history of professional basketball are Red Auerbach and Phil Jackson because they've won the most championships. Beethoven was an eminent musician. Frank Lloyd Wright was an eminent architect. Eminent people loom over a field because they're influential and you can't avoid hearing about them. It's not easy to be eminent because you have to be extremely successful."
  },
  "ennoble": {
    "short": "To ennoble someone is to make them a Lord or a Baroness — to bestow a noble title upon them. The Queen of England has the power to ennoble people, turning Paul McCartney into Sir Paul McCartney, for example.",
    "long": "One way to use the verb ennoble is to mean, literally, \"make someone a noble or a member of the nobility.\" It can also mean \"bestow or lend dignity to\" or \"make dignified.\" You could say, \"Reading great books ennobles the mind,\" or \"Treating others with kindness ennobles a person.\" Ennoble comes from the Old French ennoblir, from the prefix en-, \"put in,\" and the Latin root nobilis, \"excellent, superior, or splendid.\""
  },
  "quibble": {
    "short": "A quibble is a small argument or fight. As a verb, it means to pick a mini-fight over something that doesn't really matter. \"Let's not quibble over price,\" people will say, usually when they plan to gouge you.",
    "long": "It's better to watch figure skating with the sound off, rather than listening to the announcers quibble over a not-fully-rotated knee or the slightly diminished altitude of a jump. Sometimes a quibble between neighbors over two feet of property can escalate into a major feud."
  },
  "quintessential": {
    "short": "If someone tells you you’re the quintessential rock musician, that means they think that everything about you screams “rock and roll.” Quintessential means embodying or possessing the essence of something.",
    "long": "Some people think that baseball is the quintessential American sport. (Others might think it's stock car racing.) We also call something quintessential if it’s absolutely necessary. A quintessential part of a lasting friendship is mutual respect. Good computer skills are quintessential if you want to become the world’s greatest hacker."
  },
  "legal": {
    "short": "Legal means having to do with the law, or following the law. Attorneys work in the legal profession but may not always be so lucky as to find a legal parking spot near their office.",
    "long": "A legal scholar is someone who studies law. A legal search and seizure is when the cops come to you house with a warrant. A legal apartment is one that meets building code and is in an appropriately zoned neighborhood. Legal's opposite is illegal, which means against the law."
  },
  "placebo": {
    "short": "A patient's symptoms sometimes disappear just because they believe that they are being treated. Even when doctors give them a biologically inactive drug, otherwise known as a placebo, the patients swear they are cured.",
    "long": "In clinical drug-trials, to rule out what is called the placebo effect, scientists give half of the trial participants a placebo. If a government replaces food stamps with a coloring book give-away, it might be dismissed by child advocates as nothing more than a placebo. Placēbō is Latin for \"I'll please (you),\" in other words, I'll keep you happy, even though I'm just giving you a placebo."

  "diatribe": {
    "short": "It's pretty overwhelming when you ask your friend a seemingly innocuous question, like \"Do you like hot dogs?\" and she unleashes a diatribe about the evils of eating meat. A diatribe is an angry, critical speech.",
    "long": "This noun has its roots in the Greek diatribē, \"pastime or lecture,\" from diatrībein, \"to waste time or wear away,\" combining dia-, \"thoroughly,\" and trībein, \"to rub.\" So the origin of the word diatribe is connected to both serious study and the spending or wasting of time. With most diatribes, the speaker thinks he's well informed and knows something the listener doesn't, while to most listeners the diatribe is so angry and unhinged that it's just a waste of time."
  },
  "exigency": {
    "short": "Think of a mix of excitement and emergency, and you have exigency, a sudden, urgent crisis. The very word conjures up danger and intrigue that demand a cool head and an immediate effort at a solution.",
    "long": "The meaning of exigency is obvious from its source, the Latin noun exigentia, which means \"urgency\" and comes from the verb exigere, meaning \"to demand or require.\" An emergency situation, or  exigency, is urgent and demands immediate action. Our lives are filled with exigencies, both large and small, from a child stuck in a tree to lightning striking your house to catastrophic river flooding. Each is an exigency — it's all a matter of perspective."
  },
  "depravity": {
    "short": "Depravity goes beyond mere bad behavior — it is a total lack of morals, values, and even regard for other living things, like the depravity of a serial killer.",
    "long": "You can see the verb deprave in depravity. To deprave is to make something bad, often to the point of moral corruption, like the parental fear that a bad influence will deprave their good kids. So, depravity is behavior that is morally corrupt or otherwise deemed wicked. Don't confuse depravity with deprivation, meaning \"being denied something that is necessary.\""
  },
  "ingrain": {
    "short": "To ingrain is to deeply and strongly establish something within a person, particularly a belief or habit. You may hate those daily algebra quizzes, but they ingrain a routine of reviewing some math every night.",
    "long": "In the 14th century, this verb (originally spelled engrain) was used to mean \"dye a fabric red with cochineal.\" It comes from the French en graine, where graine means \"seed or berry,\" the source of a deep and permanent dye. To ingrain something is to fix it permanently, the way a great teacher ingrains good study habits in his students, or your distant friend's photo helps ingrain her face in your mind."
  },
  "insurrection": {
    "short": "Insurrection is an uprising against a larger force that's in power. An insurrection can lead to revolution, but it is just as likely to be put down.",
    "long": "Other words for insurrection include \"rebellion,\" \"revolt,\" and \"uprising,\" the last of which is the translation of insurrection's Latin roots. The Boston Tea Party is probably the most famous American act of insurrection. One who rises up in insurrection is called an insurgent by the force they are rising against. Like Paul Revere, insurgents are often called heroes by the people they are rising up to support."
  },
  "variegated": {
    "short": "Something variegated has many different colors, as in the trees of autumn or the feathers of a peacock. Whenever you see \"vari\" at the beginning of a word, you know that the idea of difference or change is involved.",
    "long": "Using vari is a good way to start thinking about this word. It's the same root as in various, variable, varied, and variety. All these words mean something similar: lots of different versions of something. The scales of a fish can appear quite variegated from one angle and then strangely uniform from another. A tiger's variegated coat helps it stay hidden."
  },
  "preclude": {
    "short": "To preclude something is to prevent it from happening. A muzzle precludes a dog from biting.",
    "long": "This is a very formal word, but it has a simple meaning: when something is precluded, it can't happen. See the prefix pre in preclude and in prevent? It is signaling that these words are all about things done before another action would happen — to make it impossible. Staying away from water precludes the possibility of drowning, though it also precludes any chance of having fun swimming."
  },
  "peremptory": {
    "short": "Peremptory comments are like orders. If you say something in a peremptory manner, you want people to stop what they’re doing and do what you say. Peremptory comments put an end to a discussion, and that’s final!",
    "long": "The word peremptory comes from the Latin peremptorius for “decisive, final.” Trace it further and find that peremptor  means \"destroyer,\" from perimpere for \"destroy, cut off.” Basically, peremptory commands destroy the conversation. They are given with an air of authority, and they are often barked. In the courtroom, peremptory orders are not open to appeal; they’re final. Outside of the courtroom, a peremptory manner is just plain rude."
  },
  "pigeonhole": {
    "short": "A pigeonhole is a small nesting area for a pigeon, or a similarly cozy compartment or alcove. If you feel like you're stuck in a restrictive category — only thought of as someone's sister, for example — that's another kind of pigeonhole.",
    "long": "A cubbyhole in your desk is one kind of pigeonhole, and the little box where a domesticated pigeon sleeps is another. These original meanings date from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the 1870s, pigeonhole had also come to mean \"an overly simplistic or restrictive category,\" and also \"to assign someone to a rigid category.\" So when you assume that a circus clown couldn't also be a brilliant mathematician, you have pigeonholed him."

  "prodigious": {
    "short": "Something exceptional, substantial, or great is prodigious. A blizzard includes prodigious wind and snow. A prodigious writer is one who can write a lot and do it well.",
    "long": "Prodigious is a word for things that are impressive. If you have prodigious strength, you're very strong. If your cat had a prodigious litter of kittens, then you've got a houseful of kittens. This is a strong word that's also kind of formal. Save it for things that really blow you away because of their quality or quantity. A little drizzle isn't a prodigious rain, but a storm that floods a whole city certainly is."
  },
  "gloat": {
    "short": "If you gloat, you express great satisfaction at the misfortune of others. If your team scores a big win, it would be better not to gloat. Be happy for your win, but don't laugh at the other team's loss.",
    "long": "Gloat seems have come from a Germanic word meaning \"to stare.\" Somehow people may have gotten the sense that whoever was doing the staring was also taking a deep and unwholesome pleasure in whatever he or she was seeing. Think about people staring and pointing and laughing. Sometimes you gloat when someone has rejected the help you have offered. If your little sister won't listen to your advice on how to improve her essay and then comes home with a bad grade, it will be very hard not to gloat and say \"I told you so.\""
  },
  "equivocate": {
    "short": "When you are unwilling to make a decision and almost intentionally go back and forth between two choices, you are equivocating. When politicians equivocate, they are often afraid of upsetting, and thus alienating, voters with their decisions.",
    "long": "A key part of equivocate is the root vocate, which comes from the Latin vocare or \"voice.\" When you give your voice to two opposing views in order to mislead or keep your options open, you're equivocating. Think of the expression, to talk out of both sides of your mouth. If you want to go to a party and your parents keep saying \"maybe, it depends,\" tell them to stop equivocating and give you a straight answer."

  "quarrel": {
    "short": "To quarrel is to fight — but usually not physically. Quarreling is a fact of life, occurring between the best of friends, in the happiest of marriages, and between parents and their children.",
    "long": "You’re probably familiar with the verb, quarrel, meaning having a disagreement.  When there’s a quarrel, there’s anger. As a noun, quarrel, refers to the square-headed arrow shot from crossbow. This meaning of the word comes from the Old French quarel, relating to \"square.” If you are quarreling, just don't reach for your crossbow and quarrel."

  "intransigent": {
    "short": "Intransigent means inflexible, stubborn, entrenched. Argue all you like with an intransigent three-year-old. He will never back down from the position that he wants the lollipop NOW.",
    "long": "Trans has to do with movement — think transportation, or a package in transit, i.e. \"on the way.\" The in- of intransigent means \"not,\" so something or someone who is intransigent is not moving. If one political party wants to raise funds to improve schools but the other is intransigent on the subject of higher taxes, the debate will get nowhere."
